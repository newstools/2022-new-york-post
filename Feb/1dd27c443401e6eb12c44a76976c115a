A Maryland man was arrested with a loaded gun outside a Queens police precinct over the weekend, authorities said. Anthony Gamez, 30, was in front of the 114th Precinct station house on Astoria Boulevard near 35th Street in Astoria around 11:30 a.m. Sunday when an officer noticed a bulge in his pocket, cops said. He was later stopped and found in possession of a loaded Springfield armory firearm, according to authorities and police sources. Gamez, from Beltsville, a suburb of Washington, DC, was charged with criminal possession of a firearm and possession of a large-capacity ammunition magazine, police said. He has no prior arrests in the Big Apple, cops said.
