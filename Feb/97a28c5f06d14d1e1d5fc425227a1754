Donald Trump and his kids Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. won’t testify as part of the New York Attorney General’s probe into the Trump Organization’s business dealings despite a judge’s order last week, according to a new report. Last week, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordered the Trump trio to comply with the AG’s subpoenas to be deposed by March 10. But the former president’s lawyer Ron Fischetti told Business Insider in a report Thursday that he believes the case will be put on hold after they file an appeal of Engoron’s decision next week. The Trumps will ask for a stay pending that appeal. “They are not going to testify by March 10,” Fischetti told the outlet. “I don’t think anybody thought that they were going to testify by that date.” The judge’s decision came after a lengthy hearing Thursday where Trump’s lawyers asked to quash NY AG Letitia James’ subpoenas accusing her of seeking to advance her career by targeting Trump for “selective prosecution.” James’ office opened up an investigation into the family company in 2019 following congressional testimony from Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen that Trump exaggerated his company’s assets on annual financial statements in order to secure better terms on loans and for tax purposes. The office then filed a lawsuit against the company and Eric Trump in 2020 claiming that they were stonewalling her probe. Eric has already been deposed in the case, while James’ office began seeking the depositions of Trump, Ivanka and Don. Jr. three months ago. The AG’s office did not immediately return a request for comment.
