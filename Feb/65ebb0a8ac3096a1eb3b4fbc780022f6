Snopes.com has shifted its “fact check” on the news that the Biden administration would be offering free crack pipes as part of a $30 million program from “mostly false” to “outdated” — the latest move in a remarkable drive to make the story just go away. It all started when The Washington Free Beacon broke the news, citing public documents. As meme-makers went wild, social media circled the wagons to try to protect the Biden administration. Instagram attached a “missing context” label to posts, while Facebook went with “false information” after a ruling from partisan “fact checkers.” Snopes then stepped in with its “mostly false” judgment, on the basis that the program in question would also give away free needles, etc. (as the Beacon had reported). But the publicity didn’t stop, so the administration “clarified” that free crack pipes are now off the table. That cleared the deck for Snopes to switch in “outdated” — while sniffing about the supposed “wave of grossly misleading news coverage” that got Team Biden to shift. None of which changes the fact that the free crack pipes were real, until actual reporting got the word out. Proving once again that social media and their supposed “independent” fact checkers are just an extension of the Democratic Party.
