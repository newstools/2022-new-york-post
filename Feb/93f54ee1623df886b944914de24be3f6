Four years after their infamous wardrobe malfunction, the only fashion-related thought for French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron are the new gold medals around their necks. The duo captured gold in team ice dance in dominant fashion, breaking their own world record in the process. Their free dance performance, skated to “Elegie” by Gabriel Faure, scored 136.15, with a world record total score of 226.98. “I think we don’t believe it yet. Honestly, it feels completely unreal,” Papadakis told Eurosport after the performance, per News.com.au. “We have been waiting for this. This is the medal that we wanted. My brain doesn’t understand it.” In PyeongChang, the duo missed out on gold by the slimmest of margins, doomed by their headline-grabbing gaffe. While Cizeron was attempting to lift Papadakis, he mistakenly unclipped a clasp on the back of her dress. She did her best to complete the rest of the performance, constantly grasping at her dress in order to not expose herself, but the damage was done. “It was pretty distracting, kind of my worst nightmare happening at the Olympics,” Papadakis said at the time. This time around, however, Cizeron was able to lift Papadakis and her sparkling silver dress without a problem. The last on the ice to perform their free dance, Papadakis and Cizeron left no doubt this time around in obliterating the rest of the field. Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of the Russian Olympic Committee claimed silver, followed by Americans Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue who won bronze. On Saturday night, Cizeron and Papadakis broke their own world record in rhythm dance – the first part of team ice dancing.  “We are super happy with our performance, we are in a totally different place from where we were four years ago,” Cizeron said. “Mentally and in terms of preparation too. We did not have a good memory of the short program there. We are super happy with our performance so indeed, it is a little revenge.”
