LeBron James could barely contain himself. Before the 2022 NBA All-Star Game tipped off, James was shown on camera smiling and struggling to keep himself from laughing during Macy Gray’s national-anthem performance. The Grammy Award-winning R&B singer sang a peculiar version of “The Star Spangled Banner,” particularly in her melodic and vocal decisions near the end of the performance. She was accompanied by a guitarist. Immediately after her last note, Gray’s performance began trending on Twitter. It was a similar scene to Fergie’s performance before the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, when stars Steph Curry and Draymond Green were shown visibly confused and laughing at the 46-year-old’s rendition of the anthem. Born Natalie Renée McIntyre, the 54-year-old Gray has been nominated for five Grammy Awards, winning one. It’s not the first time the All-Star Game has provided amusement for James, who is playing in his 18th edition of the game and captaining one of the squads. As James and Kevin Durant drafted their respective teams for the game, James couldn’t hold back his laughter, and covered his face, as Durant explained his reasoning for selecting Rudy Gobert over James Harden when the two were the only remaining players yet to be chosen. The draft took place just hours after the Nets dealt Harden to the 76ers as part of their blockbuster deal to land Ben Simmons.
