The NBA All-Star Game will now have its own alternate broadcast featuring Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal and the recently signed Draymond Green. For Sunday night’s game, Turner has shifted its plan and will have Barkley team with the rest of the “Inside the NBA” crew, including Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith, to opine on the game on TBS. TNT will add some bells and whistles, too, but it will be a little more traditional. Turner Sports announced the moves on Tuesday. Though ESPN and Turner pioneered the concept of offering different broadcasts than the regular play-by-play and analyst approach, it has gained momentum with Nickelodeon’s success with the Nate Burleson-led SpongeBob-focused NFL playoff game and ESPN2’s Manningcast on “Monday Night Football.” The “Inside the NBA” broadcast will also feature players being mic’d up — including Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell and Ja Morant. With Barkley staying with his regular studio partners, Dwyane Wade will join Reggie Miller and Kevin Harlan in TNT’s main booth. Allie LaForce will be on the sideline. They will be joined by different members of the 75th anniversary all-time team throughout the game. The Post had reported that Barkley would be with Harlan and Miller, which was Turner’s original plan. It subbed Wade in for Barkley when it finalized the “Inside the NBA” broadcast on TBS.
