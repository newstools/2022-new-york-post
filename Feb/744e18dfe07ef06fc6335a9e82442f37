A second NFL player is a suspect in Saints running back Alvin Kamara’s assault arrest. According to Las Vegas CBS affiliate 8 News Now, Chiefs defensive back and special teamer Chris Lammons was also involved in an altercation the night before the Pro Bowl on the Vegas strip. The police report said that Kamara punched alleged victim Darnell Greene in the face at Drai’s After Hours at The Cromwell, and punched him more when he was down, while three other associates of Kamara’s stomped on the victim. Per 8 News Now, two of Kamara’s three associates were arrested by Las Vegas police on Thursday night, and Lammons is the third they are searching for. Kamara, who was arrested after the Pro Bowl at the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium, admitted to throwing punches. He said he did so to prevent Greene from running away, but his story was allegedly contradicted by surveillance videos. Greene suffered a broken eye socket in the incident. The Saints running back has been charged with felony assault causing bodily harm. Lammons, 26, spent the 2018 season on multiple practice squads and played for the Dolphins for most of 2019. He was waived late in the season and added by the Chiefs, where he has rotated a number of times between the practice squad and main roster.
