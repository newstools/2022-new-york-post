Eminem kneeled on stage during his Super Bowl 2022 halftime show performance, and the NFL has denied a report that the league objected to the “Colin Kaepernick-style” gesture According to a report from Puck, the rapper was at odds with the NFL over kneeling “Colin Kaepernick-style” during a star-studded halftime show that also featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent. But NFL reps denied the league had any differences with Eminem before his performance. In a statement to The Post, the reps said players have been taking a knee since 2016 without sanctions, so musical talent wouldn’t be held to a different standard. League officials also knew going into Sunday that the rapper would take a knee because officials “watched it during rehearsals this week,” an NFL spokesman said. The report from Puck says league organizers “also flagged something that Snoop Dogg was set to wear as possibly appearing gang-related.” Dr. Dre had a lot of back-and-forth aggravations in planning his set, according to the report. The report cites a source close to Dre as saying the rapper felt “disgustingly censored.” Beyond not wanting cursing, the league was said to have been uncomfortable with a lyric in “Still D.R.E.” — “still not loving police” — because it did not want this performance to be a “divisive culture war moment.”
