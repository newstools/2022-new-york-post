Can they keep up with the tempo? In the new trailer for “Watch Out for the Big Grrrls,” Lizzo is searching for the perfect backup dancers in hopes of giving plus-sized performers the recognition they deserve. The series, which will be available to stream on Amazon Prime Video on March 25, follows the three-time Grammy award winner on the hunt for the best twerkers in town. “Girls that look like me don’t get representation,” Lizzo, 33, says in the trailer. “Time to pull up my sleeves, and find ‘em myself.” Throughout the eight-episode series, 10 women participate in Lizzo’s boot camp, competing for the coveted spot as her back-up dancer, all while dodging drama in the Big Grrrls House where they’ll be staying. “It’s the battle of the big girls,” the “Juice” singer, who also is an executive producer on the show, declares. Lizzo also preaches self-love and encourages the dancers to be confident in themselves in the series, which coincides with her body-positive messages on social media. The series, which is directed by Nneka Onuorah, is produced by Amazon Studios and Bunim-Murray Productions, as well as Lizzo’s own production company Lizzo Bangers.
