A 16-year-old boy was arraigned Wednesday on a murder charge for the brazen broad daylight shooting of another teenager on a Westchester County street, authorities said. A grand jury indicted Tommy Rivera for the killing of Julian Oliveros, a 16-year-old who was shot multiple times in New Rochelle on the afternoon of Jan. 25, county District Attorney Mimi Rocah announced in a news release. Rivera is facing a second-degree murder charge and two counts of criminal weapons possession, Rocah said. The alleged shooter had reportedly been arrested the day of the killing just a half a mile from the shooting with a handgun in his possession, reports said at the time. The teenager used a 9mm semi-automatic gun in the shooting, on Washington Avenue and Fourth Street, according to lohud.com. New Rochelle, a city of 80,000 within the suburban county, held a community forum in the wake of the killing with New Rochelle schools Superintendent Jonathan Raymond telling residents “we failed them,” according to the news site. “And the community failed them and it’s important that we acknowledge that,” Raymond told attendees at the town-hall style forum, lohud said. “I and many of us here wish we could turn back the clock and change the events that had happened but we cannot.” Both teens were students in the New Rochelle public school system but didn’t “regularly attend” classes, according to the news site. City Mayor Noam Bramson called the incident a “senseless act of violence” in a statement following the shooting. “More broadly, this incident highlights yet again the destructive impact of our nation’s lax gun regulations, which flood firearms into the wrong hands and can transform any dispute into a heartbreaking loss,” Bramson, a Democrat, said.
