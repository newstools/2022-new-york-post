The US Coast Guard was searching for a passenger that jumped overboard on a Carnival cruise ship into the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday. The Carnival Valor vessel was en route to New Orleans from Cozumel, Mexico when a woman jumped into the water from her balcony, Carnival said in a statement. An air rescue was underway Wednesday as the ship circled the area where the 32-year-old woman went into the water, 150 miles off the shore of Louisiana, the Coast Guard said. “Carnival’s CARE team is providing support to the guest’s husband who was traveling with her,” according to the statement. One man on board the ship tweeted a video of a life preserver and a flare spewing red smoke trailing behind the vessel’s stern. The ship had been slated to return to New Orleans on Thursday. The incident came two months after a woman died in the Pacific Ocean after going overboard on another Carnival ship. The FBI was investigating the incident amid allegations of foul play.
