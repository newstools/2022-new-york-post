She’s more than just a real hot girl. Megan Thee Stallion is taking her act from arena stages to the big screen as she makes her film debut in the raunchy musical comedy “F- -king Identical Twins.” The project also stars Bowen Yang (“Saturday Night Live”), two-time Emmy-winner Megan Mullally (“Will & Grace”) and Tony-winner Nathan Lane (“The Producers”), and is directed by “Seinfeld” veteran Larry Charles, according to multiple outlets on Thursday. The A24 film stars comedians Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp in what a Hollywood Reporter insider described as “a subversive spin on ‘The Parent Trap,'” about two career adversaries who learn they are twins separated at birth. The story is based on a two-man live set developed  and performed by Jackson and Sharp in 2014. The announcement marks a big shift in the career of 27-year-old musician Stallion, who celebrated the new venture on Thursday with her more than 27 million fans on Instagram. “HOTTIES THIS IS OUR FIRST MOVIEEEE/ MUSICAL! WITH SOME MOVIE LEGENDS,” the “Savage” rapper wrote in the caption next to a screenshot of the Reporter’s report. “I’m so excited i feel so blessed i feel anxious lol i feel a bunch of s–t,” the three-time Grammy-winner added. “I really have been quietly putting in this work and i just cant wait for the hotties to see everything .” In an Instagram Story, Yang, 31, also thanked “genius freaks” Jackson and Sharp for creating “the foulest, funniest movie imaginable.”
