NBA All-Star weekend kicks off Friday and Brandon Anderson and Matt Moore of The Action Network are here to break down the Rising Star game. For Moore, he likes the value on Team Payton based on the construction of its roster. “I get LaMelo [Ball], I get Scottie Barnes [and] I get Ayo Dosunmu, who has been awesome,” Moore explains. Bettors can get Team Payton at +300 to win the first All-Star weekend event. As for Anderson, he believes Team Payton is the weakest team and is choosing to target Team Worthy at +350. “The thing with this team when you first see it is: did you forget to draft forwards and centers?” Anderson wonders. “But it’s an All-Star game – who needs to defend, who needs big men? Let’s just run and gun and take a bunch of shots.”
