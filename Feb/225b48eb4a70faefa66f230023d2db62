Music makes us thrive, improves our mood, gets us motivated, and calms us down. It’s an outlet we can all agree on liking and with music, life is so much better. But listening to music is one thing, but playing it? A whole ‘nother story. It takes a lot of skill to make your own music, whether it’s playing an instrument or writing a song. Being able to do both is an admirable trait. Don’t know how to do either? Well you just may like what this training bundle has to offer. The 2022 All-in-One Piano & Musician Training Bundle will teach you all you need to know when it comes to learning piano, guitar, and writing your own songs. The bundle includes 8 courses with 55 hours of writing songs, playing instruments, and more. You’ll come out of this program a whole new and improved you with brand new skills to boot!  You’ll learn popular piano rhythm styles first, similar to those of Billy Joel and Norah Jones, and then move on to soft melodies next and then blues and jazz. Then you’ll continue with beginner guitar lessons that help you find certain notes, learn basic chords, and discover new techniques. You can learn how to compose songs or be a better keyboard player with this music-related course bundle. Alongside that, you’ll also take courses on sound production and end up being able to produce your own songs. You will also be shown some of the essentials of music theory in Ableton Live 11.
