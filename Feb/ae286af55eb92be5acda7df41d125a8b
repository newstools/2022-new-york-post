Park rangers at Point Reyes National Seashore in California have warned the public not to get too close to adorable elephant seal pups, according to a report. The large amphibious creatures are multiplying quickly, SFGATE reported, with a record 1,370 females counted at the peak of the 2022 season. There are now so many, parkgoers are encountering them near the visitors center and in the parking lot. “Visitors should keep a distance of at least 25 feet (or two car lengths) from seals that are seen outside of closed areas,” marine ecologist Sarah Codde told the outlet. “The park does close pupping areas from public access to protect moms and pups, but also to protect visitors because the adult females are very protective of their pups and can be aggressive towards people that get too close.” Male seals spend most of the day at rest — they lie so still they can be mistaken for boulders. Without warning, however, one may challenge another to fight, a mating-driven battle between creatures weighing up to 5,000 pounds. “Visitors need to be aware of how quickly the situation can change and be prepared to move out of the way of the seals,” Codde said. “This is a unique opportunity to be able to view elephant seals from a close distance and we hope to keep doing this as long as people continue to respectfully view the seals.”
