Grammy-winning musician and record producer Pharrell Williams should be happy, because he’s sold a stunning trophy home in Los Angeles — and not for a song. Mansion Global reports that the 48-year-old Williams snagged $9.2 million for the deal, which has yet to hit public records. The gated property first hit the market for $11.95 million in May 2020 and eventually lowered its asking price to $9.99 million. Williams bought the home in 2015 for $7.14 million. And while he’s known to shell out six figures for a shiny set of grills, Williams also has a taste for fine property. Located above Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, architect Hagy Belzberg built the property in 2007 — and won some award for it in the process, such as from the American Institute of Architects, California Council. If 6,000 square feet of living space, floor-to-ceiling windows and a formal living room adorned with a statement fireplace aren’t enough, then head outside. Out there, the new owner can screen flicks in an outdoor movie theater and catch air at a private skate park. What’s more, there’s also a 70-foot infinity pool, a spa, multiple decks for entertaining and — should visitors need a place to crash — a one-bedroom guest house. Back inside, there’s a chef’s kitchen and five bedrooms — one of which is the master suite that boasts a video wall. The purchaser has yet to be identified. Rayni and Branden Williams of The Beverly Hills Estates, who didn’t respond to a message seeking comment, marketed the listing.
