A sprawling ranch in the Texas Panhandle where the late corporate raider and oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens spent most weekends for half a century has just undergone a massive $80 million price chop to $170 million. Pickens first put his vast, 64,672-acre estate, known as Mesa Vista — 85 miles northeast of Amarillo — on the market for $250 million in 2017, according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.com. The next year, at age 90, he closed his hedge fund and started auctioning off prized possessions — such as the ranch home’s conference table, modeled after a 19th-century British Regency manor house table and similar to the Presidential Cabinet Room table in the White House, according to reports. That’s where the legendary oilman made and lost billions, while meeting with presidents like George W. Bush, presidential candidates like Donald Trump, presidential widows, like Nancy Reagan, sports legends like Alex Rodriguez and country stars like Garth Brooks. Pickens died at age 91 in 2019. The ranch includes a 6,000-square-foot home, the Oklahoma home where he grew up, a 12,000-square-foot lake house, a 33,000-square-foot lodge and a chapel where Pickens married his fifth wife. It also features a pub, a palatial stone kennel for up to 40 dogs and a vet lab. There’s even an art gallery, a 9-hole golf course, tennis courts, at least 20 ponds — and a private airport, with a runway and a hangar that comes with a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment above it for the pilots. Some of the art that was showcased at the estate was sold at auction in October 2020 — for $20 million total. It was replaced with less valuable pieces, the listing broker, Monte Lyons, of Hall & Hall, in Lubbock, Texas, tells Gimme Shelter, adding that “a handful of smaller items” were donated for display at Oklahoma State University.
