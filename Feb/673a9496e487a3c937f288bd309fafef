This Bravo celeb is flipping out of his own home. Jeff Lewis, 51, has sold his custom-designed high-tech Hollywood Hills, California, home for $5.2 million. Records show the “Flipping Out” star and interior designer purchased the home for $3.13 million in 2016. Over the years he added his personal touch, bringing luxury finishes to the residence including a Sonos system controlled by iPads, an advanced security system and Lutron lighting throughout. Initially listing the three-bedroom, four-bathroom abode in 2020 for $5.8 million, the “Jeff Lewis Has Issues” podcast host cut the price to $5.5 million a month later. But after a brief time on the market, Lewis removed the listing in November of that year. Pegged as an “ultra-private, modern masterpiece,” the estate is situated above the famed Sunset Strip, boasting city and ocean views. Described as a “one-of-a-kind home,” the main living area features an open floor plan with high ceilings and several windows to bring in natural light. The great room comes with a custom wet bar and sliding glass doors to open to an outdoor deck. The deck opens out to the pool and spa. Made with custom stained white oak cabinetry, the expansive kitchen comes with marble countertops and top-of-the-line appliances, as noted by the previous listing held by Heather Altman with Douglas Elliman. The primary suite boasts panoramic city views, a dressing room, spa-like bathroom with an oversized rainfall shower and freestanding tub. TMZ was the first to report the transaction.
