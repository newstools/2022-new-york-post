One man was killed and a woman was injured during a home invasion in Suffolk County early Thursday morning, police said. The Suffolk County Police Department said that “multiple people” broke into a home at 5 Everglades Lane in Coram around 3:45 a.m. on Thursday. Eric Westby, 46, who lived at the residence, was shot. He was transported to John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson where he was pronounced dead. A female resident was also struck with a pistol during the invasion and was treated at a local hospital. Two other residents were home at the time, but neither one was injured, according to police. Suffolk Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison told News 12 that the burglars appeared to be after drugs. “It looks like this location was definitely targeted for some kind of narcotics,” Harrison said. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing, police said.
