Snootie Wild died after being shot in Houston Friday, the second Memphis rapper to be gunned down in recent months. The “Yayo” artist’s death was confirmed on his verified Instagram page Saturday evening. “Gone in body, but your NAME & LEGACY will live forever! #TeamYayo4Life,” the post read. Wild was found shot in the neck in a ditch next to an SUV around 2 p.m. by Texas police, according to ABC 13, a report that was later linked to Wild’s death. “It looks like he backed in there (the ditch) accidentally. Then the other vehicle pulled up, and folks got out of the car,” a Houston officer told the outlet. “They were talking for a little bit, and then all of a sudden, gunfire went off. Only one shot, actually.” The 36-year old, born LePreston Porter, was not immediately pronounced dead and was fighting for his life Friday afternoon, his Facebook page said. There was no word on any arrests in connection with the murder. Tributes from hip hop artists like Sonny Digital and Three 6 Mafia’s DJ Paul poured in on social media for the Yo Gotti protégé. The news came after rapper Young Dolph, who had a long running feud with Gotti, was shot dead outside a Memphis bakery in a broad-daylight ambush. Three suspects were arrested in connection with that murder, and Gotti was not implicated.
