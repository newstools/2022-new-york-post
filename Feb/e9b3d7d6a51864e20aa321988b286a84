Texas versus Texas Tech isn’t traditionally a big rivalry in college basketball. That changed this season with now-Texas head coach Chris Beard’s departure from Texas Tech leaving a lot of hatred for him in Lubbock. That showed during the first meeting between these teams on Feb. 1, when a raucous Red Raiders crowd created arguably the loudest home court of the college basketball season thus far. But Saturday will be a difficult road spot for Texas Tech. Texas Tech won that first matchup relatively comfortably, 77-64, but Texas has improved its turnover issues since then and has wins against Kansas and at Oklahoma. The Longhorns and Red Raiders are similar in a lot of ways, but Texas Tech’s offense has been prone to flat spots and stretches of scoreless droughts on the road. This matchup favors the Longhorns if Courtney Ramey can make his perimeter jump shots. While these defenses are very similar stylistically, the Longhorns guard the perimeter at a much better rate. That will leave open looks for Ramey, who didn’t make them in a brutal road environment in that first meeting, but is a 36 percent shooter who should be better from deep on his home floor. The edge will come down to which offense makes more shots from the perimeter and how well Texas Tech can prevent turnovers on the road. Even with guard Kevin McCullar, the Red Raiders could have turnover issues against the Longhorns. And if McCullar doesn’t play, they could be doomed. Regardless of McCullar’s final status, the Longhorns are undervalued to take down the Red Raiders relatively comfortably. The play: Texas, -3.
