A Florida mom helped her 14-year-old son take meth and had the kid hallucinating from the drug, a report said. Cheryl Ann Asiq, 38, allegedly held foil with heated methamphetamine while the teenager used a straw to take a hit of the vapors in Pasco County, WFLA-TV reported. Asiq gave the teen meth three separate times between Thursday and Saturday, when a family member called the house and spoke with the boy who was “hallucinating” from the drugs, the TV station said. The mom then hopped on the line and told the unidentified relative the kid had just taken a Xanax pill, the report said. After an ambulance showed up to take the teenager to a hospital for treatment, Asiq allegedly called him and told him he should lie about where he got the meth. “She initially said the teenager got the drugs while she was in the shower, but later admitted to giving him the drugs herself, thinking it would help him relax,” the WFLA report stated. Asiq was slapped with charges of child abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the report said.
