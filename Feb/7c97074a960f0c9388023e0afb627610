You wouldn’t call yourself lazy (especially if you’re trying to land a new job or just a job), but you have to admit, you wish the job application process were a bit less tedious and well, boring. Did you know that on average, it takes 21 to 80 job applications to get one job offer? That almost doesn’t seem fair for all of the hard work you put in during the application process. What if we introduced you to a way where you could apply to more than one job on multiple different platforms at once to make the whole song and dance less of a headache? It’s called LazyApply and it’s not only for the lazy! The LazyApply Job Application: Lifetime Subscription will help you apply to hundreds of jobs a day with the convenience of a single click.
