“Saturday Night Live” cast member Chris Redd’s impersonation of Mayor Eric Adams was interrupted by the Democrat himself on a local morning news TV segment Wednesday. The piece began with Redd dusting off his spoof of the mayor during a virtual live interview with Fox 5 “Good Day New York” anchor Rosanna Scotto. “New York City, this is your mayor. Bing Bong! Eric Adams. You understand? Listen,” he said, playing up the mayor’s Brooklyn accent, confidence and “swag.” “It’s so good to be here, I haven’t seen someone this beautiful since I woke up this morning,” he told Scotto, as the real mayor unexpectedly joined the Zoom call from City Hall. When asked what he thought of Redd’s caricature, Adams heaped praise on the comic. “I love it but he didn’t have my smoothie,” he said, adding that Redd also forgot to wear an earring. “I feel like I’ve known him for all my life, the rest of my life because he has it down pat. He has my bracelets, he has my silver watch,” Adams joked. Redd, 36, said he felt like he had a bond with the mayor, who is 25 years his senior. “You were like the first person, like political person, where I was like, ‘Oh yeah I know that dude.’ That dude right there — he’s like three of my uncles that guy, you know what I mean? I knew exactly how to make that happen,” Redd explained to his muse. “I’m gonna give you a lot of content Chris, trust me,” Adams retorted between laughs. Adams did not discuss any political issues during the segment. “SNL” was slated to return live to the airwaves Saturday after an extended break to accommodate NBC’s Winter Olympics coverage. John Mulaney was set to host for the fifth time with Brooklyn’s LCD Soundsystem performing.
