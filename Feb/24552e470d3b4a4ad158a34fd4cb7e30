Google Maps explorers have been left stunned and confused after finding a child hanging out of a BIN. The distur-bin discovery was spotted in a park in Switzerland. It’s the latest in a string of unusual and odd findings on the platform over the years. TikToker The Google Earth Guy was challenged to find it by one of his 1.1million followers. “I have so many questions on to how he got there,” he said. The TikTok star takes weird and obscure requests from other users and attempts to find them on Google Maps. The kid he found was seen in the Parc de Valency, in the Swiss city of Lausanne. It actually dates back to 2010 but has only come to light now. Users were baffled that the TikToker actually managed to pull it off. “What the hell,” one said. “HOW,” another asked. The Google Earth Guy has discovered all sorts of oddities, including the real hills shown in the iconic Windows XP wallpaper background, a Spider-Man cosplaying and even an explosion. And the child in the bin is completely real too. You can see it for yourself by entering the coordinates 46°31’42.0″N 6°36’47.0″E on Google Maps and switching to Street View mode.
