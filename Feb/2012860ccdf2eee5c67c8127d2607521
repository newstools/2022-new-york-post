The premiere episode of “America’s Got Talent: Extreme” finally aired Monday night — and Jonathan Goodwin, who was injured on set last year, has been released from the hospital. After a stunt gone wrong back in October, Goodwin — who turned 42 on Sunday — was admitted into the hospital for four months. He shared a sweet snap of him and his fiancé, British actress Amanda Abbington, on Instagram, while also revealing it’s his birthday. “Four months later … finally out of hospital. My birthday today” he captioned the photo of the couple wrapped in a cozy blanket and sporting stocking caps. “Can’t think of a better way to spend it than with my love.” The daredevil was nearly crushed as he was suspended 70 feet in the air between two cars — while wearing a straitjacket. A gruesome viral video showed the extreme escape artist being smashed as the cars erupted into flames upon impact, causing Goodwin to drop to the ground and his his head. The traumatic injury caused the NBC show to be halted temporarily, as “the health and safety of our cast and crew continue to be [their] priority,” said a spokesperson from the series at the time. But UK-based Goodwin is no stranger to near-death experiences, frequently performing stunts that seem impossible. Yet, the stuntman stayed positive, even posting a lighthearted selfie on Instagram while donning his bloodied face. “To death I say nananana boo boo,” Goodwin captioned the photo. “There is a long road to recovery and that won’t look like what it did.”
