Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen who beat homicide charges after killing two people at a Kenosha, Wis., protest, is planning to sue LeBron James after the basketball pro allegedly defamed him on social media, reports said Thursday. Rittenhouse announced plans to sue a host of A-listers and media organizations earlier this week but has since added James to the list because the sports great made fun of him on Twitter during his November trial last year, TMZ reported. “What tears????? I didn’t see one. Man knock it off! That boy ate some lemon heads before walking into court,” James wrote on Nov. 10 alongside a video that showed Rittenhouse breaking down on the stand as he recounted the moments he killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26. Once Rittenhouse was acquitted of the charges, he shot back at James in December, saying he used to be a fan of the pro. “I liked LeBron,” Rittenhouse said on The BlazeTV’s “You Are Here” show. “And, then I’m like, ‘You know what, f— you, LeBron.'” Rittenhouse announced the creation of The Media Accountability Project on Monday and said it’ll be used to fund legal battles against media organizations and A-listers who called him a “murderer” and spread “lies” about him before and after he was acquitted. “I don’t want to see anybody else have to deal with what I went through,” he told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, adding that he is looking “at quite a few politicians, celebrities, athletes” and “Whoopi Goldberg’s on the list.” “She called me a ‘murderer’ after I was acquitted by a jury of my peers. She went on to still say that,” he said. “And there’s others, don’t forget about Cenk [Uygur] from ‘The Young Turks.’ He called me a murderer before verdict and continues to call me a murderer.” Rittenhouse also wants to sue President Biden for calling him a white supremacist. “We’re definitely going to be holding him accountable, too,” the teen said.
