Alongside items like thick tights and a chic coat, a turtleneck is a must-have for the colder winter months. And, according to a fashion lover, there is a correct way of wearing it to achieve a neater look. Holly Reardon, from New England, shared the hack on TikTok, where it’s gone viral, amassing over 4.9 million views since being uploaded. ”Okay, one time I was wearing a turtleneck on here and someone commented: ”Tuck your turtleneck inside instead of outside” – that comment changed my life. ”This looks so much better,” said the YouTuber whilst demonstrating the two versions, with the ”regular” one looking baggy. ”Whoever that was – thank you,” Holly ended the video, which some branded ”life-changing” and ”genius’.’ ”Why this gotta show up after I wore my turtle neck the other way to work today,” said a viewer who appeared to have seen the clip a little too late. The trick made some reflect on other daily tasks, with people claiming they probably don’t know how to do anything correctly. ”So you’re telling me I’ve been wearing turtlenecks wrong too? Have I ever done anything right in my life??” wondered someone. However, it also appeared that this was nothing revolutionary, with a couple of users claiming they had been folding their turtlenecks the ”right” way all along. ”We did this in the ’90s. Glad someone let you in on it!” commented one. A second added: ”I literally did this today bc I always do this and now I’m mad I didn’t make a TikTok about it lol.” Despite the overall positive reviews and comments, not everyone was impressed, like this person who said: ”Actually I like it the other way!” ”My sensory issues said no,” read a comment by someone who most likely won’t try the hack. ”Yea I like the baggy neck look,” a third preferred the ”incorrect” way.
