Oscar De La Hoya is so content in his relationship with Holly Sonders and other work ventures that he’s putting boxing behind him. “I feel complete now. I have six projects aside from boxing that I’m working on right now that are huge – mega. I’ve refocused. I have the energy. I have a woman by my side who makes me feel like King Kong,” De La Hoya, 49, told BoxingScene.com in an interview published last week. “It’s motivating. It really is. I can’t wait to see what’s going to happen with Golden Boy and my personal brand. Things are moving in the right direction. I’m really excited about it.” The Hall of Fame boxer and Sonders, a sports reporter and host, went public with their relationship last summer. “I can’t imagine myself in the ring anymore. I’m hanging up the gloves for sure and calling it a day,” De La Hoya said. “It’s not likely [I will fight again]. I’m not feeling it. I went through so much in training. I was on it. When I trained, I left everything and my focus was 100%. It just drained me. I couldn’t handle it.” De La Hoya added that he still has “breathing problems” while running following a bout with COVID-19 that left him hospitalized last September. The health scare caused him to cancel his pay-per-view fight against former MMA fighter Vitor Belfort. Last November, De La Hoya told TMZ he had plans to resume training in January, but it seems as though he’s had a change of heart. De La Hoya and Sonders, 34, were first romantically linked last August, after TMZ published photos of the pair leaving a dinner date at Nobu in Malibu. They met at a boxing event, where Sonders was a host in June 2021. De La Hoya and Sonders got together after she split from her ex-fiancé, sports betting consultant Dave Oancea, also known as “Vegas Dave.” In an exclusive interview with The Post last February, Sonders said she was inspired to rebrand herself “once things kind of ended with Dave.”
