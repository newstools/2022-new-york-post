Winters in New York can sometimes feel endless. In February, it’s hard to imagine blooming flowers, 65 degree temps and spring picnics will ever reemerge — but they always do. Ahead of spring, Away Travel is re-releasing their coveted, limited-edition lavender color and while there may be snow on the ground right now, we certainly won’t complain! Not only is it the perfect hue for spring and summer but this new collection would make a great Valentine’s Day gift, too. Since its initial limited release in July 2018, according to the brand, Away has received hundreds of inquiries from its community requesting they bring the pastel shade back. They listened to their loyal customers, and now you can purchase a variety of Away items in lavender, starting Tuesday, Feb. 8 at 1 p.m. EST. If you don’t get your hands on the suitcase you want right away, keep an eye out throughout the month, as the brand will be following up with other drops — including two of the brand’s best-selling accessories: The Insider Packing Cubes and The Hanging Toiletry Bag in lavender, too. The limited-edition lavender collection includes the brand’s classic polycarbonate luggage available in Away’s four original sizes (The Carry-On, The Bigger Carry-On, The Medium, and The Large) all reimagined in the gorgeous purple shade. Away’s lavender polycarbonate luggage will be available for purchase exclusively at AwayTravel.com or in-store at the brand’s 13 retail locations. If lavender is your favorite color but you’re not yet sold on Away, consider reading our standalone review! While all Away suitcase sizes are great for a variety of needs, we especially love the Away Bigger Carry-On because it can easily be used for a weekender to even a 10-day trip if you pack strategically. If you’re looking for something bigger (or smaller), the limited edition color is also available in The Carry-On, The Medium and The Large.
