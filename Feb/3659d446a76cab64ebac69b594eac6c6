A baton-wielding man was busted Tuesday after allegedly threatening a mom and her 6-year-old boy on the subway in Manhattan — because the boy accidentally kicked him, according to cops and the mother. The latest act of underground mayhem happened on the 4 train heading south on the Upper East Side around 2 p.m. when the boy, Logan, made “incidental contact,” according to cops. Charles Hodge, 67, allegedly responded by pushing the kid, cops said. “It was just the regular kick and you know, kids, they don’t stay still on the train,” the mother, Kayla McCutchen, told The Post. “I confronted him about it and he got all upset,” she added. Cops say Hodge then reached into his bag, pulled out an expandable baton and snapped, “Do you want to get hurt?” McCutchen said she was scared at first until a few good Samaritans hopped on Hodge, wrestled the nightstick from him and held him til cops arrived at the 86th Street station. Police charged Hodge with acting in a manner injurious to a child, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. “It was kind of scary … because you only see it on the news,” the mom said, adding, “as long as [Logan] was not hurt is what matters to me.” The disturbing incident comes just a day after a Brooklyn man was threatened with a hatchet while commuting on the subway. The victim told The Post Monday he was still shaken from the encounter. Over the weekend, at least seven straphangers were targeted on the subway system in a series of separate attacks.
