Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the Post’s live coverage. A brave Ukrainian woman didn’t mince words when she confronted heavily armed Russian soldiers – warning the troops they’d die if they stayed in her country. “What the f— are you doing in our land?” the woman shouted at two of the invading soldiers in Henichesk, a port city along the Sea of Azov in southern Ukraine, the US Sun reported. “Who are you?” the defiant woman is seen asking the men in footage that has gone viral. “We have exercises here. Please go this way,” a soldier responds after she asks the seemingly embarrassed men if they’re Russian. “Our discussion will lead to nothing,” one of them says before she unleashes another stream of vitriol. “You’re occupants, you’re fascists! What the f— are you doing on our land with all these guns?” the woman shouts, adding that the soldiers are “cursed,” according to the news outlet. “Take these seeds and put them in your pockets, so at least sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here,” she adds in a not-too-subtle suggestion that the invaders will lose their lives. Sunflowers are the national flower of Ukraine. The woman was praised online for her defiant stance in the face of the Russians, who on Friday were poised to take the capital of Kyiv. “The bravery is amazing! Thank you! We stand with you!” one Twitter user wrote.
