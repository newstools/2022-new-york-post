A Tony-winning actor has sold his tony Tribeca home. Nathan Lane, beloved for his roles in “The Producers” and his hilarious work on the 1996 film “The Birdcage,” has exited his triplex pad, stage left. Lane, who’s also a writer, said goodbye to the 2,757-square-foot spread at 35 North Moore St. to the tune of $4.27 million, according to city finance records filed Tuesday. He listed it for $4.65 million last June; the asking price remained constant until it entered contract less than five months later. Lane had reportedly owned the home since 1999, when he moved to New York from Los Angeles to work with the New York Theatre Workshop. It wasn’t immediately clear how much he paid for it at the time. What is for certain: the unit is quite the show-stopper. It comes with two bedrooms, 15-foot ceiling heights on the main level, a winding staircase, plenty of storage throughout — especially in the kitchen — and stunning design. William Sofield designed the condo’s interiors and even selected the furniture, though the latter reportedly wasn’t intended to be included in the sale. Listing images show neutral-tone interiors, exposed brick and arched windows. The main living area, with space for lounging and dining, has a standout wood-burning fireplace with a brick hearth and a custom stone surround. The home even had Lane’s artwork, awards and movie posters on display. One notable hanging in the master bedroom appears to be an illustration by the late Al Hirschfeld, the caricaturist best known for his work on celebrities and for hiding his daughter Nina’s name in the drawings. The upper level of the home houses the master suite. The lower level has another bedroom that can also be used as a home office or a playroom for children. Mary Ellen Cashman and Leslie Davidson of Compass shared the listing.
