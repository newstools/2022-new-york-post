The New York City Marathon will return to its pre-pandemic competition capacity of 50,000 runners this November, race organizers announced on Thursday. Celebrating its 51st anniversary on Sunday, Nov. 6, the world’s biggest marathon’s full force comeback follows last year’s reduction to 25,000 finishers thanks to COVID-19 limitations. The iconic 26.2-mile event was completely canceled for in-person runners in 2020 due to the pandemic. “Every year, runners from all over the world come to New York City because there’s no better race than the New York City Marathon,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement. “This race is the strongest proof of New York’s unrelenting spirit and determination, and we are proud to announce that, this year, we’ll be back at full capacity. With 50,000 runners competing in November, the city that never sleeps will be where champions are made.” The only time that the five-borough course was canceled was in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy devastated the city. Runners can apply for entry starting March 9 through March 23, according to the New York Road Runners. They’ll be notified on March 30 if they have been accepted through the drawing. “Last year’s marathon served as an uplifting and unifying moment for New York City’s recovery as well as a symbol of renewed hope, inspiration, and perseverance,” said Ted Metellus, the marathon’s race director. “This November, we are excited to have runners from all over the world fully return as we come together to deliver one of the best days in New York.” The course typically begins in Staten Island at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, then tracks north through Brooklyn and Queens before heading west across the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan and the Bronx before turning back toward Central Park to the finish line.
