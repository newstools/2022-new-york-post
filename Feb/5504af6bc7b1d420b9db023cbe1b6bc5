It’s a jam-packed, 11-game NBA schedule Wednesday and Kenny Ducey of The Action Network has two best bets. The first comes in the battle for New York as the Knicks are set to host the Nets at Madison Square Garden. With Brooklyn missing all of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons for this matchup, Ducey is intrigued by the Knicks’ point spread (-4). “When they’re favored, [the Knicks] are pretty good against the spread,” Ducey says. “[They are] 16-15 ATS this season, and that doesn’t sound too intriguing, but when you consider the Knicks have covered in just 44 percent of games, it’s actually a good number.” Ducey believes the Knicks are also better than their recent record indicates and expects them to do well against a Nets defense that ranks 26th over the last two weeks. Ducey’s next selection comes in Bulls vs. Kings in Chicago tonight, where he’s backing another favorite. Given the Kings’ reliance on interior scoring, Ducey expects a tough matchup for them against a solid Bulls defense. “The Bulls are ninth-best in restricted area field-goal percentage,” Ducey says. “And [the Bulls] still have the sixth-best offense over the last two weeks.” For those reasons, Ducey says to lay six points with the Bulls, who are seeking their fifth consecutive victory.
