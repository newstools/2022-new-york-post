Questions edited for clarity. What are your expectations for the Rangers at the NHL trade deadline?—Nick Gazerro and Paul Gifford MW: I expect the Rangers to be active, but a lot of the decisions are going to be based on president-general manager Chris Drury’s assessment of how close the team truly is to making a run at the Stanley Cup. Whether Drury thinks the Rangers are ready now or a season or two away is yet to be seen. His actions as the deadline approaches should be indicative of where he thinks the Rangers are.
