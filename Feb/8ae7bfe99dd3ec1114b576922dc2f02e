It’s all hands on deck for this new product launch from Our Place. Once again, the makers of the viral and beloved Always Pan have blessed us with a new kitchen gadget we didn’t know we needed and now can’t live without. The Fry Deck ($30) is here: Debuting Wednesday, Feb. 23, it’s the perfect complement to the pan or Perfect Pot when frying dumplings, chicken or anything that needs to drip and drain. “Welcome to a bold new world of frying!” the product hypes. “Get even more function from your Always Pan and Perfect Pot with the genius Fry Deck designed to drip dry golden goodies to crispy perfection. Custom-fit to your Our Place cookware, this add-on makes frying easier and less messy (goodbye, oily paper towels!). The excess oil simply drips back into the pan, while whatever you’re frying stays nice and warm on the stovetop.” We love that it fits both the Always Pan and the newer Perfect Pot, and it also matches, too. The Fry Deck currently comes in five of the aesthetically pleasing colors you already know and love  — Spice, Steam, Char, Blue Salt and Sage. With the very affordable $30 price tag, you can get enough to match each piece of Our Place cookware you own and some to gift for the home cook in your life. Attention fry cooks and home cooks alike: the new Fry Deck is here and you need to check it out. The newest gadget from Our Place is here and makes frying up tempura, dumplings, chicken and more a mess-free breeze. It attaches to the Always Pan and Perfect Pot and creates a cooling area for your fried foods, letting the grease and oil drip back into the pan, saving you paper towels, extra dishes and from oily first-bites.
