Are you trying to practice your golf swing frequently but can’t always get to the course, or even are prevented from doing so because of the weather? Now you don’t have to; you can practice your swing in the comfort of your own yard. The Callaway Home Range Practice System is designed to let you work on your golf swing wherever you want. This way, you can work on achieving that hole-in-one at any time of day and not have to dread traveling to and from the golf course. Plus it’s a good way to squeeze in a workout at home! The Home Range Practice mat has a true-turf surface that simulates the feel of real grass. With just a tap of your club, you can send one ball flying onto this convenient and portable practice net. With highly resistant rubber backing that prevents wear-and-tear, as well as ultra-durable construction, this is perfect for both the beginner golfer and pro. In this bundle you will get an 8sqft hitting net, FT launch zone hitting mat, and a pro caddie ball shagger/feeder. The Pro Caddie feeds one ball at a time so you can work on your shot at your own pace. Overall, it collects and holds up to 35 balls at a time so you won’t have to empty it very often. It’s never been easier to practice golfing in your backyard! No need to drive to the golf course, no need to worry about other people watching your swing. Less time will be spent driving and more time can be spent practicing, which makes for a happier golfer.
