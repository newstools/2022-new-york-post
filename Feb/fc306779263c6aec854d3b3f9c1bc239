Heartbreaking images emerged Sunday of some of the youngest victims killed in Russia’s war on Ukraine. Among the gut-wrenching photos from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region was a shot of paramedic Oleksandr Konovalov performing CPR in vain on a small girl brought to a city hospital after she was injured during a Russian attack on civilians. Next to her, an adult covered in blood crouches down in agony. More photos show the girl inside a Mariupol hospital, where she is surrounded by a team of adults desperately trying to save her young life. She tragically became one of the 16 children that have been killed so far in the war, said Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko, according to the Kyiv Independent. Another photo captured some survivors, including a woman shown holding her child and pet dog in her hands as they crowd into a shelter in Mariupol to avoid street fighting and the clashes happening in the city. Lyashko called the Russian troops “terrorists” for targeting civilians, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russians should be tried for committing international war crimes. Fighting continued across Ukraine over the weekend, with no clear end in sight as Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s nuclear-arms system to be put on high alert Sunday. Some of the heaviest fighting happened in the city of Kharkiv, where local Ukrainian officials declared victory Sunday.
