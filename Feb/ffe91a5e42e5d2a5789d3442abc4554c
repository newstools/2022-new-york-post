Rest easy, Rams fans – it doesn’t appear head coach Sean McVay is going anywhere. Hours after the team’s Super Bowl victory parade in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Veronika Khomyn, McVay’s fiancée, took to her Instagram Stories, where she made it clear that the 36-year-old coach isn’t calling it a career just yet. “Finally get my man back,” Khomyn captioned one video of the couple on the couch, immediately following up with, “And no. He is NOT retiring!!!” Discussions about McVay’s future have been swirling over the past few days, even before the Rams defeated the Bengals in Super Bowl 2022. Although McVay has expressed his desire to start a family, based on comments made during Wednesday’s parade, it seems he wants a shot at a Super Bowl repeat. “Run it back!” McVay said. Ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday, The Post’s Andrew Marchand reported that if McVay decided to walk away from the game, he’d be pursued by ESPN for “Monday Night Football.” Following the game, McVay was asked about the retirement chatter during a postgame appearance on NFL Network. “No,” he said. “I’m so happy for this team right now. So happy to be associated with it. We’re going to enjoy tonight. I’m not going to remember any of it.” The celebrations will continue for McVay this summer, when he and Khomyn, a luxury real estate agent, tie the knot. The couple has been engaged since 2019.
