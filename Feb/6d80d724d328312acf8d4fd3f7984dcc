An Arkansas man has been nabbed after he allegedly hit a cyclist and fled with the dead victim in his truck, authorities said. James Ray Jones, 42, allegedly struck the cyclist with his pickup truck in Fort Smith at about 8 p.m. Friday, police said. Cops were only alerted to the incident about 12 hours later when a body part was discovered close to the road. Jones was identified as the suspect after authorities reviewed surveillance video from the scene. Police said they tracked Jones down at his home and found the pickup truck parked in his backyard. The victim’s body was still in the bed of the truck, according to police. Jones was booked into the Sebastian County Jail on charges of manslaughter and leaving the scene of a crash. It wasn’t immediately clear what body part was discovered at the scene. Police said the victim had been identified but their name isn’t being released until next of kin is notified.
