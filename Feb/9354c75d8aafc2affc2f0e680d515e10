A large rescue dog mauled a volunteer to death in South Florida, according to reports. Pam Rob, 71, was working with Gladys — a three-year-old large mixed breed — when the dog snapped and attacked Thursday at the animal rescue center in Oakland Park, news station WPLG reported. “There’s always risk when you work with abused animals and Pam was well aware of it,” Robb’s wife, Angie Anobile, told the station. “It’s a tragic accident. I’m sorry it happened to the love of my life, and I’m sorry it happened to someone who could make such a difference in society.” Anobile, told the Sun-Sentinel Rob had been working with Gladys for about a month, before the dog dragged her to the ground by the arm and attacked. Gladys, who weighed more than 100 pounds, has since been put down, WPLG reported. The rescue organization — 100+ Abandoned Dogs of Everglades Florida — issued a statement saying the staff is grieving and asking for privacy. The group cares for many pit-bull-type dogs, its website shows.
