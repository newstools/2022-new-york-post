A New Zealand couple has gone viral for showing off their home’s bare necessities. Lawrence Simpson, 34, and his wife, Clarissa Turner, 29, took a creative, casual and cheeky approach to selling their home by posing buck naked in listing photos of their petite A-frame cottage, located in the Southern Alps’ foothills to Queenstown. New Zealand news site Stuff reported that, as of earlier this week, it had received 11,000 views on the local listing site Trade Me. “Lifestyle getaway, plus glacier views!” the couple advertised their home, for which they are currently asking $315,000 and which was first listed in September. “Gets more sun than any other property in Franz Josef.” Meanwhile, nothing is noted about the uninhibited owners appearing nude — albeit with a watering can and a book strategically placed to keep the images PG-rated. The listing further noted that the home is on 2 acres of land, has a greenhouse, rainwater tanks, solar lighting, a composting toilet and a lofted bedroom. “I’ve had a decent amount of interest,” Simpson told Stuff of the listing so far. Most of that has come from Christchurch residents seeking a vacation home, as well as individuals curious about whether the naked couple comes with the property. (They do not.) Although their home has gone viral for having fun with photos that are often considered a chore to take, the story of the sale is actually quite unhappy. The couple was recently forced to relocate after Simpson’s work as a local guide dried up during the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s so sad,” Simpson said after COVID-19 stopped the influx of international tourists who had previously sought glacier tours through Franz Josef Glacier Guides, where he’d worked for eight years. “I’m hopeful it will come back.”
