As any parent knows, your child starting school is a daunting process. But one dad has come up with a way of keeping an eye on his daughter even when she’s not in his care. The 30-year-old dad took to TikTok to share the “hack” — which involved sewing an Apple AirTag into the tongue of one of his daughter’s shoes. Once the tag was in place, he could effectively track his little girl’s whereabouts. “When it’s your daughter’s first day of school,” he wrote on the video. But the trick divided opinion among those commenting on the video. “Black mirror,” someone wrote, referring to the TV show which explores the downsides of technology. “ummmmmmmmm. right,” another person commented. However, others insisted he had the right idea with the AirTag hack. “I have an AirTag on both my kids,” one wrote. “Especially now one of them is walking back from school without me.” “this is a brilliant idea! Xx,” someone else added. “Yes lad, someone cares,” another person commented. While the trick might give some people peace of mind, it doesn’t come cheap though – they cost $39 each from the Apple store.
