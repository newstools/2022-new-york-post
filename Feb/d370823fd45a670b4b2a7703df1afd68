A man was socked in the face by a mugger who swiped his cash on a Manhattan train early Tuesday, cops said. The straphanger was on a northbound 1 train at West 28th Street and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea around 5 a.m. when the suspect suddenly punched him and stole an undetermined amount of cash, authorities said. The victim was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The suspect, who appeared to be in his 40s, fled on foot. The incident follows a violent weekend on the rails — including a man threatened with a hatchet in Brooklyn and another woman who was struck with a metal pole in the Bronx. The disturbing crime trend underground comes as Mayor Eric Adams kicks off his crackdown on homelessness and rule-breaking on the rails.
