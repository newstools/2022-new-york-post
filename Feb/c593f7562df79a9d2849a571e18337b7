Two very familiar teams in Virginia and Virginia Tech are meeting for the second time this season in a rivalry game with massive NCAA Tournament bubble implications. I expect this game to be played mostly in the half-court, as that is both programs’ identities. Neither offense attempts for offensive rebounds much, both prioritize defensive rebounding and making teams play in the half-court as opposed to letting them out in transition. And even if both teams did want to push tempo at any point, both Va. Tech and Virginia are veteran teams with experienced backcourts that really don’t turn the ball over frequently. The two teams have met four times in the regular season since Mike Young became the head coach in Blacksburg, and only one game has had over 60 possessions. Assuming we’re getting less than 60 possessions in this game is a pretty safe proposition, even if one side gets a lead and the other is forced to go a bit faster. Throw in that neither team draws fouls or gets to the line often, and it’s very hard for this game to get past 119 points without excellent shooting days from the perimeter for both teams. Pick: Under 119 or better
