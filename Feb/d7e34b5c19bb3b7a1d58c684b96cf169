They say crime doesn’t pay but Simon Leviev could soon be swiping right on a vast fortune. The convicted fraudster — who is the subject of the Netflix documentary “The Tinder Swindler” — is allegedly eager to cash in on his newfound notoriety, setting his sights on Hollywood. According to TMZ, Leviev, 31, has signed with LA-based manager Gina Rodriguez, who reps a range of reality stars, including Mama June. The pair have purportedly discussed “a bunch of plans to parlay Leviev’s new Netflix fame into profit and an entertainment career.” The Post has reached out to Rodriguez for comment. Leviev — who is accused of conning women out of millions of dollars after matching with them on Tinder — reportedly wants to star in his own dating show where “women compete for his love.” Another possible project is a podcast on which the love rat will share his dating “dos and dont’s.” In the wake of the release of “The Tinder Swindler” last week, Leviev was banned from dating apps. He also deleted his Instagram account after the documentary become an international sensation. However, the publicity-crazed conman may have now surfaced on TikTok, according to the Independent. Some users on the app believed Leviev is posting under the handle @simon_leviev_official. The account has racked up more than 169,000 followers, but some have theorized it’s a fake account and its authenticity has not been verified. While the producers of “The Tinder Swindler” believe Leviev could have scammed up to $10 million out of his victims, he’s far from the only fraud on dating apps. Other dating app con artists swindled lovelorn Americans out of $547M in 2021, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
