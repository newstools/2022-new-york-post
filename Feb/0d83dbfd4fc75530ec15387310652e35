Everyone is giving Matthew Stafford his flowers today, but Richard Sherman says not so fast. On “Good Morning Football”, former NFL fullback Michael Robinson said Stafford is “absolutely” destined to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Sherman, who was Robinson’s teammate for several seasons on the Seahawks, vigorously disagreed. “[T]he HOF bar is incredibly low now,” Sherman tweeted. “Like a participation trophy. No all decade team. No All pro. No MVP. 1 Pro bowl. Not even MVP of the SB. Never considered the best in any year he played. At least Matt Ryan has an MVP.” Will Brinson of CBS Sports chimed in, saying Stafford has an excellent chance to make it into Canton if he plays three or four more seasons, regardless of whether he earns All-Pro in any of those years. “How?” Sherman asked. “All Pro is a measuring stick. All Decade is a measuring stick. Those show you were considered best at your position during the time you played. If you were not in that discussion you def shouldnt be in HOF consideration.” Sherman added that Stafford will “likely” not have an All-Pro season before his career ends, and Brinson pointed out that Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees — three pretty certain Hall of Famers given their combined five Super Bowl titles — collectively only had one All-Pro nod between the three of them. The back-and-forth continued, with Sherman pointing out Brees’ Offensive Player of the Year honors, plus four second-place All-Pro finishes, and Eli Manning winning Super Bowl MVP twice. Sherman has played cornerback in the NFL for 11 years, spending part of this past season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Put this debate in your notebook and revisit about a decade from now when Stafford is eligible for enshrinement.
