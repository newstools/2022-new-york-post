Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray is reportedly feeling regretful over his social media purge of  Cardinals content. “I’ve heard talking to a whole bunch of different people that he definitely regrets that this all came out,” radio host John Gambadoro said on Arizona Sports’ “Wolf & Luke” show on Wednesday. “So I do believe that it was a mistake. I think he believes that it was a mistake that all of this came out and they’ve got to move on.” Earlier this month, the Cardinals quarterback fueled rumors of a rift with the organization when he removed all posts on Twitter and Instagram that contained mention of the team. On Monday, Murray appeared to respond to recent reports that both sides don’t see eye-to-eye in a tweet that pledged his support for his teammates and urged his will to win. A day prior, ESPN reported an anonymous source claimed the quarterback is “self-centered, immature,” and someone who points fingers. Murray has one more season left on his four-year, $35.6 million rookie contract, which carries a fifth-year team option. The third-year NFL quarterback is also up for a mega contract extension as early as this offseason. Murray, the first overall pick in 2019, threw for 3,787 yards with 24 touchdowns and 10 interceptions this past season. After leading the Cardinals to an 11-6 record, he was named to his second Pro Bowl. But Murray was hit with a reality check in his postseason debut, which ended in a disastrous loss to the Rams, 34-11, in the wild-card round. The quarterback struggled in the game, throwing for 137 yards and two interceptions.
