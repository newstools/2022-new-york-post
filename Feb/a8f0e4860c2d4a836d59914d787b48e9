Jennifer Rubell, the conceptual artist whose work ranges from painting to food performance — she is also the niece of late Studio 54 co-founder Steve Rubell — has sold her Sands Point, Long Island, mansion for its full asking price of $3.6 million, according to property records. The home first went on the market last November. Rubell bought the stunning modernist home by renowned architect Myron Goldfinger for $2.35 million in 2016. The all-white home sits high on 2.28 acres to maximize water and sunset views. Inside, its open layout translates to no walls to maximize space and volume. At 5,803 square feet, the residence features five bedrooms and 7½ bathrooms. There’s also an open eat-in kitchen, a library, a den and a home office. Outside, there’s a pool, tennis courts and private access to a public beach. The listing brokers are Maggie Keats and Jill Berman, of Douglas Elliman.
