There’s truly nothing better than jumping into bed with a new pair of sheets (freshly cleaned, of course). Although good quality bed sheets can be expensive, we do spend a good amount of time sleeping, so it’s probably worth the little bit of extra money. And if you want to wake up on the right side of the bed, you’ll definitely want to get your hands on the best sheets possible. “The right set of sheets sets the stage for your entire sleeping experience,” said Dennis Chan, Director of Retail Product for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. “When choosing your bedding, investing in durability, design and feel makes all the difference,” Chan told the New York Post. “Superior bedding will feel great against your skin and will withstand the test of time by maintaining quality night after night. Sheets should also complement your personal style. The bed is the centerpiece of your room after all!” In an effort to help you find the perfect set of sheets, we sifted through the Internet to find the most well-loved and reviewed options on the market. Our list includes brands from Brooklinen, Parachute, Boll & Branch, Amazon and more for those looking for crisp, luxurious and even budget-friendly options. Brooklinen’s bestselling Luxe Sheets have quite literally taken over the internet since the brand released the set in April 2014 — and the review count (77,000+) certainly proves that! They come in over a dozen different colors and patterns and the set includes a flat sheet, two pillowcases and one fitted sheet. “We are so in love with our new sheets. It was a bit of a splurge purchase a few months ago, but I absolutely have zero regrets!” said one reviewer. “Lightweight and cool, they [are] perfect for my husband and I that sleep hot. Adding more to my cart, now!” Parachute’s Percale Venice Sheets are another option that is well-reviewed. They’re crafted in Portugal from 100% premium, certified long-staple Egyptian cotton, which is lightweight and durable with a crisp finish that ages well. “Terrific. Study soft fabric. Great size with elastic that holds sheet in place. Love them.” said a reviewer. For a quality and budget-friendly option, consider these Amazon Basics Microfiber sheets with more than 321,000+ reviews. They come in more than 30 colors and cost less than $20 for a queen size. What more could you ask for? “I absolutely love these sheets. Seriously,” said a reviewer. “They are very soft, and actually have the feel of a silky sheet.” If you’re looking for something a bit more luxurious, Amazon sells a wide variety of sheets and bedding at many different price points. Magic Linen (a brand that even Meghan Markle is a fan of) is known for its white linen sheets, and according to reviews — you definitely don’t want to miss out on them! “These linen sheets are everything I hoped for and more,” said a reviewer. “They are beautiful in texture and appearance, and [they’re] husband and cat-approved too!” “My sister encouraged me to try linen sheets for the best sleep. I was so used to soft cotton and satin that linen sounded less than appealing. [Boy], was I wrong!” said another reviewer. “My husband and I love these sheets — they are soft, warm and light (yes, both). We will never go back to cotton.” The Bool & Branch Signature Hemmed Sheets are the brand’s bestselling, comfortable bed sheets. The signature weave is simple and made of 100% organic cotton that is spun cloud-weight and super soft. “The hype is real. I thought maybe it was just the Instagram influencers I follow that talked about how great these sheets are but no, it’s true. They are worth every penny,” said one reviewer. Many reviewers describe this set as the “best sheets ever.” The Buffy Eucalyptus sheets are another well loved set of sheets on the Internet! “I love my new eucalyptus pillowcases and sheets. They are so much softer than any other sheet that I’ve used, I don’t think I can ever go back. Highly recommend,” said one reviewer.
