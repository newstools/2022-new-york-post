A 46-year-old man was stabbed in the buttocks and eye during an attempted robbery in Queens, police said. The victim was assaulted by three men in the “mezzanine area” of the Jamaica-Van Wyck subway station shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday when they tried to rob him, police said. The victim, who was stabbed multiple times in the buttocks and once in the left eye, was taken to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition, police said. No arrests have been made in the case. The subway station — where the “E” train runs — is located on the west side of the Van Wyck Expressway.
