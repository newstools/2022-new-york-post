One student was fatally stabbed at Lincoln University on Wednesday night. The stabbing reportedly occurred during a brawl among a group of people inside a residence hall that houses over 370 students. The 21-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the Thurgood Marshall Living and Learning Center, police said. The identity of the student killed has not been released. Two other students injured in the stabbing were rushed to Delaware’s Christiana Hospital. They were treated and released from the hospital. “This is every parent’s nightmare,” Chester County District Attorney Deb Ryan told CBS Philly. “We extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones impacted as a result of this tragedy.” Lincoln University students held an on-campus vigil Thursday night to mourn the loss of their classmate. “We are deeply saddened by the incident that occurred on campus last night,” the university said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. “We take the safety of our students seriously and are working with local authorities as there is an ongoing investigation.” Lincoln University was founded in 1854 and is the “nation’s first degree-granting Historically Black College and University,” according to the school’s website. The Chester County District Attorney’s Office asked those with information on the stabbing to step forward.
