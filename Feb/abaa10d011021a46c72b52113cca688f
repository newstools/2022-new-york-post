The NASCAR offseason has ended and the Daytona 500 is upon us. Before the race gets started, PJ Walsh of The Action Network is here to share his best bets (video above). The first driver Walsh is targeting on the odds board is Christopher Bell, who has a good history at Daytona. “[Bell] had the fifth-best driver rating at Daytona last year,” Walsh explains. Bettors can find Bell, who ultimately finished 16th last year, in the 26-1 range for Sunday. The second driver Walsh is targeting is last year’s winner Michael McDowell, who he believes is a little mispriced. “[McDowell] is 60-1 to win it again this year – that’s a really good price,” Walsh says. “In the last 10 races here, he’s got nine top-15 finishes.” Since 2010, only one driver has won back-to-back Daytona 500’s, but it came in 2019 and 2020 as Denny Hamlin won two straight races.
