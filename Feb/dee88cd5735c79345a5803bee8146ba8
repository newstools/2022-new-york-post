It took a mere five weeks, 42 showings and 11 bids for a Sunny Isles penthouse triplex to sell at auction for $20.55 million. That’s more than $5 million over the minimum bid of $15 million. (The unit first listed for $25.5 million last year before selling via auction last December, and closing earlier this month.) The residence is at 19575 Collins Ave. in the Regalia building — where soccer star Lionel Messi bought the entire 9th floor for $7.3 million last year. The six-bedroom, 7½-bathroom unit was designed by architect Charles Allem of CAD International. It comes with a 1,500-square-foot main bedroom, a spa-like marble bathroom and design details like onyx, mixes of leather and lacquer, brushed limestone and lots of wood. The unit has ocean views, a 20-foot-high great room and a chandelier with 225-plus floating tubular glass pendants, according to the listing. Other fun, quirky and over-the-top details include a $100,000 bar made from a single slab of amethyst stone and a circular glass elevator. There’s also a 500-bottle, temperature-controlled wine cellar, a movie theater, game room and chef’s kitchen. In addition, the outdoor space boasts a summer kitchen, retractable roof, a private pool with a waterfall, a sky bar with lounge seating and a pool cabana. If that’s not enough, building amenities include a concierge, spa, beach, pool, private wine vault, business center and children’s playroom. There’s also a gym with a yoga studio and a library. The sellers were repped by broker Jeff Miller of ONE Sotheby’s International Realty and Concierge Auctions. The buyer was repped by Mark Pordes and Adam Kaufman of Pordes Residential.
