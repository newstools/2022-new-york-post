Two prosecutors heading the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office’s probe into the Trump Organization called it quits on Wednesday – throwing the case into question. The resignations of Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne were first reported by The New York Times. A source confirmed to The Post that the prosecutors jointly stepped down. The source stressed that the coordinated nature of the departures was a sign of intense frustration with the direction of the case. According to the Times, the move came after District Attorney Alvin Bragg suggested to the attorneys that he had doubts about the case. The investigation into former President Donald Trump was launched in 2018 under ex-DA Cyrus Vance, who charged the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg with tax fraud last June. Vance convened another grand jury before Bragg took over in January. Prosecutors had been questioning witnesses before the grand jury until about a month ago, essentially stopping the investigation, according to the Times. Without Pomerantz and Dunne there to steer the probe, its future is uncertain. Criminal defense attorney Ron Fischetti, who represents the Trump Organization, told The Post he saw the resignations coming and was “happy” with the development, while maintaining his clients’ innocence. He said there was “no investigation” without Pomerantz and Dunne, adding that the resignations were a sign that Bragg could soon close the case.
