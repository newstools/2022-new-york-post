A Bronx man was sentenced Friday to 19 years in prison for a fatal shooting inside a Brooklyn barbershop nearly four years ago, officials said. Trafarrah Smith, 38, was sentenced by Bronx Supreme Court Justice James McCarty after pleading guilty to first-degree manslaughter last month, according to the Bronx District Attorney’s Office. Smith shot Kevin Higgins, 40, in the torso and leg around 8 p.m. on April 17, 2018, inside the Ambience Unisex Salon on White Plains Road in Williamsburg, the DA’s office said. Higgins collapsed in the street after dragging himself out of the barbershop and later died at Montefiore Medical Center. Smith was arrested across the street shortly after.
