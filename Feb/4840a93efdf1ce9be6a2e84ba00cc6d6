Paige VanZant and husband Austin Vanderford are up to their old tricks again — sort of. Taking to Instagram on Monday, the couple — known for their nude, at-home photoshoots while in quarantine — posed for a series of outdoor shots, bundling up in the process, however. “Your fave cringy [sic] couple,” VanZant captioned the snapshots. In Monday’s post, VanZant is seen kissing Vanderford in one photo, while backing up to him in another. The Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship star, 27, also struck a pose solo in some images. VanZant geotagged Dublin, Ireland, in her recent post, which is the location of Vanderford’s upcoming fight Friday against Gegard Mousasi. “Coming for all the gold,” VanZant wrote alongside a black-and-white photo of Vanderford on Sunday. In the meantime, VanZant and Vanderford appear to be taking in everything Dublin has to offer. During the day Monday, VanZant posted cozy photos with Vanderford on her Instagram Stories as they strolled about the city. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, VanZant and Vanderford shared different kinds of photos with their Instagram followers. While laying low at home, the couple would pose naked around the house, whether in the kitchen or in the garage working out. In a previous interview with “Morning Kombat,” VanZant explained that the shoots weren’t “planned.” “We’re like, ‘All right, we’re not leaving our house,’ and, as husbands and wives do, we’re just naked and walking around our house, doing our thing,” she said in January 2021. VanZant, who has been married to Vanderford since 2018, later added how “it took a lot of convincing” on her end to keep the naked photos rolling. “It was just supposed to be fun, it was such a dark time at the beginning of all this coronavirus, the pandemic, and trying to have fun,” she said.
