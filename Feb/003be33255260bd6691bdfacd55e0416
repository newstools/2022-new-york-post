Joe Burrow is once again giving new meaning to Sunday best. In the hours leading up to Super Bowl 2022, the Bengals quarterback, 25, arrived at SoFi Stadium in a striped black and gray suit which he paired with Nike sneakers, a black hat and his signature shades. Burrow, who is playing in his first-ever Super Bowl, naturally set Twitter ablaze with his game-day look. “Arriving like a boss,” one fan tweeted, while another replied, “I freakin love it!!!” Elsewhere on Instagram, Bengals proudly proclaimed “Joeee BRRR” as others dropped fire emojis. Burrow’s style has been one of the biggest storylines throughout the 2021 NFL season, with the former first-overall pick rocking rimless shades in postgame press conferences and Joe Namath-eque winter coats. For the AFC Championship game against the Chiefs two weeks ago, in which the Bengals punched their ticket to the Super Bowl for the first time in 33 years, Burrow sported a dazzling “JB9” chain with a black turtleneck. He told reporters after the 27-24 overtime win that the stones in his necklace were very much real.  “They’re definitely real,” Burrow said of the diamonds in January. “I make too much money to have fake ones, so, these are real.” Burrow inked a four-year, $36.1 million contract with the Bengals after Cincinnati drafted him with the No. 1 pick in 2020. With a Super Bowl win Sunday over the Rams, he could potentially add another icy accessory to his already stacked collection.
