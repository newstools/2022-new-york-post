The Valentine’s Day news cycle is not over yet. Oscar De La Hoya purchased a red Ferrari SF90 Stradale for his girlfriend, sports media personality Holly Sonders. Sonders, a former host for Fox Sports, was enormously excited about the gift. In a video shared by TMZ, Sonders said she had thought her boyfriend had forgotten Valentine’s Day, but then the “late-night delivery” came through — her dream automobile. The car starts at $625,000 and Sonders, 34, told TMZ that this model is worth $1 million. The 49-year-old De La Hoya, now a fight promoter, won 11 different title belts in six different weight classes in boxing career that spanned from 1992 through 2008. He also won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. De La Hoya and Sonders first became public as a couple last August, and in November Sonders unveiled a massive back tattoo of her boyfriend.
