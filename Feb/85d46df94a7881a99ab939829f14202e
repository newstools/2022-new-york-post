An 11-year-old non-verbal autistic boy was beaten up at school by a fellow student as staffers watched and didn’t intervene, disturbing video shows. The video, obtained by KHOU, shows the boy, identified as Sekai, getting thrown to the floor by a much larger special needs student after he appears to bump him into a line at Jones Middle School in Humble, Texas. After Sekai — who has the intellectual capacity of a 4- or 5-year-old — gets up, the student punches him to the floor again and repeatedly kicks him as he crawls along, the clip shows. At least one adult can be seen in the troubling footage looking on. At one point, the school staffer taps the student on the shoulder, but the boy continues to kick Sekai without the adult intervening. Three school aides were actually present at the time, according to KPRC, but none of them stepped in to stop the assault. The distressing incident occurred on Jan. 25 but has come to light now after Sekai’s grandmother, Veda Cavitt, decided to make the video public. “Those adults in that video stood there. They did not attempt to help my child get up off the ground. They did not offer him any assistance. They didn’t even check to see if he was injured,” Cavitt, who has custody of Sekai after both his parents passed, told KHOU. Cavitt and advocates called on Aldine Independent School District to fire the aides. “How can other special needs mothers send their children back to this school knowing the same paraprofessionals are standing in the same classrooms,” advocate Quanell X told KHOU. In a statement Thursday, the school district announced the three school aides were let go. “This incident should have never occurred,” Aldine ISD said in a statement. “The district trains paraprofessionals in nonviolent crisis intervention techniques at the beginning of each school year, and will reinforce that training during the remainder of this year.”
