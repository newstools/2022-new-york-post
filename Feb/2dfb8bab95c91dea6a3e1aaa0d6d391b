The Cross Island Parkway is acting odd. It is inviting and agreeable, as if meeting its future in-laws for the first time. Even the Cross Bronx is tolerable, more bratty brother than evil stepsister. The navigation system is decoration, strangely superfluous during the rush-hour drive from Long Island to Washington Heights. Elliot Steinmetz arrives in plenty of time for Yeshiva’s weeknight tip-off. One month after the Maccabees’ 50-game win streak — the second-longest in Division III history — was snapped, Yeshiva returned from its lengthy winter break still looking like a national title contender, winning back-to-back games by a total of 68 points. On this Tuesday in February, the No. 6 team in the nation leads wire-to-wire — seizing an early 21-point lead over the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy — and NBA hopeful Ryan Turell becomes the school’s all-time leading scorer, but Steinmetz isn’t pleased.
