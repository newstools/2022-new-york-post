Chilling symbols are popping up on potential prime Russian attack targets in Ukraine — the work of Kremlin saboteurs, according to Ukrainian authorities and photos. Ukrainian officials are now urging residents to be on the lookout for the symbols, including bright red X-marks-the-spot ones, everywhere from residential high-rise rooftops to gas pipes. Authorities are also asking locals to keep vigilant about suspicious characters poking around their towns who may be leaving the aerial clues for their Russian cohorts. “The city authorities are asking the residents of high-rise buildings, who have access to the roof access, to urgently check the roofs for signs,’’ the city of Kyiv, the country’s capital, recently wrote in a Facebook posting. “If any marks are found, please cover them with earth or cover them with something.” The mayor of the western town of Rivne, Alexander Tretyak, echoed the concerns in his own missive on the social-media site. “URGENT ANNOUNCEMENT! I ask the heads of condominiums to close all attics. If you or the occupants of the house notice in the entrance, on the roof, near the houses of unknown persons, the mark of the label – immediately inform law enforcement,’’ Tretyak said. “URGENTLY inspect your roofs, in case you find marks, paint them and close the access to the roofs.’’ A Kyiv resident said many people in her city are heeding the call to try to weed out infiltrators and quickly cover up the symbols. “Many people are walking around the streets, even children, looking for these marks,’’ Anastasia Russo, 25, told the Australian Associated Press. “We are doing everything we can to cover them.’’
