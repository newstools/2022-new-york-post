Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey were feeling the love from each other — as well as one of their biggest supporters — on Valentine’s Day. On Monday, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, 29, posted a pair of black and white photos to Instagram that featured her in a bikini kissing “best friend” McCaffrey, 25. “My best friend,” Culpo, 29, captioned the post, “happy Valentine’s Day baby.” The Panthers running back also posted a Valentine’s Day tribute to Culpo on Instagram, which didn’t go unnoticed by his mother, Lisa McCaffrey. “Get a room.  Love you two,” she wrote. Culpo and McCaffrey have been together for more than two years. Recently, the pair joined her sister, model Sophia Culpo, and her boyfriend, Jets receiver Braxton Berrios, for a trip to Mexico, where they kicked off their offseason. McCaffrey’s fifth NFL season came to an early close in November, when he was shut down for the season due to an ankle injury. Although McCaffrey signed a four-year extension with the Panthers in April 2020, a report emerged in January that the team is willing to “listen to offers” for the Pro Bowler. In the meantime, it seems McCaffrey and Culpo are enjoying their quality time together.
