A Long Island dentist was arrested Wednesday after allegedly storing a cache of “ghost guns” inside his home that also served as his dental practice, police said. Officers were called to Paul Carey’s Massapequa residence after his 33-year-old secretary told authorities she saw him wielding a gun on the second-floor of the home, according to Nassau police. “While he appeared to be agitated and intoxicated, he went upstairs and his secretary heard him racking a shotgun,” Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said at a Thursday press conference, according to ABC 7. “She ran out of the house. called 911. We responded,” the commissioner said. Police took Carey, 62, into custody, then raided his home. In the basement, police said they found 20 illegal long guns, 18 of which were “ghost guns,” which are untraceable, privately made firearms fashioned out of parts usually purchased online. Over 60 high capacity magazines and roughly 3,000 rounds of ammunition were also recovered, according to cops. Investigators believe Carey assembled the “ghost guns” inside the basement. The dentist was charged with several counts of criminal possession of a weapon. Years earlier, Carey was licensed to carry a pistol. But his license was revoked in December 2012 when he was charged with reckless endangerment after authorities said he fired off rounds in his backyard, according to ABC 7.
