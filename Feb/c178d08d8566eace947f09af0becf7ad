Actor Sean Penn, who is in Ukraine filming a documentary about Russia’s invasion, called the military move a ‘”brutal mistake” late Friday and said that the Ukrainian people are “heroic.” “Already a brutal mistake of lives taken and hearts broken, and if he doesn’t relent, I believe Mr. Putin will have made a most horrible mistake for all of humankind,” Penn told the Post in a statement . “President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people have risen as historic symbols of courage and principle. Ukraine is the tip of the spear for the democratic embrace of dreams. If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost.” Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the Post’s live coverage. Penn met earlier in the week with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials and has attended press briefings as he works on the doc. Vice Studios told the Post it’s collaborating with the Oscar winner, who first made a trip to Ukraine in November. In prior years, Penn has worked on documentaries about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and druglord El Chapo.
