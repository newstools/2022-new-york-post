A 14-year-old girl in Louisiana has been arrested after she tried to hire a hitman to kill her ex-boyfriend on Valentine’s Day, authorities said. Police said the teen’s attempts to order the hit on her 14-year-old ex were thwarted by authorities Tuesday after she made the request through a fake website, 4WWL reported. The girl, whose name hasn’t been released because of her age, was taken into custody after the administrator of the satirical site RentAHitman.com alerted authorities. The teen was booked into East Baton Rouge Juvenile Detention Center on a solicitation for murder charge. “My client is a juvenile first of all. In order to carry out any crime, you have to have the wherewithal to make it happen,” the girl’s lawyer, Michael Nunnery, told the outlet. “This is a 14-year-old, she doesn’t have $5 to pay a hitman.” The homepage of the fake hitman website features a button that reads: “Got Issues? Click Here.” It takes users to a service request form that asks for the user’s full name, birthday and contact information.
