A missing Nevada woman found clinging to a tree on a steep slope was pulled to safety in a rescue that authorities are calling a “miracle,” according to reports. Gayle Stewart, 64, who was reported missing two hours after leaving her Reno home about 8 a.m., was found by her son’s friend dangling 300 to 400 feet off the road on Monday, KOLO-TV reported. “Actually kind of a miracle story,” Seth Williams, battalion chief for the Reno Fire Department, told the outlet. “The son called up some friends to start searching for her and one of the boys just decided to head off this cliff thinking maybe she fell down there and found her clinging to a tree,” he said. “He said the last thing she said was ‘help’ and then didn’t talk anymore,” Williams added. A rescue team comprising almost 30 people used a rope system to pull the woman to safety shortly before 10 p.m., according to KOLO. “That’s what I told the young man that found her, I said that’s truly a lifesaver,” Williams said. “With the rain and the snow coming tonight she’s already been exposed for the better part of 12 hours. It could have been a very different outcome had he not found her when he did,” he told the station. Stewart was taken to an area hospital for treatment and is expected to make a full recovery.
