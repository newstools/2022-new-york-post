Two straphangers were bloodied in violent subway incidents in Manhattan on Sunday, cops said. A 34-year-old man was standing on a southbound F subway at the 14th Street-Union Square station around 4:30 p.m. when a stranger struck him in the face, cops said. The victim suffered a cut to the right side of his face and was treated at the scene by emergency workers, police said. The man who struck him took off on foot. It wasn’t clear what preceded the attack or if a weapon was used, cops said. A few hours later, a 28-year-old man was cut on the right hand while walking in a stairwell at the West 4th Street station as he transferred to a D train around 8:30 p.m., according to cops. He refused medical attention on the scene and no further details were available, cops said.
