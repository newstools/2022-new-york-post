The United States would impose devastating consequences on Russia if it invades Ukraine, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed Saturday. “Let me be clear, I can say with absolute certainty if Russia further invades Ukrainethe United States, together with our Allies and partners, will impose significant, and unprecedented economic costs,” Harris said during her speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. “We have prepared economic measures that will be swift, severe, and united,” she added. “The imposition of these sweeping and coordinated measures will inflict great damage on those who must be held accountable.” Export controls and sanctions on “key industries” would be on the table, Harris said, adding individuals “who are complicit” and who “aid and abet” any potential invasion would also be targeted. The speech was attended by a variety of US and international notables including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, NATO Secretary Jens General Stoltenberg and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 150,000 troops along the Ukrainian border as tensions have mounted in recent months. President Biden said Friday he was “convinced” Putin had decided to invade Ukraine. “We have reason to believe that Russian forces are planning to — intending to attack Ukraine in the coming week — in the coming days,” said Biden from the White House. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.” Should an invasion take place the US would have a bevy of painful options it could impose on Russia, including sanctions on its soon-to-be operational Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and more than a dozen major Russian banks.
