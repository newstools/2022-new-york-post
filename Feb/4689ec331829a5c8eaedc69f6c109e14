The Knicks’ decision to hire former Minnesota Timberwolves president Gersson Rosas as a front-office consultant raised some eyebrows across the NBA. Rosas, who became the first Latino to hold a top NBA executive role when he was tabbed by the Wolves to lead their front office in 2019, was fired by Minnesota’s new management group — led, in part, by Alex Rodriguez — days before training camp in late September. A report in The Athletic detailed Rosas’ “dysfunctional” tenure, where tensions ran high throughout the Wolves front office and rival executives and agents complained about the way he treated people and negotiations. Rosas had a falling-out last summer with analytics director Sachin Gupta (they previously worked together under Daryl Morey with the Rockets), and conducted what was described as a consensual affair with a staff member that made many in the organization uncomfortable.
