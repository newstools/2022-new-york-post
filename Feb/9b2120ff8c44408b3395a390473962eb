Al Michaels made it sound as if Super Bowl 2022 could be his final broadcast with longtime partner Cris Collinsworth. Michaels, whose contract with NBC expires at the conclusion of the season, introduced Collinsworth for “one final time” before Sunday’s championship game between the Rams and the Bengals. “The Bengals … get to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1988 when this man — come sliding in here for one final time — Cris Collinsworth played in that game,” Michaels said. The Post’s Andrew Marchand has reported that the 77-year-old Michaels has been targeted by Amazon for its streaming coverage beginning in 2022, and he also could end up at ESPN. Asked last week about possible retirement, however, Michaels told reporters that he’s  “not ready for any rocking chair or golf.” Michaels tied Pat Summerall on Sunday by calling play-by-play of a Super Bowl for the 11th time.
