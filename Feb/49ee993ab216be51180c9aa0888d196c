FOX Weather meteorologists are tracking an arctic front that will reinforce cold air in the Northeast and produce snow squalls for interior parts of the region through Monday. Most expected snowfall accumulations will be light, but localized heavy amounts will be possible where lake effect snow forms and mixes with snow squalls. Areas around Syracuse, New York; Watertown, New York; and Burlington, Vermont could wind up seeing the most snow, and few isolated locations could see around of foot of new powder. The snow squalls will also be accompanied by gusty winds, which meteorologists warn could temporarily reduce visibilities to less than a few hundred feet. Once the front moves through the region on Sunday, a northwesterly flow will usher in arctic air for the start of the workweek. Temperatures on Monday morning are forecast to be in the single digits for areas around the U.S.-Canadian border and southward into interior regions of the Northeast. Temperatures are expected to moderate slightly ahead of the next storm system. A weak, quick-moving system is expected to transverse across the region on Tuesday, providing another chance of snow showers.
