Ouch: The city Department of Education is bailing out schools that have hemorrhaged kids, to the tune of $323 million — so far. The pandemic exposed the system’s gaping failures, prompting mass flight from DOE schools, nearly a quarter of which lost at least 10% of enrollment as total K-12 student headcounts dropped 5.6% this last year alone. The last mayor pretended everyone would return post-COVID. But the drop is biggest for the youngest ages, with this year’s kindergarten class 14% smaller than the one two years ago. Those families have chosen something else: a charter or Catholic school (enrollment’s rising for both), a private one — or moving the whole family away. But much state and federal funding is based on enrollment, squeezing schools that are now stuck paying more teachers than they need. Hence the DOE bailouts; some 26 schools will get more than $1 million each to plug their gaps. The agency can afford it, since it’s swimming in federal relief money, with another cash bath on the way thanks to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s eagerness to please teachers unions. Which is beyond ironic, since those unions have a lot to do with the DOE failures that drove the children away.
