The PGA Tour descends upon Los Angeles this week for the Genesis Invitational, and Amanda Rose of The Action Network has two best bets (video above). Her first bet is on Italian Francesco Molinari. But rather than betting on him to win, Rose is targeting a derivative market. “Molinari’s T-8th at Riviera last year was his best finish since moving to the U.S. and making Riviera his home course,” Rose says. On the heels of a T-6th at the Farmers Insurance Open, Rose likes Molinari to produce another top-10 finish this week at around 10-1 odds. As for her second bet, Rose is looking to the outright market in the form of a major champion further down the board in Adam Scott. “[Scott] won here back in 2020 gaining an impressive 12 strokes,” Rose details. “Including his win, he has four top-10’s and is very comfortable around this track.” Bettors can find Scott around 45-1 to claim victory this weekend at Riviera Country Club.
