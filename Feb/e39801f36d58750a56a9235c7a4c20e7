Antonio Brown’s feelings toward Tom Brady continue to go from one extreme to the other, but his dislike for Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians remains the same. Three weeks after posting a hype video to celebrate his former teammate’s retirement, Brown went back to ripping Brady while referencing the controversial ending to his time in Tampa Bay this season. In an Instagram Stories post on Monday, the eccentric receiver accused the Buccaneers of trying “to hurt me intentionally” and claiming “they sent me out there knowing I was still hurt,” he wrote on top of a photo of an X-ray of his ankle. He went on to write that he was “lied” to by Brady going into the game. “Tom said he would throw it if I came to play hurt, I came,” Brown said of the team’s Week 17 win over the Jets. “He didn’t throw it, imagine being hurt, having to play through this and being lied [to].” The 33-year-old was referencing his final game with the Buccaneers. It ended with him stripping off his jersey and pads and running off the field after refusing to go back into the game when asked by Arians. Brown maintains his ankle was too injured to keep playing at MetLife Stadium that day. He was cut by Tampa Bay shortly after. “Coach said if I couldn’t run on this get the f–k out of here,” Brown wrote. “F–k all you MF” Brown flipped-flopped on his feelings toward Brady once already. Shortly after his Bucs exit he said the future Hall of Famer, who was instrumental in bringing him to Tampa Bay, was only his friend because “I’m good at football.” Two weeks later he backtracked on those comments, calling Brady “my guy” and to not get his previous words twisted.
