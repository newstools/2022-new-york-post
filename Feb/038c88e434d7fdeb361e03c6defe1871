Eli Apple is moving on from his Super Bowl 2022 struggles — and using his critics as motivation for a stronger return next season. After the Bengals cornerback was outplayed by Rams receivers in Sunday’s Super Bowl 2022 loss to L.A., he was trolled by fellow NFL players and fans on social media — so much that his mom, Annie, jumped in to defend her son on Twitter. Apple addressed the chatter about his poor play in the big game in an Instagram post on Thursday, vowing to “unleash that demon” next season. “All Glory To God For Blessing Me Immensely This Season To Share the Field With The Best Group Of Men Ive Been Around,” Apple wrote in his post. “Truly Grateful To My Teammates, Who Dey Nation, And My Coaches for Embracing Me As Family. Proud of The Rigorous Work We Put In To Make This Season A Special One. “Yall ReAwoke A Fire In Me That Will Only Make Me Stronger and Im Beyond Excited To Unleash That Demon Again to Exponential Levels On Any Opp That Lines Up Across From Me Next Season .” Apple struggled to keep up with Rams receivers on Sunday, and it cost him and his team. He was cooked by Cooper Kupp, the eventual Super Bowl MVP, who scored the game-winning touchdown on him with 1:25 remaining in the fourth quarter. NFL players including Tyreek Hill, Mecole Hardman Jr., C.J. Gardner-Johnson, Michael Thomas, Rashod Bateman, Marquise Brown and Lamar Jackson all took jabs at Apple on social media. Apple, who is known for hitting back at his critics, said last month that he hated Giants and Saints fans. The 26-year-old signed a one-year contract with Cincinnati prior to the 2021 season, so time will tell if the Bengals decide to bring him back. Apple, who was drafted 10th overall by the Giants in 2016, struggled over three seasons with New York. He went on to have stints with the Saints and Panthers.
