A social media star is offering glow-up tips to others after completing an incredible transformation on herself. Bailey Rose Spinn shared a video of her amazing makeover on her TikTok page. Over a picture of herself as a brunette child Bailey wrote: “I wonder what I’m gonna look like when I’m older.” The video then changed to showing Bailey as she looks now – blonde, slim and normally somewhat scantily-clad. “yes that is me,” she captioned the clip. “anyone want some glow up tips??” Viewers were quick to comment on the video, with one writing: “You don’t even look like the same person.” “There is no way that’s you,” another person commented. “Wait what, glow uppppp for sure,” a third person added. Others desperately asked Bailey for some makeover tips, with one writing: “I need glow up tips pls.” “Can I please have glow up tips?” someone else added. Another person wrote: “Yas girl glow up tips please I look like I just got dragged through someone’s nightmare and the acne monster chose me instead of my sister.” And another comment read: “I definitely would really like glow up tips but just remember that everyone is beautiful and amazing in their own way.” Bailey has become a big name on social media over the past few years, and now has over 10 million followers on TikTok.
