The Red Sox released minor leaguer and 2017 third-round pick Brett Netzer following a series of racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic tweets, according to multiple reports. The Boston Globe reported the Red Sox confirmed the posts were Netzer’s. Netzer, 25, targeted Red Sox executive Chaim Bloom, the LGBTQ community and black Americans, saying in one tweet: “i am a racist. i do sometimes make assumptions based on another persons [sic] race/ethnicity/culture. glad that is out of the way.” After The Athletic’s Chad Jennings reported that Netzer was being released, Netzer quote-tweeted him, agreeing that he was racist and homophobic but taking issue with the characterization of him as anti-Semitic. “[Chaim] bloom is a hypocrite and an embarrassment to any torah-following jew,” Netzer wrote. Netzer attacked Bloom for supporting Black Lives Matter and LGBT initiatives in another tweet. He also wrote that black people should “go back to their roots and start to re-establish their true black culture.” In another tweet, he called closeted transgender people rapists. Netzer, who hadn’t played a game since prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a career .263/.327/.355 slash line in the minor leagues. He was on the restricted list in 2021. Now it seems Netzer might never return to a professional baseball field.
