A woman has claimed that she managed to reverse the aging process by just using tape. Olga, 46, specializes in natural skincare and revealed her secrets in a TikTok video. Olga shared before and after photos of her transformation and explained how she did it. Sharing a photo of herself when she was 34, you could see some fine lines beginning to develop along her forehead. She then showed herself now, 12 years older, to prove her wrinkles had disappeared. Olga said many people think she has had Botox but stated she has never had the treatment done, preferring natural methods. Instead, she uses a beauty technique called taping. Olga said she uses Kinesio Tape which is specifically designed for this method. She places the tape strategically on her forehead at night and it has helped reduce her wrinkles. The method works by restricting muscle movement and improving circulation, preventing wrinkles. Olga warns you have to take the tape off carefully to ensure you don’t damage your skin by pulling at it. It is best to wear them at night but you can also wear the tape during the day. She wrote in a comment that it’s best to do it a few times a week, to begin with, to see results. After that, you can just use the tape a few times a month. Many people were impressed by the video which went viral with over two million views. One viewer wrote: “I’ve been wearing tape on my face to bed for 10 years… No forehead wrinkles yet!” “Is that all you do? You look so young!” Another user exclaimed. Other users didn’t seem as impressed by Olga’s taping method, one wrote: “Botox is way easier.” “Or just live your life… and accept some change.” Another user commented.
