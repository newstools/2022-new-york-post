It was the abandoned aquarium from hell. A French urban explorer documented her eerie journey into the bowels of a derelict Spanish aquarium, where she encountered a rotting shark, dead squid and other ghastly sights, straight out of a Jacques Cousteau night terror. Footage of the spine-tingling excursion currently boasts 4.7 million views on TikTok. “The horror. See my exploration and you will be shocked!” wrote Juliette, 24, on the description of the video, which she also uploaded to YouTube. The daring videographer, who boasts more than 735,000 followers on TikTok, told SWNS that urban exploration has been her “passion for four years.” The creepy clip shows the full-time YouTuber — who goes by “Juj’ Urbex” on her channels (the French word urbex roughly translates to “urban exploration”) — entering the window of an abandoned aquarium reportedly located in Spain. The Lyon, France, native encounters a ghoulish array of dead ocean denizens, from skeletal starfish to a massive pink squid. Perhaps most impressive is the decomposing corpse of a shark, which evoked something you’d find in the aftermath of an aquatic zombie apocalypse. “The shark is very impressive, so it definitely appeals to many,” said Juliette when asked about her video’s viral status. Alas, the metropolitan adventurer didn’t disclose the exact location of the forgotten attraction, or how it fell into such disrepair. Nonetheless, her chilling footage went viral online with one Jaws-struck gawker writing, “oh it’s so scary.” “Those poor fishes,” added another. Despite the seemingly gruesome implications of the aquatic graveyard, some commenters believed that the animals were already dead when the aquarium was operational, given the size of their enclosures. In a similar, though decidedly less grisly, discovery last month, an urban explorer in Yorkshire, England, discovered a “time capsule” in an abandoned house that had been left untouched for 19 years.
