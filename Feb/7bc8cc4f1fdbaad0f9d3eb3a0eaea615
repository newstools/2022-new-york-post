He’s the head of a short-term rental managing firm, but hopes to make this Los Angeles spread his long-term stay. Francis Davidson, the founder and CEO of Sonder, is the newly revealed owner of Pharrell Williams’ Los Angeles trophy residence, Dirt reports. The news comes on the heels of last week’s headlines, which reported that the Grammy-winning musician and producer Williams — who left the City of Angels for Miami — sold this Hollywood Hills home for $9.2 million. This gated property first came to market in May 2020 for $11.95 million. Its asking price was reduced to $9.99 million, meaning that Davidson snagged it for a deal. But Williams still got himself a good one — he bought the property for $7.14 million in 2015. Sonder is reportedly worth $1.3 billion, according to the company, after raising $550 million from venture capital funds backed by none other than Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. Located above Laurel Canyon and designed by the respected architect Hagy Belzberg, the spread offers 6,000 square feet of living space. The home is also accented with floor-to-ceiling windows, five bedrooms and a statement fireplace in the living room. Outside — this being Los Angeles — there’s an outdoor movie theater as well as a private skate park. The grounds also include a 70-foot infinity pool, a spa, decks to entertain guests and a one-bedroom for the to crash if they need to. Rayni and Branden Williams of The Beverly Hills Estates marketed the listing; Sally Forster Jones of Compass represented the buyer.
