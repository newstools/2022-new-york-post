San Franciscans voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to recall three progressives on the city school board — for reasons that resonate nationally, and especially here in New York City. Partly, it was the board’s refusal to reopen schools for in-person learning until fall 2021, even as it obsessed with renaming dozens of schools over the “problematic” status of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Dianne Feinstein (you read that right). But the main reason for the ouster of board prez Gabriela López, veep Faauuga Moliga and Alison Collins was their zealous emphasis on supposed “racial equity”: specifically, their drive to end merit-based admissions for elite Lowell HS — where Asian students are the majority. They added insult to injury, too: E.g.: Collins, who is black, tweeted in 2016 that Asian Americans used “white supremacist” thinking and were racist against black students. Then she refused to apologize, or even delete the offending posts. Outraged Asian parents organized and voted in droves: Recall support was huge in heavily Asian areas like Sunset (87% in favor), Chinatown (84%) and Richmond (84%). Parents “were fighting for what matters most — their children,” noted Mayor London Breed, who backed the recall. “The voters of this city have delivered a clear message that the school board must focus on the essentials of delivering a well-run school system above all else.” Similar ideologues here in New York are bent on destroying Gotham’s best schools in the name of “equity,” and made significant headway under the last mayor. Let all local politicians be on notice: Parents won’t put up with this pernicious nonsense.
