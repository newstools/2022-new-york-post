While it’s unknown when baseball will return to Petco Park, one person found a different — and improper — way to have some fun at the home of the Padres. With the field totally covered in dirt after the San Diego stadium hosted recent monster truck and dirt bike events, a driver was able to drive his SUV into the park for a joyride. The person made it from around the pitchers mound to along the outfield wall while being captured on video Friday morning. One of Petco Park’s workers, Ryan Carlson, captured the scene after realizing the driver did not belong and said the person started “doing doughnuts.” “After about a minute, he came to a stop, and a bunch of the grounds crew guys made their way to the car and did like a citizens’ arrest,” Carlson told the San Diego Union Tribune. “It happened peacefully, wasn’t aggressive, at least as far as I saw.” The driver, after having the way they entered the park blocked off by members of the grounds crew, was arrested and charged with felony vandalism, according to the Union Tribune. The field, which was in the process of being returned to baseball mode, has plenty of time for it to happen with MLB and its players currently in the midst of a lockout.
