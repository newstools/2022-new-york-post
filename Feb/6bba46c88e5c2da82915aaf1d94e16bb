With hours to go before MLB’s self-imposed Monday deadline to ensure Opening Day goes on as scheduled, Jameson Taillon made it clear the owners and Players Association were still far apart — and the Yankee right-hander put the blame squarely at the feet of the owners. In response to a tweet by ESPN’s Jeff Passan, which indicated “the league is willing to cancel a month’s worth of games,” Taillon fired back. “Players are used to their ‘threats,’” Taillon said. “Owners actions have made it clear all along that they have a set [number] of games where they still make profits [and] get TV money. They don’t want to play. It’s sad that these are the guys who drive the direction and ‘future’ of our amazing sport.” Taillon has been among the players attending meetings between the two sides for the past week in Jupiter, Fla., which were seen as a last-ditch effort for MLB and the MLBPA to come up with a new collective bargaining agreement after the previous deal ended in December, which led to the MLB-imposed lockout that has already delayed the start of spring training and now seems almost certain to wipe out at least part of the regular season, a potential outcome MLB commissioner Rob Manfred previously called “disastrous.”
