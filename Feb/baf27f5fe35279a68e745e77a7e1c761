News to order: The Associated Press admits it’s taken $8 million from climate activists to write about their pet issues, so it’s “assigning more than two dozen journalists across the world to cover climate issues.” If anyone had the least doubt what angle the resulting stories will take, the AP explained that it learned “that funders weren’t just being generous; they had their own goals to achieve.” Ya think? Since the AP feeds newspapers, websites and TV stations across the country and even the world, the “donors” have a great chance of getting all their money’s worth in  propaganda, even though all the resulting content is to be clearly labelled as such. Sorry: This is news-as-prostitution. Pay the media to get the coverage you want. The venerable New York Times has tapped nonprofits to fund special reporting projects, including a story about the city after Superstorm Sandy. A Ford Foundation grant enabled the Old Gray Lady to hire a disability fellow to produce stories about disabilities. In both cases, the funders wanted government action — and knew Times stories would help them get it. Those causes may seem benign, but the principle remains the same: Renting out your institutional judgment on what news to cover (and, inevitably, how to cover it) betrays your promises to your readers. Let the “donors” buy ads if they want to push their cause.
