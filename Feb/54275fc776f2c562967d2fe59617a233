President Biden was in a Delaware state of mind as invading Russian troops threatened to take control of Ukraine’s capital Saturday. Biden’s public schedule issued by The White House showed that the commander-in-chief would spend the weekend in Wilmington, as the largest war in Europe since 1945 entered its third day. The president, 79, and First Lady Jill Biden, 70, were photographed boarding a Marine One helicopter for the 100 mile jaunt home on Friday. Biden spent 28 percent of his first year as president in Delaware, drawing the ire of critics who claim his administration is not transparent about his activities away from Pennsylvania Avenue, The Post reported.
