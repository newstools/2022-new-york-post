A Ukrainian man desperately tried to block a Russian military convoy — risking his life by stepping in front of a speeding truck, intense footage shows. The clip, which circulated online Friday, purportedly showed a courageous Ukrainian citizen attempting to get in the way of a Russian convoy — in a scene reminiscent of the famed moment a protester stood in front of Chinese tanks in Tiananmen Square in 1989. “Ukrainian rushes under enemy equipment so that the occupiers do not pass,” Ukraine news outlet HB tweeted. The 28-second video begins as a woman gasps and the convoy of vehicles marked with an oversize letter “Z” barrel down a remote road. The unidentified man steps in front of one truck, prompting the vehicle to swerve out of the way to avoid hitting him, the footage shows. The footage went viral online Friday — with many linking the brave Ukrainian to “tank man” from decades earlier.
