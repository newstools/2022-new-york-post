An Iranian free-speech activist disappeared after he bashed a proposed law which would limit internet access in the country, his family said. Blogger Hossein Ronaghi had criticized the “Users Protection Bill,” which could mean international websites, like Instagram, would be blocked in Iran. Platforms like Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter are already blocked — but Iranian netizens can access such services through VPNs, or virtual private networks. Hossein had received anonymous phone calls in the days before he went missing, his brother Hassan alleged in a tweet, while also claiming the blogger had been kidnapped. Reza Ronaghi, Hossein’s father, said in an interview with foreign media that Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, held responsibility for his son’s life. With Post wires
