A limestone mansion once owned by the late entertainment mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman — the former owner of Graceland who consolidated radio stations and concert ticket sales — has sold for $7.7 million. That’s $4.3 million less that what Sillerman and his wife Laura had paid for the residence at 151 E. 72nd St. when they bought it for $12 million in 2013. The prior owner, ex-HBO CEO Richard Plepler — now founder and CEO of Eden Productions — had once listed it for $18.5 million in 2008 after buying it for $2.33 million in 2002. The five-story home, between Lexington and Third avenues, is 5,885 square feet and was built in 1920. It comes with five bedrooms and 5½ bathrooms. The entrance is through original doors from the Paramount Theater. An entrance foyer leads to a chef’s kitchen, while a double-wide staircase leads upstairs to the first floor’s entertainment spaces: a living room, wood-paneled library, formal dining room, serving kitchen with a dumbwaiter and three of seven woodburning fireplaces. The second floor boasts two main bedroom suites with ensuite marble bathrooms, woodburning fireplaces and a large planted terrace. The third and fourth floors boast a bedroom with 20-foot ceilings, a woodburning fireplace, two bathrooms — one of which has another woodburning fireplace — and two dressing rooms. Sillerman had bought Elvis Presley Enterprises from Lisa Marie Presley in 2005, but later sold it to a private equity firm. In 2017, he almost lost the home after defaulting on a $12.5 million loan, The Post reported at the time. The listing brokers are Douglas Elliman’s Caroline Holl, Michael Russell and Stephen Geller.
