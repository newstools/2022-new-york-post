Aaron Donald says he’ll return to the Rams, under two conditions. “I’m gonna enjoy the moment,” Donald said to TMZ at the team’s Super Bowl 2022 championship parade. “We bring everybody back, I’m back. Odell Beckham, Von Miller, we bring them guys back, let’s make it happen.” Both midseason acquisitions, Beckham and Miller will be free agents this offseason. They ended up playing key roles in the Super Bowl run, with Beckham having 21 playoff receptions and two touchdowns and Miller notching four postseason sacks. Miller is 32 and has expressed interest in a return to Los Angeles. Beckham is a little trickier since he is is believed to have torn the ACL in his left knee for the second time in as many seasons. Donald reportedly was on the brink of retirement if the Rams were to win the Super Bowl, which they did over the Bengals. The 30-year old has been in the league since 2014, and has reached double-digit sack totals every year since 2017. He was an All-Pro for the seventh straight season in 2021 and, needless to say, would be a huge loss for the Rams. But that’s not the first time he talked about running it back. He also did so at the podium.“We built a super team. We can bring the super team back,” Donald said at the parade. “Why not run it back? We can be world champs again.”
