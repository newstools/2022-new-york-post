Brittany Matthews and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes enjoyed a date night Monday to celebrate Valentine’s Day. The longtime couple, who got engaged in September 2020, dined out together and also posed for a trio of cozy Instagram snaps. “My forever Valentine,” Matthews gushed of Mahomes, whom she has been with since high school. Earlier in the day Monday, Matthews revealed on her Instagram Stories that Mahomes not only gifted her a gorgeous bouquet of flowers for Valentine’s Day but purchased a beautiful arrangement for their 11-month-old daughter Sterling Skye, who turns a year old this month. It’s been a busy few weeks for Matthews and Mahomes, who recently wrapped his fifth NFL season after a loss to the Bengals in January’s AFC Championship. This month, the couple jetted to Las Vegas, where the 26-year-old quarterback competed in the Pro Bowl. For this year’s Pro Bowl, Mahomes joined fellow AFC quarterbacks Justin Herbert and Mac Jones of the Chargers and Patriots, respectively, as they once again dominated the NFC. Mahomes told ESPN during the Pro Bowl that he was still coming to terms with the Chiefs falling short of a third straight Super Bowl appearance, “I’m still not over it,” Mahomes said. “I don’t think I’ll be over it until we’re playing in another Super Bowl. So I’ll use that as motivation going forward.” Fortunately for Mahomes, he and the Chiefs currently lead the Super Bowl odds for 2023, followed by the Bills and this year’s Super Bowl champs, the Rams. In the meantime, Mahomes has another major life event to prepare for: his upcoming wedding to Matthews.
