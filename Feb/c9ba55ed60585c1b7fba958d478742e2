New York City Football Club fans won’t be able to watch their team play its first “home” game of 2022 in person anywhere in the tristate area Wednesday night. The defending MLS champions will have Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles as their temporary home for the second leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Round of 16 game against Costa Rican side Santos de Guapiles. Taty Castellanos scored twice and NYCFC won the first leg 2-0 on Feb. 15 in San Jose, Costa Rica. CONCACAF rejected two local venues, NYCFC’s usual home of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field, while Red Bull Arena is unavailable due to renovations. After facing Costa Rica, NYCFC will stay in Los Angeles to play the Galaxy on Sunday in the 2022 MLS opener. Midfielder Santiago Rodriguez is out after picking up a red card against Santos, but NYCFC head coach Ronny Delia said veteran Alfredo Morales will return after missing the first leg because of a positive COVID-19 test.
