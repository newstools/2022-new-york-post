A 30-year-old woman has been arrested in connection to the slaying of her 56-year-old aunt, who was found dead in a bathtub in East Harlem, authorities said Monday. Kristie Miro, 30, who lived in a third-floor apartment on East 100th Street near Third Avenue with her aunt Ana Nieves, was arrested Sunday and charged with murder, police said. Police were conducting a wellness check around 6:15 p.m. Friday when they found Nieves, 56, fully clothed in the bathtub of her apartment, cops said. “The victim had blood on her face and contusions,” an NYPD spokesman said Saturday. The specific details of the murder and the motive remained unclear Monday. Miro originally did not want to let cops in to check on her aunt, police sources said Saturday. “The niece, she was a troubled woman. She was crazy, getting into fights and stuff,” a next-door neighbor said Saturday. “She’d come home and she’d have a busted face or something. I think the aunt was trying to get her to move out. That’s what I heard.”
