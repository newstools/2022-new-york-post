A 35-year-old straphanger was struck over the head in an unprovoked attack on a Queens subway last week, police said Sunday. Two attackers boarded the northbound R train at the 67th Avenue subway station around 9 p.m. Thursday and whacked the passenger in the head “with an unknown object causing a laceration and bleeding,” cops said in a statement. The suspects then fled the train car. EMS took the victim to Elmhurst Hospital in stable condition. He had a cut and bleeding to the head. No words were spoken during the attack, cops said. “They just roll up on this guy and hit him in the head,” a police source said. Police released photos of the two suspects on Sunday.
