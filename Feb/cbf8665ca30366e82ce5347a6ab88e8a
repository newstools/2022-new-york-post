In advance of Tuesday’s college basketball slate, Anthony Dabbundo of The Action Network is here to share a pair of best bets. The first comes in a mid-tier Big Ten conference matchup as Michigan State travels to face Iowa, which is a six-and-a-half-point favorite. For Dabbundo, he believes this matchup is a “nightmare” for the Spartans. “Iowa comes into this game the No. 1 team in the country at preventing turnovers,” Dabbundo says. “[And] Michigan State is very reliant on transition to score.” With the Spartan offense outside the top-150 in half-court offense per shot quality and due for some negative regression based on shot quality, Dabbundo is happy to lay the points with the Hawkeyes. The second contest Dabbundo is keying in on is a Big East conference matchup between UConn and Villanova, which is a two-point underdog. Even though the Huskies lost the earlier meeting this season, Dabbundo expects their interior defense to cause problems for Villanova. “UConn is top-10 in finishing at the rim defense and a top-20 unit against ball screens,” Dabbundo said. Given that’s how Villanova generates a lot of its offense, Dabbundo believes the hosts get revenge and cover its two-point spread.
