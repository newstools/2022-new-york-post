One of the best ways to make sure both your ingredients and you are safe when preparing a meal is to use separate knives for different foods. Plus, a dull blade can be just as dangerous as having a sharp blade, since using more pressure on it will result in cuts. We don’t want that! So take this as your sign to invest in separate knives and get yourself a quality knife set. This Seido Japanese Master Chef Knife Set includes 8 knives made with strong, high-carbon stainless steel. Their high-quality construction is a good balance between sharp edge retention and durability with a higher carbon content. Each knife has a sloped bolster that travels onto the blade face for better comfort and control. They also have a more acute 15° angle for a sharper cutting face. And when the time comes that your knife’s tip becomes dull, consider getting yourself a top-notch knife sharpener. This knife set scored 5 star reviews from customers and is a “best seller” on Etsy. One customer says, “The knives in this Seido 8-pc master chef knife set are so sharp! Like razor sharp! One of the things I love about these Seido knives is that each knife is really well balanced … Look at the design on those blades, they’re so unique!” In this set you’ll receive an 8″ chef knife, 8″ slicing knife, 8″ bread knife, 7″ cleaver, 7″ Santoku knife, 5″ Santoku knife, 6″ boning knife, and a .5″ paring knife, which is great for any food that requires a precise attention to detail.
