The fourth season of “Atlanta” will be the show’s last, creator Donald Glover confirmed on Thursday. Glover explained what led to the decision to shut down the five-time Emmy-award-winning show at a Television Critics Association panel ahead of the March 24 premiere for the penultimate season, according to Deadline. “To be honest, I wanted to end it at Season 2,” the 38-year-old actor, musician, writer, comedian, director and producer said. “Death is natural … When the conditions are right for something, they happen, and when the conditions aren’t right, they don’t happen. Things start to get weird … you can’t do too much. The story was always supposed to be what it was and the story, it really was us.” The former “30 Rock” writer also touched on the dynamics of the writers’ room — notably, an equal split between men and women — that led to the show’s final episodes. “It was great, all of that came out this season, and it ends perfectly,” he said. Co-stars Brian Tyree Henry (“Eternals”) and Zazie Beetz (“Deadpool”) also shared their thoughts on the wrap during the panel. “I’m glad I knew it was ending because then I could lean into the relationships knowing this was my last chance to play Van,” said Beetz, 30, who plays ex-girlfriend Van to Glover’s Earn. “I think Van changed my life. I’m glad I had the opportunity to … put [her] in the back for now.” Henry, 39, offered speculation as to what his aging rapper character Paper Boi will get up to after the show’s end. “That’s the great part of coming to an end — it’s in the ethos. It’s up there. You can imagine anything you want to,” he said. The Emmy-nominated actor also added why he thought four seasons is plenty. “You go to high school, it’s four years. You go to college, it’s four years,” he said. “This is in our own essence like a graduation.” The upcoming season of “Atlanta” takes Earn, Paper Boi, Van and Darius (Lakeith Stansfield) out of Georgia as the act tours Europe. It kicks off March 24 on FX.
