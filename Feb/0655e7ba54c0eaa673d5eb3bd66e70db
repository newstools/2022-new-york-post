NYPD detectives opened fire on a vehicle they’d just pulled over in Manhattan Tuesday in connection with a citywide robbery pattern — when the driver tried to ram the officers, police sources said. The shooting happened just after 3 p.m. at East 99th Street and Madison Avenue about a block from Central Park, cops said. Detectives with the NYPD’s Robbery Squad were trying to pull the vehicle over because they believed it was involved in a robbery spree. That’s when the driver tried to plow into them — prompting one of the detectives to fire a round as the suspect peeled off, the sources said. Police were conducting a hospital canvass to determine if anyone was shot, a police source said. The perp fled, leaving the vehicle behind, the sources said. No further details were immediately available, the NYPD said.
