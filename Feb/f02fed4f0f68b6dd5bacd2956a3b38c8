The call of coyotes carried to Secaucus. When Bear Pascoe’s NFL career began, his retirement plans were already set. He would trade a relatively spacious apartment for a property with more acreage than the Meadowlands. He would take down 450-pound steers instead of 250-pound linebackers. The former Giants tight end was raised on a ranch in the foothills of central California large enough to hold more than 9,000 football fields. It was roughly an hour from the nearest town, five miles from the nearest neighbor, three miles from the family mailbox. To be minutes from Manhattan was to be near little of significance. He was a rancher without livestock, a cowboy without a rodeo, a young bronc whose passions were out to pasture.
