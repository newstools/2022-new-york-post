Patrick Mahomes has fiancée Brittany Matthews‘ back. On Wednesday, the Chiefs quarterback watched his alma mater, Texas Tech, defeat Baylor during a casual date night with Matthews. During the game, the cameras panned to the longtime couple, with the footage naturally making its way onto the internet. Matthews, who has been a recent target of criticism, became a talking point on Twitter amongst some fans who tried to read into their interaction, which included Mahomes taking his arm away from her shoulder and her looking annoyed. The quarterback appeared to respond to the online commentary. “Man people are weird… love you babe,” Mahomes tweeted, tagging Matthews’ Twitter handle, to which she replied, “I love you.” Mahomes, 26, has been dating Matthews, a fitness trainer and co-owner of the KC Current soccer club, since they were in high school. The pair got engaged in September 2020 and will wed sometime this year. They are also parents to an 11-month-old daughter, Sterling Skye, who turns a year old this month. Matthews has been a staple at Chiefs games throughout Mahomes’ NFL career. Over the years, she has typically watched with friends Kayla Nicole and Sydni Paige, the significant other of fellow Kansas City stars, Travis Kelce and Tyrann Mathieu, respectively. During the Chiefs’ playoff run, Matthews went viral after spraying champagne from her suite at Arrowhead Stadium. In response to the backlash, Matthews announced in January that she created “Team Brittany” T-shirts with plans to donate the proceeds to a local Kansas City anti-bullying charity. “There has been quite a bit of buzz this week and it’s been a pretty rough week over here,” Matthews said in her Instagram Stories at the time. “However, me and my team have decided to try to turn this buzz into something and something good for the Kansas City community.”
