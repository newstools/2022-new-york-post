A 31-year-old man was stabbed while riding a subway train through lower Manhattan on Sunday night, police and sources said. The victim was knifed twice in the arm by a male suspect during an unprovoked attack aboard a downtown 6 Train approaching the Canal Street station at about 6:10 p.m., according to police. The attacker stayed on the train as it headed to the next station. Police said the victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. No arrests were immediately made on Sunday night. The suspect, believed to be in his 30s, was wearing a colorful vest over a gray hoodie during the attack. Sunday’s violence in the city’s public transit system came after two men were slashed at separate Manhattan subway stations less than 30 minutes apart on Saturday night.
