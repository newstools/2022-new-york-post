Emmy Award-winning actor Camryn Manheim is starring on NBC’s “Law & Order” revival as Lt. Kate Dixon — and she’s also been spotted house hunting recently on the streets of New York. Best known for her roles on “The Practice” and “Ghost Whisperer,” Manheim said she has come “full circle,” as her first acting job out of school was a guest appearance on the first 13 episodes of “Law & Order” three decades ago, according to Deadline. Manheim returned in guest roles for seasons three and four. One residence Manheim recently toured was a $5.99 million penthouse in Hudson Square. The full-floor unit is at 219 Hudson St., known as the Riverview. At 2,011 square feet, it comes with three bedrooms, 3½ baths and a 475-square-foot terrace. There’s also an open chef’s kitchen, a windowed home office, hardwood floors, a washer/dryer and ceilings that are close to 11 feet high. The 14-unit, 10-story building was completed last year and designed by Rawlings Architects. Maintenance fees are $1,963 a month. Building amenities include a gym, a “virtual” doorman and storage for purchase. The listing brokers are Douglas Elliman’s Tom Postilio and Mickey Conlon.
