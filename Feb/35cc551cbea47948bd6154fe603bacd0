Attorney General Letitia James declared Thursday that she “will not bow” to attacks by ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo on her investigation into the sexual harassment allegations that forced him from office. In a speech at the state Democratic Committee’s Nominating Convention in Manhattan, James accused Cuomo of “disgracefully attacking anyone in his path, pushing others down in order to prop himself up.” “But I will not bow,” she said. James said her probe, conducted by outside lawyers, “revealed a dangerous pattern of bullying and harassment by the former governor.” She also noted that Cuomo — whom she never identified by name — was facing impeachment when he quit in disgrace a week after she released a bombshell Aug. 3 report that accused him of sexually harassing 11 women, including nine current or former state workers. “It has now become clear that the former governor will never accept any version of these events other than his own,” she said. “The [Assembly] Judiciary Committee and five district attorneys all read the report and [heard from] the brave woman who stepped forward and found them credible.” James is seeking re-election after abandoning a short-lived campaign for governor in December. Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing and accused James of conducting a politically motivated investigation of him. He avoided prosecution following criminal probes of the various allegations in her report, with several DAs saying the accusations were “credible” but either didn’t violate the state penal law or couldn’t be proven in court. Last week, Cuomo’s defense lawyer said that Cuomo, who’s been lying low since resigning, would speak publicly about the scandal “relatively soon.” “He will not let this go,” lawyer Rita Glavin said. Cuomo’s spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, called James “a serial liar who continues to dodge answering a single substantive question about her sham report” and challenged her to “defend her report in a public forum.”
