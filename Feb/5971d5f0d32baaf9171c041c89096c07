Slack and Amazon Web Services experienced widespread outages on Tuesday morning, interrupting communication and work after the holiday weekend. Down Detector, a site that tracks service outages, noted a spike in reported issues for Slack and Amazon Web Services beginning just before 9 a.m. ET. Coding platform Github also appeared to be having problems. It’s still unclear what’s causing the outages. Slack users were unable to load the platform or exchange messages. Slack acknowledged ongoing issues in a status update posted on its website. “We’re investigating the issue where Slack is not loading for some users. We’re looking into the cause and will provide more information as soon as it’s available,” Slack said in the update at 9:25 a.m. ET. Slack later said it was “still working towards a full resolution” of the issue. Amazon Web Services and Github have yet to comment on the situation. AWS experienced multiple widespread outages in December. This is a breaking story. Check back for updates.
