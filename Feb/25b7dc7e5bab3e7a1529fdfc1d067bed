Oh, soot! A San Diego woman tried to gain entry to her home through the chimney — but became trapped upside-down and had to be rescued, authorities said. The 30-year-old woman, whose identity was not released, was trapped for more than an hour in the chimney of a Paradise Hills neighborhood home before she was freed by authorities on Sunday, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. “When we had crews first arrive at scene, we did confirm that she was stuck headfirst with her feet up in the chimney, about midway down,” Fire-Rescue Battalion Chief Tommy Charpentier told OnScene.TV. “Her head was approximately 6 feet off the ground and she was 8 or 10 feet from the top of the chimney,” he told the outlet. Fire officials said the woman had been in a fight with her family when she took the unorthodox approach to get into the home, OnScene.TV reported. It took first responders about 30 minutes to remove the woman, who was taken to a local hospital, Fox 5 San Diego reported. The fire official said some of the challenges faced by his crews were to ensure that the victim’s condition didn’t worsen during the ordeal. “We had crews inside that were attempting to breach the wall to access her, as well as crews go to the roof of the house and use a tripod and a rope and a winch system,” Charpentier continued. “And that’s how we ended up getting her out, pulling her up out the top of the chimney and then putting her into a basket to bring her safely down off the roof,” he added.
