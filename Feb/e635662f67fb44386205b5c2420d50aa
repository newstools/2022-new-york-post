The “Tinder Swindler” — who allegedly conned desperate women out of millions by posing as a billionaire diamond heir on the dating app — insisted in his first interview that the allegations are “completely made up.” “I was just a single guy that wanted to meet some girls on Tinder,” Simon Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Hayut, told “Inside Edition” in a to-be-aired interview. “I am not a Tinder swindler.” A Netflix documentary released Feb. 2 fingered him as an international swindler, who tricked at least a dozen women — and identified him as a convicted Israeli fraudster. “They present it as a documentary but in truth, it’s like a complete made-up movie,” he told EW. His two-part “Inside Edition” interview will air on Monday and Tuesday. Following the release of “The Tinder Swindler” documentary, Leviev was banned from dating apps. But the alleged scammer — who has since signed a Hollywood agent — appeared with a new gal pal in the interview saying: “I’m the biggest gentleman in the world.”
