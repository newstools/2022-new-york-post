The NBA leans into its drama – and it’s hard to imagine a team surrounded by more drama and wild storylines over the proverbial second half of the season than the Nets.

Will Kyrie Irving ever play at home? How is Ben Simmons’ headspace? Does Joe Harris need another surgery? Can the Nets ever get whole? First things first. The Nets’ title chase revolves around Durant. His presence doesn’t guarantee championships, but it comes pretty close to ensuring contention and relevance. He’s the best player on the planet. He’s simply that good.
