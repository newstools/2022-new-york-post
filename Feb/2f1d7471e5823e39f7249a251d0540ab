New York City and New Jersey could see heavy rain impact the area. Western New York faces the possibility of freezing rain. The winds forced some of New York’s bridges to limit their access. The Verrazzano Bridge’s upper level was closed during the morning commute Friday morning, according to the NYC Emergency Notification system. A possible tornado passed through central Alabama on Thursday night as a severe storm toppled trees and left thousands of people without power. The twister was reported in the Birmingham suburb of Leeds, where a tree fell onto a mobile home while a couple was inside, according to news outlets. Resident Chris McClendon said he arrived home to find the tree on his neighbors’ mobile home. “I got out of the truck and I could hear the woman screaming for help,” McClendon told WBRC-TV. McClendon said he was able to help get the woman out, with the assistance of her husband. Leeds Mayor David Miller said there were reports of damage in the area, but no serious injuries were reported.
