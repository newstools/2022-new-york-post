The Nashville Predators have lost their last three games and got completely dominated in their most recent contest on Tuesday night, losing to the Washington Capitals, 4-1, on home ice. The Carolina Hurricanes, meanwhile, suffered a very tough defeat on Wednesday night when they allowed a goal in the final minute and then lost in overtime at home vs. the Florida Panthers. The Hurricanes were completely outplayed, getting outshot 31-18, and lost the expected goals battle 2.81-2.2. Carolina has been one of the best teams in the league all season, entering Thursday in second place in the Metropolitan Division with a 32-11-4 record. They have been so good offensively, currently ranking sixth by scoring 3.45 goals per game. Sebastian Aho has 21 goals and 28 assists in 44 games and Andrei Svechnikov has 20 goals and 24 assists in 44 games as well. The Hurricanes are the best defensive team in the NHL, allowing only 2.38 goals per game and holding their opponents to 28.5 shots on net. And goaltender Frederik Andersen has been incredible. Andersen is 25-7-2 with a .928 save percentage and a league’s second-best GSAx (goals saved above expected) at +24.9. This game features two of the top five goalies in the league this season in Anderson and Juuse Saros. But Carolina’s defense has set it apart while Nashville’s offense can’t seem to figure it out right now. Carolina should come out buzzing in response to its tough loss on Wednesday and I doubt Nashville will be able to match the intensity. The play: Hurricanes to win in regulation, -115 at BetMGM.
