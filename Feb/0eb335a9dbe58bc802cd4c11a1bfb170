Phil Weber is regarded as one of the NBA’s pioneering player development coaches, a position he filled over the course of a 14-year career in the NBA, including a stint as a Knicks assistant under Mike D’Antoni from 2008 to 2012. Amid a trying Knicks season, Post Sports+ recently caught up with Weber who also worked under D’Antoni with the Suns and was a coaching consultant for the Heat. In a Q&A, Weber discussed his positive outlook for the Knicks’ second half, working with Amar’e Stoudemire in Phoenix and New York and his view of Carmelo Anthony, who never hit it off with D’Antoni. Weber has penned a new book on the secrets to motivating players, “How Do You Make Them Thirsty?: A Road Map for Developing the Potential in Others.”
