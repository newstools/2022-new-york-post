Horrifying video captured the moment a woman was crushed to death by a 400-pound barbell — in front of her daughter — at a Mexico City gym. The 42-year-old mom was working out Monday at Fitness Sport in the neighborhood of Peralvillo, with a burly man seen adjusting the plates before she gets into position, the Mirror reported. But the woman loses control of the barbell, which falls and crushes her neck, killing her on the spot, according to the outlet, which cited Newsflash. The man and her daughter try to lift the enormous weight before two other people rush over to help in the futile effort to save the woman. The man can be seen laying the woman on her side as other people look on in shock. Her traumatized daughter is believed to be receiving psychological help after the tragic accident. The owner of the gym was reportedly briefly arrested in order to confirm the woman’s identity. The accident remains under investigation.
