WeWork’s boss said the real estate firm doesn’t plan to shut its business in Russia despite the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine — and noted that WeWork’s four locations in Moscow perform “incredibly well.” Asked if WeWork would have to retreat from Russia given the complicated geopolitical situation, CEO Sandeep Mathrani rejected the possibility – telling Bloomberg the company plans to stay active in Russia. “I don’t think so. Like I said, our assets do incredibly well. We hope for a resolution of the conflict and hopefully we can continue to do business in Moscow,” Mathrani said. He noted that WeWork’s small-but-healthy Moscow business generates yearly topline revenue of about $10 million. While Mathrani touted WeWork’s operations in Russia, many companies based in the US and Europe have distanced themselves from the country – or cut ties entirely – in response to the invasion. The Russian ruble tanked to record lows on Monday after the US and other nations implemented broad economic sanctions aimed at Russian banks and entities. British energy giant BP said Sunday it would exit its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft, while Germany-based Daimler Truck said it would suspend business activities in Russia in response to the war. US airline Delta said it would halt a code-sharing agreement with Russian airline Aeroflot. Meta and Google have demonetized Russian media outlets on their platforms, and Ukrainian officials are pushing Apple to bar Russia from accessing its products and services, including the App Store. Mathrani took over as WeWork’s CEO in 2020 following the department of the company’s controversial founder, Adam Neumann. The real estate company has struggled to find its footing since a disastrous bid to go public in 2019. WeWork finally went public through a SPAC merger in October 2021, though shares have slumped since its debut.
