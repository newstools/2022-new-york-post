The New York State Democratic Party nominated Kathy Hochul for governor Thursday while denying city Public Advocate Jumaane Williams the opportunity to challenge her in a primary. Hochul, the sitting governor who took the helm last August after ex-three-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned in a sexual harassment scandal, secured about 85 percent of the weighted vote at the party’s convention at the Sheraton hotel. Another candidate, attorney Paul Nichols, received 2 percent of the vote. Long Island Rep. Tom Suozzi, realizing he didn’t have support at the committee, didn’t have his name put in for nomination. Both he and Williams — who has the support of the left-wing Working Families Party and a few other progressive groups — will petition to collect the necessary number of Democratic voter signatures to qualify for access to the primary ballot. To do so, a Democratic hopeful for governor must collect 15,000 valid signatures from party voters with at least 100 signatures coming from voters in 13 congressional districts. It’s expected that Williams and Suozzi will be able to qualify for ballot access through the petition process — though it will take resources to do so. “We’ll rise up for one state,” Hochul said following her nomination.
