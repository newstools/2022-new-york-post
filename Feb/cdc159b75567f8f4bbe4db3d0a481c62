Queen Elizabeth II canceled her online engagements Tuesday due to “mild” COVID-19 symptoms, Buckingham Palace announced. “As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” a palace spokesman. She has yet to decide whether to press ahead with further engagements for this week, such as her weekly conversation with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday, officials said. Officials confirmed Sunday that the 95-year-old monarch — who has been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot — had tested positive for COVID. Her eldest son, Prince Charles, 73, and her 74-year-old daughter-in-law, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, both contracted COVID-19 earlier this month. Charles has since returned to work. There are also thought to have been several recent virus cases among the staff at Windsor Castle, where the Queen is staying. News of the positive test has sharpened concerns about the health of the world’s longest-reigning monarch two weeks after she marked 70 years on the British throne. The Queen spent a night in a London hospital for unspecified tests in October and until recently had been under doctors’ orders to rest and only undertake light duties. She canceled various major engagements late last year and only returned to public duties earlier this month. Elizabeth raised concern last week when she appeared frail and walked with a cane, admitting that she was struggling to move.
