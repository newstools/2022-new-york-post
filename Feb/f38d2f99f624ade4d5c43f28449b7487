A shipment of terminals from Elon Musk’s satellite internet service Starlink have arrived in Ukraine, according to a top Ukrainian official. Ukrianian vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov shared an image of a truckload of Starlink terminals late Monday, writing, “Starlink — here. Thanks, @elonmusk.” “You are most welcome,” the SpaceX and Tesla CEO replied.Starlink terminals receive internet from SpaceX’s 2,000 satellites, allowing users to get online even if their service has been disconnected. Fedorov first requested Musk expand the service to Ukraine through Twitter on Saturday as the Russian military laid siege to the country. “@elonmusk, while you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine!” Fedorov wrote on Saturday. “While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.” Musk replied hours later that Starlink service was now active in Ukraine and said he would send more terminals. On Monday, he appeared to have delivered on that promise. It was unclear whether Ukrainians had to pay for the terminals or for Starlink service. SpaceX currently charges $500 for a terminal and $100 a month for standard internet service. The company is adding a premium service that costs $500 per month with a $2,500 terminal. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
