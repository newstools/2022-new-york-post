‘Tis the season to be naughty. And what better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day than with sexy lingerie? Whether it’s a silky chemise, a seductive bodysuit or a lacy bra-and-panty set, strutting your stuff in flirty frillies is a surefire way to heat things up this holiday. But, if buying luxurious intimates for yourself or a partner feels overwhelming, fear not. We’ve gone to the experts: OnlyFans models. Some of the platform’s most beloved vixens offered up their top shopping tips for women of all ages, shapes and sizes. The main message: Just do it. “It’s important women feel sexy, on Valentine’s Day or any other day,” Sexxy Jaimie, 34, told The Post. Have a look. While 27-year-old beauty Erica Scott (@EnvyErica) loves flaunting her hourglass figure in satin and lace, she believes that Valentine’s Day is a great time to mix things up with bolder pieces, like this leopard print bodysuit from RomanceBoutiqueSecrets.com (similarly patterned pieces from $31.99). “Stepping out of my comfort zone helped me realize that there’s more than one way to express my sexiness,” said the Los Angeles-based mother-of-one, who pulls in roughly $35,000 per month on OnlyFans. “My suggestion to everyone is: Don’t be afraid to trying something spicy and new.” “My fans like me in lingerie,” said Monica Huldt, a 38-year-old native of Sweden now based in Scottsdale, Arizona. Huldt (@Miss_Swedish_Bella) rakes in roughly $80,000 per month posing in risqué couture, like this strappy set from HoneyBirdette.com (similar sets from $290). For Valentine’s Day, investing in a similarly elaborate ensemble is a good move. “I definitely suggest getting a full lingerie set so that your [significant other] has to take their time taking it off of you,” she said with a giggle. “It builds the anticipation and really heats things up.” After shedding 100 pounds via intermittent fasting and keto, Jaimie (@SexxyJaimie) took to OnlyFans to show off her new body. “I honestly love being on OnlyFans because I get such great feedback from my followers about how much they enjoy experiencing the real me,” said the St. Louis, Missouri, mother-of-three, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons. She said that it’s all about finding something that makes you feel sexy, like this cheeky one-piece (Roselux Women’s Sexy Deep V Neck One Piece Pajamas, from $22.89 at amazon.com). “Confidence is key. All you have to do is flaunt your best feature, and be confident in the truth that you really are beautiful.” For Pasha Pozdniakova (@MissParaskeva), a 22-year-old based in Helsinki, having a perfect fit is key, but it isn’t always easy. “For women like me, with bigger sizes [breasts], it’s almost impossible to find lingerie that fits in a regular store,” said the internet enchantress, who began modeling her natural curves on OnlyFans at age 18. So, she favors buying bras from companies that make a vast array of sizes, like Europe’s Change Lingerie. “You don’t have to be a Victoria’s Secret model in order to be sexy,” she said. “Women of all sizes are beautiful. And lingerie can make you feel sexy on a different level. So, why not treat yourself.” Hairdresser-turned-web model Stephanie Gonzalez (@SheBeStephanie), who brings in six figures with her new line of work, believes that perfection is the enemy of seduction. “Don’t be shy or timid about getting sexy for your partner on Valentine’s Day, even if you don’t feel like you have the ‘perfect body,’” said the Fresno, California-based 33-year-old. Put on something sexy, like this classic black set from SocietyVice.com (similar sets from $68) and just be you. “Your partner is already attracted to you,” Gonzalez said. “You already are the baddest b – tch to them. So treat yourself like you’re the baddest woman around.”
