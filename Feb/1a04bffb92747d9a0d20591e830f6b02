Estee Lauder ousted senior executive John Demsey on Monday over an Instagram post of a meme that contained the N-word and jokes about COVID-19. Demsey’s 31-year stint at the company comes to an end just days after he was suspended over the post, according to the Wall Street Journal. The now-deleted post was a meme that showed a mockup of a book cover featuring “Sesame Street” star Big Bird with a Photoshopped mask. Demsey’s Instagram account has over 73,000 followers. An Estee Lauder spokesman said Demsey — who was executive group president over subsidiaries including MAC and Clinique — was not technically fired but instead retired under pressure from the company. “John was not fired,” a company spokesman told The Post. “He was told he had to leave the company and agreed to retire this week.” “The decision is a result of his recent Instagram posts, which do not reflect the values of The Estée Lauder Companies, have caused widespread offense, are damaging to our efforts to drive inclusivity both inside and outside our walls, and do not reflect the judgment we expect of our leaders,” Estee Lauder said in a memo to employees. Over the weekend, Demsey posted an Instagram message apologizing for the meme. “I am terribly sorry and deeply ashamed that I hurt so many people when I made the horrible mistake of carelessly reposting a racist meme without reading it beforehand,” Demsey wrote. In the fiscal year which ended on June 30, Demsey pocketed a salary of $9.6 million. Demsey, the divorced father of a teenage boy, has been known to frequent the New York City party circuit with high-powered celebrities. Demsey graduated from both Stanford University and New York University’s Stern School of Business. He has worked in the cosmetics industry since the 1990s. He rose to become president of MAC Cosmetics in 1998 until 2006, when he was named global president for Estee Lauder.
