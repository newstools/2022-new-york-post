The American duo of Elana Meyers Taylor and Sylvia Hoffman captured bronze in the two-woman bobsled event in Beijing on Saturday night. Clocking in at 4:05.48, the duo finished behind only two German bobsleds. It’s the second medal for Meyers Taylor, 37, at the Olympics, who broke her own record for oldest American women to medal at the Winter Olympics by five days. It’s also the fifth Olympic medal of her career. Meyers Taylor, who was unable to be the flag bearer for the opening ceremony due to COVID-19, has also been picked for the same role at the closing ceremonies. The US is tied for fourth in the gold medal count for Beijing and tied for third in the overall medal count
