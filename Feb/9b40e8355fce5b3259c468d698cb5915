Haters think they can put 50 Cent to shame? Fat chance! The rapper has been mercilessly blasted with fiery fat jokes and body-shaming bombs since Sunday, when he rocked the Super Bowl halftime show with an upside-down performance of “In da Club” — the iconic hanging stunt he debuted in the 2003 video for the smash hit. Despite the 46-year-old’s ability to effortlessly execute the physical feat for fans almost two decades later, cyber critics and wannabe comedians were focused on Fiddy’s apparent weight gain. “50 cent got fat now he a dollar,” tweeted a heckler. “50 Cent out here looking like a FAT BAT,” penned another jeerer, alongside a screenshot of the “Wanksta” rhymer suspended in the air. Timeline trolls even teased the veteran rapper by backhanding him with his renowned “I love you like a fat kid loves cake” lyric from his love ballad “21 Questions.” But 50 is eating it all up. Rather than retaliating against his rude weight watchers, the “Candy Shop” crooner took advantage of the social media attention by promoting his new line of G-Unit streetwear. “Get your G-Unit Tank tops & Headbands Now,” Fiddy plastered on Twitter amid the digital fat-shame rain. The Queens native also sidestepped the shade by sharing a meme that begged him and his halftime show co-stars, Dr. Dre, 56, Mary J. Blige, 51, Snoop Dogg, 50, Eminem, 49, and Kendrick Lamar, 34, to headline a collaborative tour. And while Fiddy was making the most of the messy moment, his online supporters defended him against the chubby wisecracks. “What psychological delusion leads some to believe 50 Cent is FAT!? I don’t even give a f–k about Fifty, but this is ridiculous,” argued an ally. “People tried to clown 50 Cent during the Super Bowl saying he got fat knowing damn well most of them aren’t in the same shape they were in 20 years ago either,” said another. Representatives for 50 Cent did immediately respond to The Post’s request for a comment.
