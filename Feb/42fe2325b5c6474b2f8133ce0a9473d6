Which underdogs are worthy bets on the Thursday college basketball card? Matty Cox, Ky McKeon and Jim Root of The Action Network are here to give their selections (video above). For Cox, he’s a believer in the Temple Owls as a road underdog against Memphis. “[Temple] has been feisty,” Cox says. “And I think they’ve found something with this young freshman/sophomore nucleus.” Additionally, Cox believes the Temple backcourt has the ability to explode, a good trait to bring to Memphis. With the Tigers in a “weird” spot, Cox is taking the Owls +11.5. For Root, he’s choosing to back Montana on the road against Southern Utah. “[Montana] knocked off the Thunderbirds in Montana,” Root says. “I think they complete the season sweep.” Plus, considering Southern Utah had two miracle comebacks last season, Root believes there’s a good revenge angle to be had with the Grizzlies. Finally, McKeon is keying in on Belmont at Murray State, who are three-and-a-half point home favorites. “I don’t know the last time Belmont hasn’t beat Murray State in a year, so Murray to sweep Belmont would be a bit surprising to me,” McKeon details. Add in some questionable recent efforts from the Racers and McKeon expects Belmont to cover on the road.
