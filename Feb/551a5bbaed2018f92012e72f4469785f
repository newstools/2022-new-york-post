The Rams, in addition to quarterback Matthew Stafford and wife Kelly, will be covering the expenses of photographer Kelly Smiley, who was injured Wednesday after falling from a platform during the team’s Super Bowl 2022 victory parade. In a joint statement issued Thursday by the Rams and Staffords to People, they said they’ve “been in communication with Kelly Smiley,” since Wednesday’s incident and “are sorry” for what transpired. “As we told Kelly, we will be covering all her hospital bills and replacing her cameras. We wish her a speedy recovery,” the statement read. During Wednesday’s festivities, which honored the Rams for their Super Bowl 2022 win over the Bengals on Sunday, Smiley was seen falling backward as she appeared to take a photo of Stafford. The quarterback drew criticism on social media in response to online videos, which shows him walking away as wife Kelly appears to check on Smiley. Smiley, a photographer for Crypto.com Arena, posted a message Wednesday evening on Twitter, stating she fractured her spine. In a follow-up message posted on her Instagram Story, Smiley said she’s “feeling ok.” “Staying the night in the trauma center,” she wrote. “Thank you everyone for reaching out.” In the wake of the incident, Smiley’s friends launched a Go Fund Me page to help cover her expenses, as well as the damaged camera equipment. As of Thursday afternoon, more than $41,000 has been raised with an overall goal of $30,000.
