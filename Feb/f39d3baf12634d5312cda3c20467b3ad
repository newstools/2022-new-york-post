Alec Baldwin is saying goodbye to New York after shelling out a modest $1.75 million for a massive 55-acre property in Vermont. The move comes four months after the actor fatally shot cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins,  and injured his director with a prop gun on his now-suspended Western film “Rust” in New Mexico. He was first spotted house hunting in the Manchester area of the state in October — the same month the tragic incident took place. Because the sale of the restored three-bedroom, three-bathroom main house with several outbuildings, took place off the market, interior photos are scarce. Baldwin, 63, and his wife, Hilaria, closed on the antique farmhouse on Feb. 15, according to local reports. Spanning over 3,600 square feet, the massive property is situated in Arlington and has been pegged as a “classic Vermont 18th-century farm.” Additionally, there is a renovated 1,800-square-foot guest cottage that comes with four bedrooms and two bathrooms, a horse barn with updated stalls, several pastures and a waterfall spillway, according to the previous listing. Built in 1792, the 18th-century home also comes with a tavern room with a fireplace, a sauna and a picturesque red dairy barn. It was last sold in November 2014 for $549,000 after the home went into foreclosure, records show. Vicki Wilson of Maple Leaf Realty repped the sellers and Sean Dillon at Rhodes Real Estate repped the Baldwins. Is is unclear why the Baldwins chose to call Arlington their new home, but Hilaria’s grandfather, David Lloyd Thomas Sr., was a long-time resident of the town, with a current population of 2,457. Meanwhile, Baldwin has been privately shopping his Greenwich Village triplex he began purchasing in 2011 through 2019, worth more than $16 million, since the pandemic, The Post previously reported. Baldwin, his wife, and seven children, also maintain an 8-acre Hamptons estate. A rep for Baldwin did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.
