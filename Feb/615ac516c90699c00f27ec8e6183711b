Daryl Morey has a pair of radical ideas to shorten the NBA season. Appearing with Colin Cowherd on the “Volume Sports” network, the 76ers’ president of basketball operations documented his vision of how to make the season more concise. Cowherd suggested cutting the season from 82 games to 74, and making the first round of the playoffs best-of-five instead of the current seven. Morey raised and went all in. “You’re too timid, but you gotta go farther,” Morey said. “I like 58. Every team plays every [other] team two times. The playoffs, I 100 percent agree, shorter is better.” This is when Morey offered a truly eye-popping proposal. “I would have it one-and-done,” he said. “There’s a reason everyone tunes into every game at huge ratings in the NFL. It is literally one-and-done. And the NCAA Tournament, in 63 games, gets more money than we do in our entire regular season. “Any sport should want more games that are close to the Super Bowl. Nothing’s going to beat the Super Bowl for a little while, though I think the NBA can pass the NFL in my lifetime for sure for their biggest game being a big deal.” It is unlikely that the NBA Finals will pass the Super Bowl for ratings in Morey’s lifetime. Super Bowl 2022 drew 112.4 million viewers. The 2021 NBA Finals averaged fewer than 10 million viewers in six games. The most-watched NBA game on record, 1998’s Bulls-Jazz Game 6, drew about 36 million viewers. Shortening the NBA’s regular season dramatically would definitely be a productive idea. Injuries to stars have been mounting for years, with “load management” being an issue for the league and its fans. The one-and-done idea is fascinating, but unlikely to happen. It’s very difficult to see the NBA giving up the volume of postseason games it has with TV partners. Morey is right that it would make for titillating drama, but it would be astonishing if his idea ever came to fruition.
