Dr. Eric Huang, who spearheaded Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearly knows how to make a splash. He just plunked down $8.1 million for a West Chelsea duplex that comes with its own private pool, according to property records. (The purchase was made via Shamash 522 LLC.) That’s quite a deal, considering the seller paid $8.81 million for the property in 2018. The five-bedroom unit by the High Line was last asking $8.5 million. Moderna’s vaccine netted the company billions of dollars in revenue last year, according to reports. But don’t expect Huang to rest on his laurels. He is now steering the company’s move into gene editing, as chief scientific officer of Moderna Genomics, a new unit announced last year. The seventh-floor condo is at the Soori High Line, at 522 W. 29th St. — an 11-story boutique building developed in 2017 and known for having a private pool in every unit. Huang’s new 3,586-square-foot unit opens from a private elevator landing to a double-height living room with floor-to-ceiling windows and 18-foot ceilings. Details include oak-paneled walls, radiant heated limestone floors, a gas fireplace — plus an enclosed and heated saltwater pool, which is surrounded by timber decking. The interior also features a chef’s kitchen and a master bedroom with its own private terrace. The remaining bedrooms are on the upper floor, which also features another terrace and a media room. Building amenities include a fitness center, a lounge, storage and private parking. Listing broker Jessica Levine of Douglas Elliman declined to comment.
