The family of slain Chinatown resident Christina Yuna Lee has launched a fundraiser to “make the 35 years she spent on Earth mean something for generations to come.” Angela Yujin Lee began a GoFundMe campaign Saturday hoping to raise at least $100,000 to go to causes important to Lee. The Korean American creative producer was followed into her apartment on Feb. 13 and stabbed more than 40 times. Assamad Nash, a 25-year-old homeless man, has been charged in her murder. “Christina was full of life. She radiated positivity, joy, and love. She supported her friends in everything that they did. She went above and beyond to make those she loved know she was there for them — never expecting anything in return. Her loss is an unfathomable tragedy that her loved ones and her community will struggle with for years to come,” the appeal says. The money is to go to five organizations, including Safe Walks which, according to the appeal, matches New Yorkers who feel unsafe while commuting with travel companions. Contributions will also be distributed to the Prospect Park Alliance to support what was described at Lee’s favorite park, and to the Elizabeth Street Garden in Nolita “her personal oasis in the middle of the city.” The family said that if more than $100,000 came in it would start the Christina Yuna Lee Memorial Fund “to provide additional support to these organizations.” The campaign had raised more than $25,000 by Saturday evening.
