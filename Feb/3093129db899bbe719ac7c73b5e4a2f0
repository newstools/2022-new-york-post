As Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky seals his political legacy, his legend grows in the US and UK. British actor Hugh Bonneville, one of the stars of the hit “Paddington” movie franchise, revealed on Sunday that Zelensky, in fact, had voiced the beloved animated bear for the Ukrainian film audience. “Until today I had no idea who provided the voice of @paddingtonbear in Ukraine. Speaking for myself, thank you, President Zelenskiy. [sic] #PaddingtonBear,” wrote Bonneville, whose message on Twitter attracted more than 37,000 likes. Along with his tribute Bonneville, 58, shared a Ukrainian language promotional trailer for “Paddington 2” featuring then-actor and comedian Zelensky. “Hello to my darling friends. I, Volodymyr Zelensky, will lend my voice to the wonderful, charismatic, friendly bear Paddington,” the 44-year-old politician can be heard telling viewers in the two-minute trailer, according to a report by Variety. “Paddington’ [is a film] you can go to see with your whole family, and everyone will enjoy it regardless of your age,” he adds. “You know you will definitely walk out of the film in a fantastic mood.” It’s been previously revealed that the wartime leader was once the star of Ukrainian televisions series “Servant of the People,” in which an unsuspecting teacher is thrust into the seat of Ukraine’s presidency — a role that inspired Zelensky to run for office in real life. The former comedian and actor won Ukraine’s presidential election in 2019. The anthropomorphic bear in a raincoat was voiced by Ben Whishaw (“No Time To Die”) for English-language audiences. “Paddington” starred Bonneville, Sally Hawkins (“The Shape of Water”), Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent in 2014. “Paddington 2” again saw Bonneville and Hawkins lead while adding Hugh Grant and Imelda Staunton (“The Crown”) to the sequel lineup in 2017.
