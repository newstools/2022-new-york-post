Olympic athletes on Sunday marched into the stadium for the closing ceremony and to bid farewell to the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. The ceremony at Bird’s Nest Stadium featured the athletes who are still in Beijing after competing at the Winter Games. Like the opening ceremony, it was headed by director Zhang Yimou, who choreographed a show of dancers with tiny, fiery snowflakes gliding through the stadium. There was a modest crowd of invited guests shaking hand clappers and doing the wave. The Beijing Games forged ahead this year despite concerns about the Omicron variant of COVID-19 spreading across the globe. Athletes were subjected to strict COVID-19 protocols, including testing to get into the country, daily testing after they arrived and wearing masks except when they were competing. They had to stay within the Olympic bubble the entire time they were in China. There have only been 463 positive tests among thousands of visitors inside the bubble since Jan. 23. The International Olympic Committee also faced scrutiny for allowing a government accused of human rights violations to host the competition. Several Western governments boycotted by not sending any official delegations to represent them, though they sent athletes. On Sunday night, Chinese President XI and IOC President Thomas Bach helped hand off to Milan-Cortina, which will host the 2026 Winter Games. With Post wires
