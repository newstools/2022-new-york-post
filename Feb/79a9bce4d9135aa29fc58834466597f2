Wild new video captures the gunman who opened fire outside an East Harlem bodega over the weekend – killing a 25-year-old man. The footage, released early Monday, shows the suspect in the 11 p.m. Saturday slaying of 25-year-old Shaquell Gainey strolling on the sidewalk and then stopping short in front of the deli on First Avenue near East 116th Street, where he let off at least one round – just as someone ran inside. Then he opened fire again, directly into the bodega, the clip shows. A man standing by the door appears to duck out of the way, and then run out past the gunman, the clip shows. Gainey was struck in the chest during the fracas, cops said. He was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Cops were still searching Monday for the suspect, who is described as standing about 6 feet tall with a slim build. He was last seen wearing a black face mask, a black hooded jacket, an orange hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and orange sneakers, police said.
