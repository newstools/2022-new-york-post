One person was killed and another hurt when they were struck by subway trains in two separate incidents in Manhattan that happened within hours on Saturday night, police said. A man who was walking along the subway tracks was struck and killed by a 3-train near 50th Street, police said. Cops said the man was walking along the express track around 10:30 p.m. when he was struck by a southbound train. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Earlier, just after 9 p.m., a man was injured after he slipped and fell off the subway while moving between cars at the Canal Street station as he was riding the J-train, according to police. FDNY responded and transported the man to a local hospital for treatment where he is expected to recover, cops said. Both incidents caused delays.
