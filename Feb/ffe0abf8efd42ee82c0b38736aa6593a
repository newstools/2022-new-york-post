Before you place your wagers for Tuesday’s seven-game NBA slate, catch Munaf Manji of The Action Network sharing his best bets. Rather than targeting sides or totals tonight, Manji is focusing in on two prop markets – one player prop and one team total. In the case of the former, Manji believes Atlanta Hawks center Clint Capela could be in for a big day on the glass. “In six games without [John] Collins in the lineup…Capela is averaging close to 31 minutes a game,” Manji says. “Additionally, Capela is averaging 14.2 points but, more importantly, he’s averaging 16.2 rebounds per contest.” Seeing as the Cleveland Cavaliers are allowing close to 16 rebounds a game to opposing centers over the last seven days, Manji likes Capela over 12.5 rebounds. Manji’s second best bet of the evening comes in Grizzlies vs. Pelicans, where he’s targeting Memphis over 115.5 points. “Over the last five games, the Grizzlies are the no. 1-ranked offense in the league,” Manji explains. Because the Pelicans are allowing close to 110 points/game in its last 10 against teams with winning records, Manji expects its defense to struggle on the second night of a back-to-back.
