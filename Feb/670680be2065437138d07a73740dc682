A known Harlem drug dealer was shot and killed while sitting in a brand new Mercedes Benz in East Harlem on Sunday morning, cops said. Charles Buckner, 38, was killed and his 24-year-old nephew wounded around 8:20 a.m at 2289 Fifth Avenue when someone “shot into the car multiple times,” a police spokesman said. A bullet struck Buckner in the head and he was pronounced dead at the scene. The younger man walked into Harlem Hospital with a gunshot wound to the arm. Buckner, whose nickname was “Almighty Charles,” had 14 prior arrests, including two in 2014 for criminal possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy, police sources said. He also had weapons possession charges in 2008 and 2003. “The car is parked in front of a deli when a guy comes up from the sidewalk and fires in about six times,” a police source said. The bullet struck Buckner in the right temple, the source said. There were no immediate arrests. The early morning violence followed a fatal stabbing in Brooklyn late Saturday night, cops said. Two men who were working private security at a party were knifed while attempting to toss a “disruptive” guest from 168 7th Street around 10:45 p.m., cops said. One of the bouncers, 25, was stabbed in the chest, while the other, 21, was knifed in the back. Both victims were taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. The older security guard died, while the younger was in stable condition, cops said. A 20-year-old man was taken into custody and charges were pending.
