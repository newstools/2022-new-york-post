Lady and the tramp? A UK groom is being lambasted mercilessly online for showing up to his own nuptials in a T-shirt and faded jeans — while his blond bride is done up to the hilt in a fancy wedding dress. A clip of his fashion faux pas has racked up more than 1.7 million views on TikTok as of Wednesday morning. “Well, she’s definitely fell in love this summer,” reads the caption to frumpy footage, which was shared Sunday by Dorchester’s Violet Price, 16. In the now-viral footage, Price’s “best friend” and traveling companion Catherine Nicholson, also 16, can be seen standing at the altar while gussied up in a traditional white gown and glittering tiara. By contrast, her schlubby hubby-to-be, who isn’t named, sports dirty sneakers, washed-out jeans and a black T-shirt emblazoned with the logo “Palm Angels” for the occasion. (BTW: It’s worth noting that these tees from designer Francesco Ragazzi’s hipster streetwear brand hover in the $280 to $400 price range, and they sell at upscale stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue.) However, TikTok fashion critics were not impressed — and quickly bashed Nicholson’s “Slob” groom for dressing like a vagabond on his gal’s big day. “Did he not know he was getting married?” wondered one commenter of the couture-challenged clod. Another outraged social media fashionista fumed, “That is sad look how beautiful she looks he couldn’t even be bothered changing from the night before.” Meanwhile, one jokester wondered if the sartorially illiterate lad was “filling in for a mate.” “When ur getting married at 4 but lads night down the pub is at 6,” quipped another of the fashion Philistine. Despite the tsunami of bile, Violet Price stood by her bestie’s betrothed, fuming in the comments: “For god sake stop she’s married & very happy. She’s not bothered wat way he dressed she’s married & that’s all that matters.”
