An Asian artist was attacked on his way to perform at the opening night of a Lower Manhattan play — just blocks from where Christina Yuna Lee was killed in her apartment two weeks ago, the theater said. The unnamed performer was assaulted Wednesday night near Seward Park on the Lower East Side on his way to The Public Theater, according to a statement from the theater and production company. The artist has his glasses broken, suffered bruises to his eyes and “was kicked multiple times,” leaving him unable to perform his role for the opening of “The Chinese Lady,” the theater said. He instead played one of the instruments during the show. “We are sharing this because the attack on this Asian American artist, which happened near Seward Park not far from where Christina Yuna Lee was tragically murdered, is another incident in a long history of violence against Asian Americans,” the statement reads. “This violence and the hatred that fuels it remain disgusting and heartbreaking and have created an environment full of fear where safety seems scarce for our Asian American neighbors.” A police spokeswoman confirmed that the artist, who is a teenager, was chased by other kids, fell near 56 Hester St. and was kicked in the face by an unknown suspect. He refused medical attention. The teen filed a report for harassment, and police said they are investigating the incident. It remained unclear Friday what motive fueled the violence. No anti-Asian statements were believed to have been made, law enforcement sources said. A rep for the theater did not respond to a Post request for additional details. The assault happened a few blocks from where a homeless man allegedly followed Lee home on Feb. 13 and fatally stabbed her inside her Chinatown apartment. Assamad Nash, 25, has been charged with murder and robbery in connection to Lee’s death. Investigators have said they believe the heinous act was sexually motivated — but have not ruled it out as a hate crime, either.
