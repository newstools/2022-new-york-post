A Wisconsin restaurant worker who was shot in face during a dispute over an incomplete order last month has spoken out about the harrowing ordeal that he thought was going to end his life. Anthony Rodriguez, 26, was working as the sole server at a George Webb location in Wauwatosa around midnight Jan. 30 when trouble arose after twin 20-year-old sisters complained their order was missing a $3 hamburger, WISN reported. “They said they weren’t going to pay, and I said, ‘OK, I’m going to take your food since you’re not paying for it,'” Rodriguez, a father of a 2-year-old boy, told Fox 6. “So I took it and threw it away.” Rodriguez said he asked the sisters, later identified as Breanta and Bryanna Johnson, to leave but the duo grew angry and all hell broke loose. The server said he was punched and body-slammed to the floor before a gunshot was fired. “I never expected to get shot being a server,” he told WISN. “I was in so much shock I don’t remember being in much pain, but I remember kind of internally freaking out and being very scared just telling myself, ‘Wow, I’m probably gonna die here,'” he recalled. Rodriguez lost many of his teeth and suffered a spine fracture in the attack. “There’s still big fragments in my throat from the bullet,” Rodriguez told WISN. The server said it’s “amazing” he’s still able to walk and talk after the near-death experience. The Johnsons have been charged with attempted homicide. The sisters are being held in jail on $100,000 bail. “(I) hope they get the judgment that they deserve because it was brutal what they did,” Rodriguez told WISN.
