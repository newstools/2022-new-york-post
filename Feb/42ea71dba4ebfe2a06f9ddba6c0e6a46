Fox Business host Neil Cavuto returned to the air Monday and ended the mystery of his five-week absence — revealing that he almost died from a second bout of COVID-19. “I did get COVID again — but a far, far more serious strand, what doctors call ‘COVID pneumonia,'” the 63-year-old host told his viewers as he returned to his “Cavuto: Coast to Coast” show. “It landed me in intensive care for quite a while and it really was touch-and-go,” he admitted. “Some of you who’ve wanted to put me out of my misery darn near got what you wished for,” he joked, adding, “Sorry to disappoint you.” As well as noting readers’ letters speculating that he had died, Cavuto also mocked the “grassy knoll theory” that he’d been sickened by getting vaccinated, which he insisted had instead saved his life. “No, the vaccine didn’t cause that. … My very compromised immune system did. “Because I’ve had cancer and right now I have multiple sclerosis, I’m among the vulnerable 3 percent or so of the population that cannot sustain the full benefits of a vaccine. “In other words, it simply doesn’t last,” he explained, while stressing that “some defense was still better than no defense.” “Let me be clear: Doctors say had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn’t be here,” he insisted. He said his network only remained mum about his near-fatal battle because he “asked them not to say anything.” “They were honoring my wishes out of respect for my privacy, even though they were getting a lot of heat trying to protect my privacy,” he said. While he did not want to be “the story,” he told his viewers that they “really do deserve an explanation from me” given how long he was absent and the wild theories that were spreading about it. “This was scary. How scary? I’m talking ‘Ponderosa suddenly out of the prime rib in the middle of the buffet line’ scary,” he quipped at the end of his explanation.
