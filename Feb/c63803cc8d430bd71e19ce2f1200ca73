A man caught shoplifting at Macy’s in Manhattan on Tuesday was found to be packing heat, police said. Malik Bramble, 21, was grabbed and held by security inside the Herald Square department store around 6:30 p.m. until the NYPD arrived, a police spokesman said. A loaded .380-caliber handgun was found inside his backpack after cops picked up the bag and noticed something heavy inside, sources said. Bramble was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, burglary and petit larceny, according to police. He was accused of stealing $374 worth of clothes, sources said. The suspect lives in Brooklyn and was arrested weeks ago and charged with grand larceny from another department store on Jan. 14, according to sources. He was also arrested twice for armed robbery in 2019, sources said.
