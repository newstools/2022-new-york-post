Kevin Durant couldn’t hurt the Knicks on the court, but that didn’t stop the injured Nets star from throwing a little salt in the home team’s wounds. The former MVP, who sat out the game between the New York City rivals Wednesday night with a sprained MCL, made note of the atmosphere and crowd noise at Madison Square Garden after the Knicks choked away a 28-point lead in the Nets’ eventual 111-106 win. Rookie Cam Thomas hit a huge 3-pointer to seal the game with 7.7 seconds left and Durant loved the reaction he heard: plenty of cheers for the visitors. “Nets fans were loud in the barc….I mean the garden tonight,” Durant tweeted shortly after the game. The comment has some added significance coming from Durant, who had been criticized for choosing a believed softer landing spot with the Nets and Barclays Center fans instead of the Knicks and the Garden faithful during free agency in 2019. The Garden has long been known for its electric atmosphere and rabid fan base, but this year’s Knicks have given the fans little to be excited about. They sunk to 25-34 Wednesday and Durant took the moment to jab the Knicks for not showing up for the meeting with their crosstown rival. At one point late in the game, it appeared Durant was throwing his thumb back in the air as if to signal for Knicks fans to hit the exits. Nets improved to 31-27 and hope to add Durant and Ben Simmons, acquired in the trade of James Harden to the 76ers, into the mix at some point after the All-Star break.
