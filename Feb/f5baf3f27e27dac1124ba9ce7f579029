So, much for “Never Say Goodbye!” New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi is selling his four-bedroom Greenwich Village condo for a whopping $22 million. Bon Jovi has put his luxurious Greenwich Lanes pad at 155 West 11th St. on the market, the Wall Street Journal was first to report. The musician — currently making headlines as the “secret weapon of Super Bowl 2022” — bought the sprawling 4,000-square-foot apartment in 2017 for $18.94 million, real estate records show. An elevator opens into a private vestibule that leads into a 40-foot living room, complete with a Juliette balcony overlooking the city bustle, with a large adjoining eat-in kitchen fully equipped with appliances, according to the property listing on Compass. There are also floor-to-ceiling windows and a private terrace. The condo’s primary bedroom suite has exposed views to the south and the east, fitted with a walk-in closet and a windowed marble bathroom. Each of the secondary bedrooms includes its own bathroom and closet space. The condo, constructed in 2013, includes access to The Greenwich Lanes’ fitness center, 75-foot swimming pool, whirlpool, steam rooms, golf simulator, and more, according to the listing. Additional amenities include a garden and reflecting pool, dining lounge for Lanes residents and a 21-seat movie room. The “Dead or Alive” singer moved to the 11th Street condo from his nearby apartment at 150 Charles St. in 2017. He reportedly took a major loss when he sold the 4,031-square-foot duplex in a building where other celebrity residents had lived, including Sports Illustrated model Irina Shayk and Ben Stiller. The 59-year-old rocker is expected to kick off his 2022 tour this April.
