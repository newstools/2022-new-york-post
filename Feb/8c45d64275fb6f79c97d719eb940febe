The Los Angeles Lakers will host the crosstown rival Clippers tonight, with the Lakers attempting to right the ship amid a disappointing season. Both teams enter this game without multiple superstars, with the Clippers missing Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, and the Lakers missing Anthony Davis. LeBron James is listed as questionable, but looks like he’ll be available. James participated in the morning shootaround today and appears poised to make his return in the Lakers’ first game after the All-Star break. He and Russell Westbrook will look to exploit a Clippers defense that holds the fifth-best defensive rating in the NBA over their last five games. Over the last 21 games without George, the Clippers are 9-12. Their offense has been improving as of late, particularly with their ability to shoot from behind the arc: They’re shooting 37.3% from three in their last 10 games, good for fourth-best in the league. Where the Lakers might be able to find an advantage is with their ability to score in the paint. The Clippers are giving up 50.8 points in the paint per game in their last 10 games, eighth-most in the NBA. Westbrook and James can wreak havoc by attacking the rim, and they’ll likely look to do so early and often in this game. With the Lakers sitting at a -2.5 spread at home tonight coming off the long break, it’s a strong bet to trust them to handle business.
