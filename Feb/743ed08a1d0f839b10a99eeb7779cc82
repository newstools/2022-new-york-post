For so many years, the Knicks have been striving for their Kevin Durant. Whether it was the Warriors superstar who hit free agency, or Kyrie Irving, LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard, they have been trying and failing for the largest piece of the puzzle since landing Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire. There are only a handful of stars capable of elevating teams into the upper echelon, and every organization is desperate for them. That the Knicks have not sold themselves well enough or stumbled into draft luck might be frustrating for fans, but it’s also understandable. Less understandable is this: Where is the Knicks’ Cam Thomas? Where is the silver lining in a season of clouds? Where is the development that allows fans to dream on promise, if not the postseason? Where is the draft find who unexpectedly becomes a fan favorite?
