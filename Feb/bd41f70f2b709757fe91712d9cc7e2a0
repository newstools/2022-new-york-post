A gunman stole $140,000 worth of jewelry from two men at an Upper Manhattan restaurant, authorities said Thursday. The victims, 32 and 33, were inside Cami Modern Kitchen and Bar on Broadway near West 184th Street in Hudson Heights just before 11:30 p.m. Wednesday when the suspect barged in, displayed a gun and demanded in Spanish, “Give me all the jewelry,” cops said. The two victims handed over the pricey bling — including a Rolex, two diamond bangles, three gold chains and two gold rings, authorities said. After the robbery, the gunman ran out of the restaurant, firing two rounds as he headed north on Broadway, cops said. The younger victim, from New Jersey, and the older man, from Yonkers, were not hurt. It was not immediately clear whether they were dining together or knew each other. Police were still looking for the suspect Thursday morning. Cops said at this time, it didn’t appear that the incident was connected to the high-end robbery ring that garnered headlines last year.
