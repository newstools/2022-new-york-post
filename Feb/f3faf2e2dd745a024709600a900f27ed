A dozen undocumented migrants trying to reach the US border sewed their mouths shut on Tuesday in a gruesome protest over the Mexican government’s refusal to allow them in. Shocking photos taken by Reuters show the migrants, mostly Central and South Americans, using needles and plastic threads to seal their mouths shut in Mexico’s southern border city of Tapachula. The migrants, including some carrying their children, left a small gap to allow them to drink liquids. They used alcohol to wipe away the blood from the stitches, the photos showed. “I’m doing it for my daughter,” Venezuelan Yorgelis Rivera told the agency. “She has not eaten anything in the last few hours and I see no solution … from the authorities.” She added, “We are like prisoners here.” Thousands of migrants have spent months in Tapachula, which borders Guatemala, as they wait for Mexico’s migration agency to allow them to freely cross the country en route to the US border. Rivera said she has been waiting for a response for more than a month. “The migrants are sewing their lips together as a sign of protest,” said Irineo Mujica, an activist at the protest. “We hope that the National Migration Institute can see that they are bleeding, that they are human beings.” Officials with the National Migration Institute called the grim protest “worrying.” “It is worrying that these measures have been carried out with the consent and support of those who call themselves their representatives, with the intention of pressuring authorities on an attention already provided,” the agency said in a statement. It receives more than 100 applications each day in the city — and it continues to tend to cases, the agency said. With Post wires
