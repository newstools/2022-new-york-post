Brothers Robert and Aron Marderosian, professionally known as Heavy Young Heathens, filed a lawsuit Thursday saying that NBC, U.S. Figure Skating, and figure skaters Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier violated their copyrights by using their version of “House of the Rising Sun” at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The brothers said Knierim and Frazier skated to their version of the traditional folk song, used in a trailer for the 2016 film “The Magnificent Seven” and a commercial for Ford Motor Co, without their permission, and also accused NBC of copyright infringement by broadcasting it. The skaters used the song in their short program earlier this month, in a performance that contributed to the U.S.’ silver medal in the team figure skating event. Heavy Young Heathens’ music has appeared in TV shows including “The Simpsons,” ads for Starbucks, and trailers for movies like “Deadpool,” according to the lawsuit. They have previously accused several other companies of misusing their work, including allegations against Fox Sports, Discovery Inc, Monster Energy, and Warner Brothers in lawsuits that later settled. The musicians’ attorney (and also father) Mick Marderosian of Marderosian & Cohen said Thursday that the skaters’ agent “basically refused to listen to our issue.” Marderosian also claims NBC has since removed posts promoting the performance. NBC, U.S. Figure Skating, and the skaters’ agent, David Baden of IMG, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The lawsuit said “House of the Rising Sun” is a “very valuable licensing asset” for Heavy Young Heathens, and asked the court for money damages, and to block any future infringement by the defendants. The case is Twelve Sixty LLC v. Comcast Corp, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, No. 8:22-cv-00255. For the musicians: Mick Marderosian and Heather Cohen of Marderosian & Cohen For the defendants: Not immediately available
