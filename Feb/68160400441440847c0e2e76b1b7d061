Tom Brady didn’t want new Super Bowl champ Matthew Stafford to repeat his misatakes. As the Rams’ victory parade got underway Wednesday in Los Angeles, the newly retired quarterback, 44, took to Twitter to offer a word of advice to Stafford, who hoisted his first Lombardi Trophy on Sunday after Los Angeles defeated the Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl 56. “Mix in a water Matt… trust me,” Brady quote-tweeted in response to a video of Stafford, holding a cigar and beer, and his wife Kelly celebrating on a parade float. Brady, who last year won his seventh Super Bowl — his first with the Buccaneers — let loose during Tampa Bay’s boat parade, where he infamously had just a “litTle avoCado tequila,” as he later tweeted. At the time of the Buccaneers’ parade, a smiley Brady needed assistance as he made his way back on land. During the festivities, Brady also shockingly tossed the Lombardi Trophy from his boat to another. Stafford, meanwhile, appears to be having the time of his life. At the podium Wednesday, the 34-year-old quarterback expressed gratitude for Rams fans before taking a swig from a bottle. “I’m damn happy to be standing up here with you guys, celebrating the ’ship,” he said. “Let’s go, y’all!” It has been a whirlwind week for the Staffords, who share four young daughters. After the win, the couple made an appearance at Drake’s postgame party before trekking to Disneyland hours later. “Congratulations on winning the Super Bowl … I can’t wait for you to bring your four kids screaming at you tomorrow for a 10-hour parade, I just hope you can act happy,” Stafford quipped on the most recent episode of Kelly’s podcast, “The Morning After.”
