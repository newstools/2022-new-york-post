Joe Burrow made sure to remind everyone how thrilled he was with the season, even if it didn’t end how he imagined. Following the Bengals’ 23-20 loss to the Rams in Super Bowl 2022, quarterback Burrow took to Twitter to apologize to fans, but also to express his gratitude for his teammates and supporters. “Sorry we couldn’t get it done. Proud of our team and our fans. Love these guys,” the 25-year-old wrote. Burrow expressed similar sentiments during his postgame press conference on Sunday. He said that despite the loss, he is still looking at this season as a major win for him and the Bengals. “We’re a young team,” Burrow said. “You like to think that we’ll be back in this situation multiple times over the course of the next few years. We’ll take this and let it fuel you for the rest of our careers.” Cincinnati’s Cinderella story comes one year after going 4-11. The Bengals made a stunning run to the final Sunday of the season behind the second-year quarterback. It just wasn’t enough. Bengals cornerback Eli Apple failed to cover Cooper Kupp with less than two minutes remaining on the clock. Rams QB Matthew Stafford threw the ball to Kupp in the back of the end zone, clinching the win for Los Angeles. During the game, Burrow appeared to hurt his knee in the fourth-quarter after being sacked by Von Miller. He looked to be in extreme pain as his teammates helped him up from the ground.and he was limping after his postgame press conference and when he walked out of SoFi Stadium. Presumably this was only made worse by the sheer number of hits Burrow took on Sunday. Despite the injury, Burrow refused to leave the game and told reporters that he would get his knee checked out when he returned to Cincinnati. “I wasn’t going out,” Burrow said. In the defeat, Burrow completed 22 of 33 passes for 263 yards and a touchdown. Burrow threw for 34 scores and 4,611 yards this year, emerging as one of the premier quarterbacks in the league.
