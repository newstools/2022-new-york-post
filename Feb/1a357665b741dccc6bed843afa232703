New Yorkers looking to buy a home may be able to find the best bang for their buck in Queens, a new study has revealed. The borough offers the most space for the money compared to Brooklyn and Manhattan, with an average selling price of $540 per square foot, according to an analysis by StreetEasy. Since the median asking price for a home in New York City was $950,000, the average homebuyer in Queens would be able to snag a property that would span a median of 1,759 square feet, or $540 per square foot, according to StreetEasy. Homebuyers in Brooklyn who purchase a property for the same price would pay $666 per square foot for a total of 1,427 square feet of space. In Manhattan, anyone who buys a property worth $950,000 would only be able to afford 589 square feet of space — or an eye-popping $1,612 per square foot. StreetEasy ranked the neighborhoods where one is more likely to stumble across a good deal. Of the top five neighborhoods where homebuyers can get the most space for the lowest price per square foot, four are in Queens and one — Brownsville — is in Brooklyn. Homebuyers in Briarwood could find a home with a median asking price of $339 per square foot — the best deal in the city, according to StreetEasy. Brownsville had the second-lowest median asking price per square foot — $348. Rounding out the top five are Kew Gardens ($355); St. Albans ($370); and South Jamaica ($371). Last year, homebuyers in Brooklyn paid a median asking price of $899,900 — which was about the same compared to 2020. But the media asking price per square foot was down 3.8%. The best bets for homebuyers looking to pay the least median price per square foot in Brooklyn are Brownsville ($348); Canarsie ($420); East New York ($424); East Flatbush ($432); and Bergen Beach ($442).
