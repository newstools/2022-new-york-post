Super Bowl 2022 will certainly be a day Van Jefferson will never forget – for a multitude of reasons. During Sunday’s game, in which Los Angeles defeated Cincinnati, the wife of the Rams receiver left early as she began to go into labor. Jefferson, meanwhile, was able to see his team win before jetting to longtime love Samaria’s side, according to new footage from “Inside the NFL.” “Van! Your wife is giving birth right now,” a SoFi Stadium staffer told Jefferson, 25, who then told his young family, “We gotta get to the hospital. We gotta go quick.” Samaria, who gave birth to a baby boy that night, said Tuesday she’s thankful staffers obliged with her wishes to tell Jefferson once the game was over. “Such a special moment!” Samaria commented of the clip. “Just glad they listened to me and waited until the END of the game to tell him.” In an interview Wednesday on “TODAY,” the couple revealed that they’re between two names for their newborn son, their third child together. “After he was born, Van walked into the room and he said, ‘I have a great idea for a name: Wynn Jefferson,'” Samaria said. “We’re torn between Wynn and Miles Jefferson.” Jefferson, who was drafted by the Rams 57th overall in 2020, told “TODAY” he “probably would’ve been freaking out” had he learned earlier Sunday that his wife was giving birth. “She’s a champ,” he said. “She didn’t want to tell me. She wanted me to be focused on the game. I appreciate her doing that. I think if she had told me, I probably would’ve been freaking out.” The couple has been together since high school.
