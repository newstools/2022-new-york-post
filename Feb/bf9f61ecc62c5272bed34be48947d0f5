Grammy-winning power couple, singer Alicia Keys and producer Swizz Beatz Dean, are in contract to sell their 5-acre gated estate in Englewood, NJ. But the hitmakers are taking a major hit on the sale. The property — which they bought from Eddie Murphy in two separate transactions for a $12.1 million sum nearly a decade ago — was last asking $9.9 million. We hear it is in contract for even less. Keys and Dean first paid Murphy $10.42 million for his 32-room mansion at 191 Brayton St. in a deal that closed in 2013. A year later, Murphy sold them an adjacent empty lot for $1.7 million at 286 Johnson Ave. Keys and Dean also spent a reported $2 million to build an art gallery to house their exte nsive collection, which includes Kaws, Maya Hayuk, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. But by 2015, they put both lots on the market for a combined $14.9 million — but no one grabbed the bait. The estate went back on the market last year at the reduced price of $9.9 million. The six-bedroom spread, with 10 full bathrooms and five powder rooms, is a Colonial-style brick home was built in the early 1980s. It features an indoor pool, a bowling alley, a movie theater and a professional recording studio. While the buyer has not been revealed, sources say that real estate developer Ben Ashkenazy, founder and CEO of Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp. — whose father and sister live nearby — toured the property twice. Keys, Dean and their two kids, Egypt and Genesis, now live mainly on the West Coast. In 2019, they paid $20.8 million for Razor House, a modernist cliffside mansion in La Jolla, Calif., crafted by architectural designer Wallace E. Cunningham that has been dubbed “America’s coolest home.” It is also rumored to be the inspiration for fictional Tony Stark’s “Iron Man” cliffside digs. Listing broker Christopher Boel, of Christie’s International Real Estate, declined comment.
