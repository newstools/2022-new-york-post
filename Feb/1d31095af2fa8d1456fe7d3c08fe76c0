The NYPD “super rookie” who shot the gunman who ambushed Officers Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora in Harlem last month was promoted to detective Tuesday. Officer Sumit Sulan, 27, was presented with detective shield No. 332, “symbolizing three brothers from the 32 [Precinct],” Commissioner Keechant Sewell said during the ceremony, according to a clip posted to the top cop’s Twitter. “Today, I had the honor of promoting Police Officer Sumit Sulan to the rank of detective,” she said. “Like his partners, he is an example that police officers are ordinary people called upon to do extraordinary things — and they often do, risking everything. The action taken by Officer Sulan likely saved the lives of the other officers responding to that apartment.” Sulan had only been on the job since April — and at Harlem’s 32nd Precinct for two months — when he responded along with Rivera, 22, and Mora, 27, to the domestic violence call on West 135th Street that turned deadly. Lashawn McNeil, 47, opened fire without warning — gunning down Rivera and Mora — prompting Sulan to jump into action. Law enforcement sources dubbed Sulan the “super rookie” for his act of heroism. “When the shooting started, Officer Sulan directed the mother and brother into the kitchen to shield them away and advanced toward the hallway where the gunman had opened fire, taking him down as he prepared to open fire again,” Sewell said during the promotion. McNeil died of his wounds days after the incident. Two days after the ambush, Sulan’s mom told The Post her son was still struggling to deal with what happened. “His brain is stuck on the situation,” Dalvir Sulan, 60, said of her hero-cop son, who emigrated from the family’s native India about 15 years ago. “I’m proud. Everyone say he did good.” “He did a great job,” she added. “We’re proud of him, but we’re sorry for both of [the other officers].”
