Russia has mobile crematoriums in its arsenal that could follow invading forces and “evaporate” dead soldiers, according to a report. The British Ministry of Defense released video of the trucks that can incinerate bodies one at a time and suggested Wednesday that the Kremlin might deploy them in its war with Ukraine to hide the number of casualties, the Telegraph reported. “If I was a soldier and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield with a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up losses was a mobile crematorium, I’d be deeply, deeply worried,” UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told the paper. “It’s a very chilling side effect of how the Russians view their forces,” he said of the footage first posted back in 2013. Wallace expects “to see some of the things they’ve done previously” and that the use of a mobile crematorium “probably says everything you need to know about the Russian regime,” according to the Telegraph. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine on Thursday and immediately started to launch missiles. Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the Post’s live coverage. Explosions rocked Kyiv, the country’s capital of 3 million people, and black smoke was seen gushing from the headquarters of Ukraine’s military intelligence. Video footage captured helicopters attacking an airport near Kyiv and attack helicopters hovering over the city’s rooftops. Dozens of people had been killed so far, Ukrainian officials said. “Russian treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted. “As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.”
