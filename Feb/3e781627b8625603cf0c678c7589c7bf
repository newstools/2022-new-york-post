Most people won’t need to mask up indoors under the Biden administration’s updated COVID-19 guidelines set to go public Friday, a new report said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will announce a change in its guidelines that will mean the vast majority of Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks indoors, according to the Associated Press, which cited two sources speaking on the condition of anonymity. Residents in about 95 percent of US counties should mask up under the current guidelines, the AP said. But the CDC has signaled a change is coming as many states and communities ease up their local COVID protocols as infections and hospitalizations come down after a spike fueled by the Omicron variant. “At @CDCgov, we have been analyzing our #COVID19 data and shifting our focus to preventing the most severe outcomes and minimizing healthcare strain,” Director Rochelle Walensky tweeted Thursday night. The current guidelines use confirmed virus cases to determine if counties fall into substantial or high-transmission categories. But on Friday, the CDC is expected to also consider hospitalizations and overall local hospital capacity, which would mean highly transmissible but less severe variants wouldn’t trigger the mask requirement. Walensky said the risk of severe cases has gone down with much of the population either vaccinated against the virus, boosted or having recovered from a bout of COVID-19. “Still, #COVID19 continues to circulate in communities,” she wrote on Twitter. “Moving forward, our approach will advise enhanced prevention efforts in communities with a high volume of severe illness and will also focus on protecting our healthcare systems from being overwhelmed.” With Post wires
