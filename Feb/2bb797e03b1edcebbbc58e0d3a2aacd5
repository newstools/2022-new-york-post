Chris Cuomo’s wife, Cristina, implored others to consider how “impactful your words” can be on Wednesday, just hours it was revealed that the former anchor allegedly propositioned one of his ex-staffers for sex. The mom of three urged her followers to be mindful of how their words could affect others during a 40-minute “self-improving” yoga class on Instagram Live with instructor Erika Halweil. “Think about how impactful your words are to other people — the ones you write, the ones you say,” Cristina said. The zen health guru noted at one point that she was turning off the Instagram comments to allow her followers to focus, adding that the “power of the word is so strong.” The yoga session came after it was revealed in a New York Times report that her ex-CNN star husband had propositioned one of his former ABC staffers for sex during a “lunch” in his office in 2011. Cuomo had allegedly invited the “young” staffer to his office on the pretext of giving her advice on how to obtain full-time employment at the network. He is accused of attacking the woman when she declined his alleged sexual advances, according to the report. The accusation was made to CNN lawyers in December just hours after Cuomo was suspended for advising his brother, then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on how to dodge his own sexual harassment accusations. Chris Cuomo was fired from CNN just days later. The unnamed accuser told the outlet she was “haunted” and “deeply traumatized” by the parallels between her experience with the TV host and those who had accused his older brother.
