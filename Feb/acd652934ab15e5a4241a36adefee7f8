A 32-year-old woman was found dead — with trauma to her head — inside her Turtle Bay luxury condo apartment late Sunday, according to authorities and police sources. The woman was found face-down on her bedroom floor inside the apartment at The Club at Turtle Bay, a high-rise on East 47th Street near Second Avenue, around 5:30 p.m., cops and the sources said. She was unconscious and unresponsive, and pronounced dead at the scene, police said. She had suffered head trauma, according to the sources. The city medical examiner’s office will determine how she died, cops said. Police could not say Monday whether the circumstances were believed to be suspicious.
