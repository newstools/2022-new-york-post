Aaron Rodgers is speaking out about his viral Instagram post from Monday, telling Pat McAfee on Tuesday there was nothing cryptic about his words of “gratitude” — which were fueled by an intense, 12-day cleanse. “Let me put this disclaimer out right now … there will be no news today and no decision on my future,” Rodgers said during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” as rumors continue to swirl about his future. “I just got out of a 12-day Panchakarma. … It’s a cleanse that originated in India. It’s been going on for thousands of years, and it’s something that I’ve done in the offseason. I’m just getting my head above the sand now and seeing what’s going on out there. But no decision about my future today,” Rodgers said. Less than 24 hours prior, Rodgers expressed gratitude for his inner circle on Instagram, including Shailene Woodley, whom the quarterback is rumored to have split from. Elsewhere on McAfee’s show, Rodgers — who said he finished the cleanse on Monday — elaborated on the experience, describing it as a treatment and dietary plan that is “about silencing your mind and your surroundings.” The quarterback, 38, added he feels incredible, and he “obviously” had thoughts about his decision about his future. “There’s conversations to be had. … I don’t have anxiety about the decision. But I am looking forward to making the decision and moving forward, and I think it’s best for me, the team and all parties involved. Let’s just get this behind us,” he said. Rodgers said “it won’t be long” until he makes his decision about whether or not he’ll return for an 18th season. “I’m not gonna hold anybody hostage like that. I want to feel certain about it, and when I do I’ll make a decision and move on and move forward,” the two-time reigning MVP said.
