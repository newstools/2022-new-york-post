No jokes here: This stand-up comic has successfully sold his idyllic Colorado retreat. According to freshly public property records, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld’s Rocky Mountain homestead sold for $14 million in late January, Mansion Global first reported. The 12,260-square-foot home is set on 27 acres of land between peaks in the town of Telluride, known for its proximity to the eponymous Telluride Ski & Golf resort. It is located in a private community called Raspberry Patch. The 11-bedroom home is designed “as an evolving series of Western ranch structures,” built by a local architect and has been gradually expanded upon over the last decade, according to a listing. There are 11 full bathrooms and three partial. According to an aerial shot of the property in 2017, it consists of a series of interconnected buildings surrounded by trees on all sides. The main living area is vaulted and features floor-to-ceiling windows offering views of the Wilson Range’s snow-capped peaks. In addition to the entry road, there is also a “well-maintained trail system,” which winds down through the trees — largely aspen and spruce — to a flowing creek. Other highlights include an outdoor patio and dining area, as well as a four-car garage, gym and yoga studio. “Recognizing the strong demand for properties, they felt this was a good time [to sell],” Compass broker Bill Fandel told Mansion Global of the Seinfelds’ decision to part ways with the property, which they first listed last March with an ask of $14.95 million. The comedian, 67, and his wife, 50 — both dedicated skiers — bought the property for $7.55 million in 2007. They’ve made a number of changes since. “After the Seinfelds purchased the property, they did a remodel and re-imagined the whole place,” said Fandel.
