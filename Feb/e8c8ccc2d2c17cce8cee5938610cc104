The Dark Knight delivered an unexpected crossover for NBA fans. With coverage of All-Star Weekend on TNT in full swing, the Caped Crusader made an unexpected appearance on the small screen in a promo and trailer for the upcoming movie, “The Batman.” Broadcaster Brian Anderson appeared to be calling a regular transition to a commercial break when the video board outside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland advertising the All-Star Game began showing an assortment of clips before eventually changing to green text saying “unmask the truth.” A digital version of the Caped Crusader showed up on the roof with the Bat-Signal in the ominous red sky behind him. In disbelief, Anderson gave play-by-play of the scene. “You guys getting this in the truck? Something’s happening outside.” Anderson said during the promo. “Hold up, is that the Bat-Signal? I think the Batman’s on the roof. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing.” What followed was a minute-long trailer featuring plenty of action from the upcoming superhero flick that stars Robert Pattinson as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle and Paul Dano portraying Riddler. The movie’s set to make its theatrical debut on March 4, but basketball fans got an early teaser of what’s to come next in Gotham.
