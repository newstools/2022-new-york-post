Despite a limited Monday college basketball slate, Charlie DiSturco of The Action Network has circled a PAC-12 conference matchup for his best bet (video above). Revenge will surely be on the mind of Washington as it prepares to welcome national title contenders UCLA to Seattle. Only nine days ago, UCLA handed the Huskies a 26-point loss on their home floor. UCLA is an absolute juggernaut on both ends of the floor. The Bruins rank inside the top-15 nationally in both offensive and defensive efficiency, don’t turn the ball over, and are a great offensive rebounding unit. Washington’s offense, DiSturco explains, is a little more one-dimensional. “Washington’s offense is…led by Terrell Brown Jr., who ranks top-10 in scoring and takes 34 percent of total shots while on the floor,” DiSturco details. Outside of that, Washington’s offense ranks around the 300-mark in terms of both two- and three-point offense. But DiSturco believes the Washington defense – a 2-3 zone that aims to frustrate opponents – will give them success in a less-than-idea spot for UCLA.  “UCLA just blew out Oregon State and have a huge home game to end their regular season on Saturday against USC,” DiSturco says. For those reasons, DiSturco says to hold your nose and back the Huskies +9 on their home floor.
