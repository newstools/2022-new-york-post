A Rikers Island inmate was pronounced dead on Sunday after being found unresponsive city officials said — marking the first reported death of 2022 at the notorious jail. The unnamed person had been in the jail since Sept. 5, the city said. An investigation is underway in the cause of death. Last year, 16 people died in Department of Correction custody, more than the previous two years combined — and the most since 2016, which saw 15 in-custody deaths, according to records. “We will work aggressively to determine the circumstances surrounding his death,” Corrections Commissioner Louis Molina said in a statement. “My deepest sympathy goes out to the loved ones of this individual.”
