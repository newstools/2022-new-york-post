One of the worst games of Jalen Ramsey’s standout career didn’t hurt his confidence. In his first tweet after winning Super Bowl 2022 with the Rams, the outspoken All-Pro cornerback told critics that “yall can’t say [sh-t] about my career now.” Ramsey spent three-plus seasons with the Jaguars, reaching the doorstep of a Super Bowl before losing in the AFC Championship Game. The 27-year-old forced his way out of Jacksonville with one of the many bold trades made by Rams general manager Les Snead, back in 2019. Since then, Ramsey signed a five-year, $100 million extension, representing the largest contract for a cornerback in history, in terms of total money, average annual salary and guaranteed money at $71.2 million. But the three-time All-Pro allowed more yards as the closest defender in coverage against the Bengals than in any other game of his career, according to NextGenStats. That being said, 75 of those yards were on a touchdown catch by Tee Higgins when Higgins got away with yanking Ramsey’s facemask and committing what should have been called offensive pass interference, according to the consensus opinion. Referee Ron Torbert did not agree when asked postgame. Ramsey also gave up a 46-yard Ja’Marr Chase reception on the Bengals’ first scoring drive and a 17-yard reception on the Bengals’ last possession. He was on the ground for the decisive fourth-and-1 play, when quarterback Joe Burrow was wrapped up by Aaron Donald before he had the time to spot an open Chase. It’s going to take more than that to rattle Ramsey, however.
