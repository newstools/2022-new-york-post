A Starbucks barista in Texas feared a teenager might have been in danger and came to her rescue by writing a message on a cup, the girl’s mom told the Post. Brandy Selim Roberson praised the employee for stepping in when her 18-year-old daughter was approached by a man she didn’t know while studying by herself at a Corpus Christi location. “The man was very loud and animated,” Roberson told the Post. A female barista came over and handed the high school senior a paper coffee cup, telling her it was “an extra hot chocolate someone forgot to pick up.” On the cup, an employee had written a message that said, “Are you okay? Do you want us to intervene? If you do, take the lid off the cup.” “She looked up and just saw a row of baristas staring at her– ready to step in,” said Roberson. The teenager didn’t need the employees to intervene and let the staff know she was okay. “This reaffirms my faith in humanity,” said Roberson, whose daughter is months away from going off to college. “Maybe just seeing this story, others…if given the opportunity to say something or turn away, they would say something.” The mother said she hopes other businesses train their staff to do the same.
