Next time you vote, remember the Democratic Socialist of America declaration blaming US and NATO “imperialist expansion” for triggering the Russian invasion. This was no fluke: Both Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bx.-Queens) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), two of the DSA’s most prominent members of Congress, agree. Yes, Sanders condemned Putin’s attempt “to take over the entire country and destroy Ukrainian democracy.” But he also approvingly  quoted a claim that “the United States deserves much of the blame” beginning “when NATO started to expand, bringing in eastern European nations, some of them bordering Russia.” NATO is a purely defensive alliance. For the record, some leftists outside the DSA are proving just as deranged. 1619 Project mastermind Nikole Hannah-Jones declared it racist for the media to pay so much attention to Ukraine. Count it as one more reason to keep the 1619 curriculum out of your children’s schools. Others go even further: City Councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan (D-Harlem) last week blamed Ukraine for the Russian invasion. Other local DSA electeds include City Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán (D-B’klyn), Rep. Jamal Bowman (D-Bx/W’chester), state Sens. Julia Salazar (D-B’klyn) and Jabari Brisport (D-B’klyn) as well as Assembly Members Marcela Mitaynes (D-Bklyn), Phara Souffrant (D-Bklyn) and Zohran Mamdani (D-Queens). Current DSA-backed candidates include: Many of these politicians say they support Ukraine, but we haven’t found any who’ve denounced DSA’s “blame America” statement. If you truly want to stand with the heroic Ukrainians, none of them deserve your support.
