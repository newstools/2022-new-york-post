RJ Barrett is out of his walking boot but still not back in the lineup. He missed his third straight game in the Knicks’ 127-123 overtime loss to the Thunder with the sprained ankle he suffered in garbage time, but Thibodeau said he’s not second-guessing his decision to keep him in the game. Barrett got injured with 18 seconds left in a 17-point loss to the Nuggets last Tuesday. The Knicks were trailing 122-107 with 3:56 left in the fourth quarter when Thibodeau subbed Barrett back into the game, but the deficit never got any closer. “You don’t look backwards,” Thibodeau said. “There’s different points, you look at the score, the time, and if you can make a run, then you take a shot at it. So that’s what we did.” Thibodeau described Barrett as “day-to-day” and doing “a little” court work, but it remains to be seen whether he could get back for the final game before the All-Star break Wednesday against the Nets. Center Nerlens Noel missed his fourth straight game with a sore left foot, but Mitchell Robinson (sore left ankle) and Cam Reddish (sore right ankle), who had been listed as questionable, were active. Robinson finished with 14 points, 17 rebounds, four blocks and four steals, but most of his production came in the first half. Reddish finished with two points in eight minutes. Ryan Arcidiacano, whom the Knicks signed to a contract for the rest of the season on Sunday, was out on the court putting up shots before Monday’s game. The former Villanova star was still battling an ankle injury when the Knicks signed him to the first of two 10-day contracts last month. But Thibodeau said Monday that the guard was healthy. The Thunder arrived in New York shorthanded, missing their top two scorers to injuries — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a sprained ankle and Luguentz Dort had a shoulder strain.
