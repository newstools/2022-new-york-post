Cops released footage Saturday of a goon that accosted a man in Manhattan for cash earlier this month — and they’re asking for the public’s help to find the suspect. The mugger tussled with the man in front of La Casa De Pollo, a restaurant on Broadway in Washington Heights on the evening of Feb. 17, according to security video and the NYPD. He wrestled $200 out of the victims hand and fled on foot uptown, police said. The suspect was said to be in his 40s, and was seen wearing a winter hat, black jacket, beige pants and black sneakers. No one was injured.
