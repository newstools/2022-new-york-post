The idea of more “Sopranos” spinoffs seems to have gotten whacked by show creator David Chase, one HBO executive said. HBO and HBO Max Chief Content Officer Casey Bloys spoke to Deadline about the future of the “Sopranos” universe, which is sure to bum out fans from the Garden State all the way down to Boca Raton. “I don’t think David has any interest in doing anything more with ‘The Sopranos.’ ‘The Sopranos’ is a terrific and classic show. I don’t think there’s any reason to open that back up,” Bloys said. “I really don’t know what he’s thinking but one thing I can say is I just don’t think anything with ‘The Sopranos’ family is on the cards.” For months fans hoped that Chase — who inked a five-year production deal with HBO’s parent company WarnerMedia in October — was signing on to expand on the show as a follow-up to the luke-warm received “Many Saints of Newark.” The prequel film starred Alessandro Nivola as “Dickie” Moltisanti, Jon Bernthal as “Johnny Boy” Soprano and James Gandolfini’s son Michael as a high school-aged Tony Soprano. “In terms of ‘The Many Saints of Newark,’ I’m not exactly sure if they’re thinking [about] another movie,” he added. Hype for another potential chapter of James Gandolfini’s legendary, six-season TV run was reinvigorated after Jamie-Lynn Sigler (Meadow Soprano) and Robert Iler (AJ Soprano) reunited in a show-stealing Chevy Super Bowl commercial that re-filmed the show’s iconic intro drive on the southbound New Jersey Turnpike, the chief content officer noted. “I think maybe the Super Bowl ad … was an indication that someone’s going back. As far as I know, I don’t think [Chase] has any plans to do that,” Bloys said.
