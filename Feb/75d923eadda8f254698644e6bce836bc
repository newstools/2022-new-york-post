Marc Malusis has a new platform in New York sports. Malusis, the longtime WFAN personality, is the new lead sports anchor at WPIX. The news was first reported by Newsday’s Neil Best. The Post’s Andrew Marchand added that Malusis will keep hosting his Sunday NFL pregame show on WFAN, and do occasional other weekend shows. It’s still possible he will keep doing some SNY appearances. Malusis, once a board operator for “Mike and the Mad Dog,” most recently co-hosted “Moose and Maggie” on WFAN middays with Maggie Gray. In early December, The Post broke the news that the show would be replaced by Tiki Barber and Brandon Tierney. Gray wound up moving to CBS Sports radio, hosting a program with Andrew Perloff, the former “Dan Patrick Show” producer.
