Columbia University suspended its top shrink Wednesday after he suggested a black model’s dark skin could make her a “freak of nature.” Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, head of the school’s psychiatry department, retweeted a photo of South Sudanese-American model Nyakim Gatwech and wrote, “Whether a work of art or freak of nature she’s a beautiful sight to behold.” Columbia did not provide a statement on Lieberman’s comments. But the Manhattan school confirmed that he was suspended from his department chair role Wednesday due to the comments and was also removed as the psychiatrist-in-chief at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital. “I tweeted from my personal account a message that was racist and sexist. Prejudices and stereotypical assumptions I didn’t know I held have been exposed — to myself and to you — and I’m deeply ashamed and very sorry,” Lieberman wrote in a Tuesday email to faculty and staff that was provided to The Post. “An apology from me to the Black community, to women, and to all of you is not enough. I’ve hurt many, and I am beginning to understand the work ahead to make needed personal changes and over time to regain your trust,” he added. The post also cost Lieberman his role as the director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, run by the state Office of Mental Health. “The Office of Mental Health took immediate action after learning of Dr. Lieberman’s offensive and inappropriate comments on social media,” it told The Post in a statement Thursday. Gatwech, who unwittingly found herself at the center of the controversy, responded to Lieberman’s comments on Instagram, saying, “I love my dark skin and my nickname ‘Queen of Dark.'” Lieberman could not be reached by The Post on Thursday.
