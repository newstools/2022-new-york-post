A mom-to-be has shared the bizarre pregnancy symptom she experienced that left her skin soft and squidgy like dough. Carla shared a video with her TikTok followers which captured the strange side effect of her pregnancy at 39 weeks. In the clip, her baffled partner can be seen pressing his finger into her leg which appears soft and squishy, with his hand leaving an imprint on her skin. Captioning her video, the first time mom wrote: “Being pregnant is fun.” While the symptom may seem bizarre, it is actually quite a common side effect of pregnancy in women and is known as pitting edema. The condition typically occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy, according to Medical News Today, and is most common in the legs, ankles, and feet. While the symptom is usually nothing to worry about, experts suggest discussing any new symptoms with your doctor as it can be linked to very high blood pressure. Despite Carla’s condition being a seemingly normal one, her video baffled her followers receiving over 13 million views and thousands of comments. One wrote: “Your man looks traumatized.” “Just like dough!” wrote another, while a third added, “She became a memory foam!” “Slime without the Borax”, added another.
