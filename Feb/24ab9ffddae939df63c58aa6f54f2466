The former head of the NYPD’s special victims unit put in his retirement papers just two days after being bounced from the long-embattled division, The Post has learned. Inspector Michael King, who was touted by police leadership for his background as a forensic nurse when appointed in August 2020, filed for retirement Friday, according to police sources. King’s last day on the job will be March 30, the sources added. The 45-year-old inspector, who joined the NYPD in 2000, said the post at the top of the Special Victims Division was a “dream job” for him when he took over the spot from  Chief Judith Harrison. But King’s 18-month tenure leading the unit of 225 investigators was marred by longstanding issues and his questions over his leadership. The division, which handles sexual assault and child abuse cases, faced backlash last year following an emotional City Council hearing when one survivor detailed her “botched” investigation in which the unit tried to stick her with the bill to test her for date-rape drugs. Advocates and police sources had previously complained to The Post that King, who never worked as a detective, created too much paperwork for the short-staffed unit and that he lacked the managerial and investigatory skills to run the unit. Former Chief of Department Rodney Harrison also called out the division head for his cops’ shoddy paperwork during a crime statistics meeting last year. King, who previously ran the Crime Scene Unit, was slated to move to an unknown post in Patrol Bureau Queens South, according to a police memo sent out Thursday. It is not yet known who will take over the division. The NYPD did not immediately respond for comment. Additional reporting by Tina Moore
