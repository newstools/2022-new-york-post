Our feet take the brunt of the work throughout the day. We stand, we walk, we run…we even skip if we’re in the right mood. But we need to make it up to our feet, that literally support us all day long. One way to do that is by giving them a much-needed spa day in the comfort of your own home. If you want to give your feet some love, we’ve got a great item that’ll help you do just that. Give yourself a deep-tissue massage with the oFlexiSpa Steam Foot Bath Massager. It features electric massaging rollers designed to give your feet the ultimate feel-good treatment. With 3 heating levels and 2 intensities, you’ll be able to find the perfect setting for your needs. This foot steamer and massager generates steam after just 30 seconds and keeps warm for 20 minutes, ensuring a nice, long-lasting massage. Plus, it conserves water (it only needs less than 1 cup), making it eco-friendly and is great for those who suffer from chronic pain or who are on their feet all day. The oFlexiSpa is also safe and hygienic as it prevents boiling water backflow and splashing. You can place it in any room of your home, thanks to its small and modern design. It’s something the whole family can enjoy using! This foot massager has an ability to reduce swelling in the feet (perfect for those who walk or run a lot) and will make your feet feel much softer due to all the steam. Put your feet up, or in this case inside the steamer, relax, and enjoy the massage benefits. It received stellar reviews from customers with 4.3 out of 5 stars. One customer says, “This foot massager is like the thing you didn’t know you needed. As a person who spends 10+hours on their feet/5 days a week, this has helped relieve my sore and tired feet. It’s also provided me with some relief from my plantar fasciitis.” You can get the oFlexiSpa Steam Foot Bath Massager for 34% off while it’s on sale for only $169.99 for a limited time!
