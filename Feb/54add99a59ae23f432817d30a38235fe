It’s Bedlam on the hardwood as the Oklahoma State Cowboys head to Norman to take on the Oklahoma Sooners. This will be the second rendition, and the Cowboys were victorious in the first meeting just a few weeks ago. These two teams, however, have gone down very different paths since. Coach Porter Moser’s Sooners have done anything but boom as they are in the midst of a horrific stretch. They will come into this matchup having lost their last four, but the bigger picture is worse as they are 3-12 since Jan. 4. A return home for this rivalry game may be what they need to get back on track. The Cowboys have continued to trade wins and losses for the past month. Oklahoma State is excellent on its home floor as their energy and style of defense feeds off the crowd, but it had been a very different story on the road. The Cowboys have won only two games on the road all season. So it seems as if the victory here will also be bucking a downward trend. This is a matchup in which you have to expect Oklahoma’s best effort. The Sooners can change their season outlook if they take down their archrivals at home. They are due in more ways than one, and I think the home crowd will only enhance their performance here. The Sooners are the better team here according to KenPom, but the market may not give them that much respect. So I’ll be looking to back them as a short favorite. The play: Oklahoma, -4
