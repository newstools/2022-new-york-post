A Brooklyn man has been charged with murder for fatally stabbing his roommate during a fight in their apartment, police said. Officers responding to a call of an assault at 641 Crown St. in Crown Heights at about 7 p.m. Thursday discovered Steven Beckles, 45, with a stab wound to his chest, cops said. Beckles was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital. The roommate, Denie Baptiste, 40, is now charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon, authorities said. Baptiste surrendered to police at the 77th Precinct, police and sources said. “We don’t know what the nature of the argument was about,” an NYPD spokesman said Saturday.
