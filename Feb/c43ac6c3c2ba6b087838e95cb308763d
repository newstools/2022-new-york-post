Kanye West has netted $2.2 million in sales since announcing that his forthcoming album, “Donda 2,” will only be available through his own music player. The “All the Lights” rapper shared in an Instagram post Saturday his purported sales since revealing a day earlier that he would release the record only with the purchase of his $200 “Stem Player.” “We’ve made $2,227,012.05 in 24 hours,” West wrote. “God is good Thank you guys for taking this journey.” His Stem Player lets users “customize any song,” according to its sale page. West announced this week that he was shunning services like Spotify, Amazon, Youtube, and Apple for being unfair to artists. “It’s time to free music from this oppressive system. It’s time to take control and build our own,” he said.
