With over 21 thousand fans and winning the approval of Gigi Hadid, it’s hard to compete with this beloved Free People shacket. Flash back to its first day on the Free People site, and it completely sold out. Since then, it’s been restocked 26 times. Perhaps it’s the jacket’s waffle-knit material or effortlessly cool vibe that makes it so desirable. Or maybe it’s the slouchy, lived-in look it gives off. Whatever it is, there’s no doubt that fans are obsessed with this oversized shacket. “This is the best lightweight jacket I’ve ever owned,” said one happy reviewer. “I can’t stop thinking about how I need to buy more in case they’re ever sold out for good.” Another pleased customer said it’s their “favorite, go-to top,” as she wears it over T-shirts, dresses, jeans and more. The famous jacket has 4.4 out of five stars and more than 200 glowing reviews. The oversized fit, drop sleeves, button-up collar design and front pockets make it too good to pass up. Best of all, you can find it in seven different colors.
