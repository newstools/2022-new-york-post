DeLorean Motor Company appears to be taking another shot at going “Back To the Future,” teasing plans to reinvent itself as a maker of electric vehicles. DeLorean, best known for the appearance of its iconic but ill-fated car in the 1985 movie starring Michael J. Fox., released a 15-second teaser video this week hinting at its upcoming plans. “The Future was never promised. Reimagine today,” the company said on Twitter. The short clip features the silhouette of a car with the DeLorean’s distinctive gull-wing doors. In an accompanying tweet, the company mentioned the “premiere of the DeLorean in 2022” and hashtags suggesting the reboot will be an electric vehicle. DeLorean Motor Company’s website has few other details about what the public can expect from the relaunch. But officials said the firm is planning to set up its global headquarters at Port San Antonio in Texas. “In an increasingly competitive electric vehicle market, San Antonio is ready to lead,” San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said in a statement. “By planning to establish their global headquarters in San Antonio, DeLorean is validating the talent, strategic preparation, and adaptability our region provides for EV manufacturers to thrive.” DeLorean said its arrival in San Antonio was “contingent on final approvals of various incentive packages,” the San Antonio Express-News reported. The company said its relaunch will support 450 jobs across “executive, management, and engineering roles.” DeLorean hasn’t released any details about the electric vehicle itself. In its current form, the company provides services and support for the remaining DeLorean vehicles on the road. The company did not immediately return a request for comment. While the DeLorean has maintained a novelty appeal due to its “Back To The Future” roots, just 9,000 of the vehicles were ever produced. The original company struggled for years before going bankrupt in 1982.
