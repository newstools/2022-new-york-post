Three thieves busted into a Brooklyn apartment before one of them shot the 39-year-old resident in a horrifying home-invasion robbery on Saturday afternoon, police said. The victim, a 39-year-old man, answered a knock at his door in Sheepshead Bay at about 2 p.m. by a woman who claimed he did not pay his monthly dues for an unknown expense, according to cops. When the resident opened the door of his Voorhies Avenue apartment, two gun-wielding men forced their way inside and demanded some of his belongings, police said. A fight broke out and one of the robbers shot the victim in the leg, authorities said. The two male suspects then bound the resident’s wrists with zip ties and looted his apartment. Police said the crooks snatched a Rolex watch, iPhone 12 and credit cards. They fled, along with the woman, and remained at large early Monday. The victim was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn in stable condition.
