TAMPA — Beck Way, a 22-year-old right-hander who finished last season with High-A Hudson Valley, casually mentioned this week while talking to reporters at Steinbrenner Field that he hit 100 mph on the radar gun in 2021. A year ago around this time, left-hander Ken Waldichuk, who might find his way onto the Yankees’ pitching staff at some point this season, mentioned his noticeable increase in velocity. Throughout the Yankees minor league system, now littered with arms with triple-digit velocity, there’s been an increased focus on a simple strategy: throwing harder. Director of pitching Sam Briend said the benefits aren’t difficult to figure out.
