And just like that, it’s gone. ESPN’s “SportsCenter” account deleted a cringe tweet featuring a meme from HBO’s “Euphoria.” If you wish to avoid spoilers about the show’s second season finale, do not proceed. Twitter user @LukeZim snagged a screenshot of the now-deleted tweet, in which “SportsCenter” posted a photo of 13-year-old character Ashtray, who has lived a life replete with drugs and violence, with the caption, “Name an athlete as fearless as this guy.” In the season finale on Sunday, Ashtray killed a rival drug dealer and had a violent standoff with police, shooting a cop. Ashtray is played by the actor Javon Walton. Reached for comment, an ESPN spokesperson told The Post, “The content posted was not in alignment with ESPN’s brand and we removed it.”
