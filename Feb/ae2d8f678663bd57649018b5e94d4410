State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli is now proudly using his power as sole trustee of the state’s Common Retirement Fund to push “diversity, equity and inclusion” on corporate America — potentially compromising taxpayer-funded and -guaranteed savings to impose the DEI agenda, which is far more radical than the label’s words. “Corporate America must foster and protect racial and gender equity in the workplace, in company policies and in how it interacts with customers,” DiNapoli blathered last week, never noting that “equity” is far different from “equality.” This isn’t about affirmative action, but outright quotas, speech codes and training in “white supremacy culture.” That announcement follows his earlier vow to push corporations to conduct “racial equity” audits of their operations, which means bringing in consultants to seek out racism as the woke define it. He’s filing shareholder proposals demanding such audits of Amazon, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Dollar General Corp., Dollar Tree, Inc. and Match Group for starters. He’s been at it for a while: Last May, DiNapoli lectured Amazon: “The call for racial equity is not going away and neither are Amazon’s shareholders” — who proceeded to vote down his proposal. Since the fund he runs controls $267.8 billion in assets, his push will be felt. And no matter that any publicly traded company already faces a host of regulators (local, state and federal) on fair hiring, nondiscrimination and so on. His excuse is that inequitable “business practices threaten the bottom line.” So does money wasted on these consultants. All he’s really doing is using the power he’s entrusted with to curry favor with the left, and push corporate America to be even more politically correct than it already is.
