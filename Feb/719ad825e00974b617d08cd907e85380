If President Joe Biden wants to stop Russia from invading Ukraine, why on Earth would he send Vice President Kamala Harris to Europe to address the issue? Harris flew Thursday to the Munich Security Conference to work with allies to try to stop Russia’s Vladimir Putin from sending in the  150,000 troops he has encircling Ukraine.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the early stages of an invasion are already “unfolding.” But Harris has next to no diplomatic experience, beyond her (laughable) mission to address the “root causes” of the migrant flood at the southern border. The result of that? More illegal immigrants (nearly 2 million) than ever crossed the border last year. What sort of decision-making is going on in the myopic White House bubble? Is this an attempt to burnish her standing on the world stage and reset her disastrous image at home? If so, it is a reckless and risky way to pursue selfish political ends. Asked tough questions, she often simply cackles. When NBC’s Lester Holt last year asked her why she hadn’t visited the border, she pleaded that she’d never been to Europe either. Well, Biden has fixed that now. Just last month, Team Biden tweeted a Harris statement blasting the United States for its racial discrimination, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and transphobia. “The work to address injustice wherever it exists remains the work ahead,” she warned. Putin must be quaking in his boots. Russia’s threat to Ukraine — and broader peace — is a serious matter, and stopping it is no task for rookies. (Anyone remember the last time peace negotiators got it wrong in Munich on the eve of war?) The only thing in Harris’ favor is that she had no part in handling Biden’s last big foreign-policy crisis — Afghanistan. Maybe she is the best they have to offer.
