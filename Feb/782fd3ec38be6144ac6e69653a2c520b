A trio pistol-whipped a woman in East Harlem and used bats to smash her car — with two children inside, cops said. The 22-year-old victim got out of her car on Park Avenue near East 117th Street around 9 p.m. Friday when three strangers approached her, police said late Tuesday. One of them flashed a gun and then handed it off to a second man, who used it to strike her on the left side of the head, causing swelling and bruising, authorities said. Then the trio bludgeoned her car with baseball bats as two children sat inside, police said. The victim managed to drive away to a safe location, and the suspects took off. The victim was treated by EMS for minor injuries, cops said. Cops released surveillance images of the trio Tuesday night. The motive for the attack — which occurred in the confines of the 25th Precinct — remained unclear Wednesday morning. According to NYPD statistics released last week, major crimes in Harlem’s five police precincts are up 29.5 percent this year compared to the same period last year. While the crime rates are actually higher in many other city neighborhoods — with the Big Apple experiencing an overall 41 percent jump in serious crimes so far this year compared to 2021 — Harlem has been getting the lion’s share of the headlines. The Upper Manhattan neighborhood’s recent spree of violence included the horrific deaths of NYPD cops Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora — from the 32nd Precinct — who were ambushed by career criminal Lashawn McNeil during a domestic violence call Jan. 21.
