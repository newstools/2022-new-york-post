Sean McVay won’t be leaving the Rams. Amazon Prime Video were planning on meeting next week with the Los Angeles head coach about him becoming an NFL TV game analyst, and sources felt the platform might go as high as offering five years and $100 million for its exclusive Thursday Night Football package in the fall. But McVay has said no, presumably with a big raise from the Rams in hand. The Super Bowl winning coach was making a reported $8.5 million per season. On Friday night, ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted that he was told by McVay that he “is not pursuing any television opportunities, and he is committed to helping the Rams defend their Super Bowl title.” The television opportunities were pursuing McVay. McVay had interest from Amazon and Fox. With Amazon, McVay could have potentially teamed with Al Michaels, who is on the 1 yard line to becoming Amazon’s lead play-by-player on its “Thursday Night Football” telecasts. Michaels has wanted to know who his analysts would be, but now Troy Aikman, John Lynch and McVay have all said no. Aikman left for ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” for $90-plus million over five. Aikman could be followed by his longtime Fox partner, Joe Buck. ESPN wants to reunite the duo, while Fox hopes to keep Buck. If ESPN doesn’t land Buck, it likely will turn its attention to Michaels as Aikman’s potential partner.
