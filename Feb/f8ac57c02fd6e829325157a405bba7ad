This ain’t the Metaverse. A heavyweight of a home in California’s Silicon Valley has hit the market with a tech mogul-sized ask of $110 million. When and if it sells, it will likely obliterate the tech hub’s previous sales record of just $43.5 million, according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.com. That record was set by a mansion in the Pacific Heights neighborhood last year. The median home-sale price in the San Francisco Bay area is $1.3 million. The newly built 14,000-square-foot spread is located at 890 Mountain Home Road in Woodside and is done up like an Italian villa. It sits on more than 3 acres and boasts a 65-foot pool, an “entertainment zone” with an outdoor kitchen and fire pit, landscaped gardens that include fountains, a vineyard with more than 40 olive trees and a rose garden with more than 100 roses as well as a private hiking trail, according to the listing with Scott Dancer of Compass. The property consists of a main house, an “executive” office and conference center, a fitness center with a hair salon and a two-bedroom guesthouse. Other trappings of the billionaire lifestyle include: retractable glass walls, French oak floors, hand plastering, “rare” Italian marbles, crystal chandeliers, marble fireplaces, Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances and a separate chef’s kitchen. But wait, there’s more! The master suite has a barrel-vaulted foyer and a cathedral-beamed ceiling. No need to schlep to Italy! Chilly? The two-sided Davinci fireplace is split between the bed and bath, which also has heated limestone floors and a steamy marble bath for two. But it wouldn’t be Sillicon Valley without gratuitious technology. That’s why the entire house is wired with state-of-the-art automated systems that perform various, unspecified tasks. Never-leave-your-home amenities include an Atmos Dolby screening room, a golf simulator, indoor-and-outdoor lounges, and an epic wine salon for 6,000 bottles. Billionaires hit “like.”
