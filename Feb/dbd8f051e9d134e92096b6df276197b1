Bettors have 64 games to choose from Wednesday’s college basketball slate and Matty Cox, Ky McKeon and Jim Root of The Action Network are here to give their top underdog bets (video above). Starting with McKeon, he’s a fan of the Citadel as road underdogs against Mercer. “The Citadel’s defense is the concern, but they can shoot,” McKeon explains. As for Root, he’s targeting Rutgers in a Big Ten conference matchup with Michigan, who just suspended head coach Juwan Howard. “[Rutgers] has proven they can win away from the RAC against a good team,” Root says. Against a less-than-full-strength Michigan team, Root expects the Scarlet Knights are a good underdog to back. Finally, Cox is looking at Bradley at Missouri State, which is a five-and-a-half point home favorite, for his underdog bet. “Missouri State is so Jekyll and Hyde,” Cox says. “When they’re in the right spot and motivated, they can be really awesome, but…we reiterate the high-variance type of teams, there’s no better example than Missouri State.” Because Cox believes the Braves can win multiple ways, he’s backing them as a Wednesday road underdog.
