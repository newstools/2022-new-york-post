Harrowing footage shows a Russian tank flattening a passenger car on the outskirts of  Ukraine’s capital — with a civilian inside who appeared to miraculously survive. Video of the shocking moment posted online early Friday showed the tank swerving to drive over the car in Kyiv’s Obolon district before reversing back over it. Several people are heard in the clip shrieking in horror while the tank sits atop the car before rolling backward. Sporadic gunfire is also heard in the background. Another video showed an elderly man being rescued from the flattened car moments later. He appeared to be alert, but the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear. Several people went to the scene to free him from the obliterated vehicle in the aftermath of the apparently intentional attack. The tank is believed to be a Strela-10 — an anti-aircraft vehicle used by both the Russian and Ukrainian armies, The Sun reported. “I saw an armored vehicle and there was automatic fire,” said Kyiv resident Viktor Berbash, 58. “And here this car, with probably an anti-aircraft gun on it, was already here.” Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the Post’s live coverage. The tank deliberately targeted the civilian vehicle, Berbash claimed. “It was not by chance, it was for fun, there was no need for this,” Berbash continued. “And it just ran into this car. Stopped, reversed over it again and drove on.” The footage came as Russian forces, including tanks, were closing in on the Ukrainian capital Friday in an attack that began before dawn. Ukraine’s defense ministry, meanwhile, urged locals to make Molotov cocktails to “neutralize the occupier” and to stay indoors Friday if possible.
