Action Network college basketball analyst Anthony Dabbundo is here to share his best bets, with both bets involving Top-25 teams. His first play comes in Penn State vs. Michigan State at Bryce Jordan Arena, where the Nittany Lions are three-point home underdogs. Even though Michigan State is favored, Dabbundo says it has been quite fortunate this season. “[Michigan State] has an impressive 18-6 record, but shot quality says they should be closer to 13-11,” Dabbundo details. Given the Spartans are 187th in the nation in half-court shot quality, Dabbundo expects a solid performance from the Penn State defense at home. Thus, take the hosts +3 points. As for his second play, Dabbundo is keying in on another Big Ten conference matchup: Wisconsin vs. Indiana. The Hoosiers are three-point home favorites, and Dabbundo likes them to continue building an impressive home resume Tuesday against the Badgers. “Wisconsin is number eight in the country in KenPom.com luck,” Dabbundo says. “They also don’t guard the post well – Indiana should get Trayce Jackson-Davis going.” For those reasons, back Indiana as home favorites in a good revenge spot.
