She’s traded prop guns for tattoo guns. The rookie armorer at the center of the fatal shooting on the set of Alec Baldwin’s Western flick “Rust” has a new gig, according to photos obtained by The Post. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was spotted Monday heading to a new job as the receptionist at Belton Tattoo in Bullhead City, Arizona. The photos show her returning to work after lunch with friends. The sighting marks the first time Gutierrez-Reed has been seen since being named in a new lawsuit brought by the family of the late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Hutchins was killed on-set after Baldwin allegedly pulled the trigger on a gun that was supposedly “cold” and meant to be loaded with blanks. Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer for the production, was responsible for all weapons and ammunition, as well as prop duties for “Rust”. It was only Gutierrez-Reed’s second film as head armorer. Appearing on a podcast during her first stint as armorer for the Nicholas Cage film “The Old Way,” Gutierrez-Reed said that loading blanks was the “scariest” part of her job. The 24-year-old is the daughter of veteran Hollywood armorer Thell Reed. In a suit filed by the armorer last month, Gutierrez-Reed alleged that her ammunition supplier irresponsibly sold blank and live rounds together. The armorer said she remembers cleaning the gun that Baldwin used and placed in it what she thought was another round from the dummy ammo box, according to the suit.
