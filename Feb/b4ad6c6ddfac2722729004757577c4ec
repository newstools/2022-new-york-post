They got shafted. Longtime residents of an English housing estate were shocked to learn they live in a phallic-shaped cul-de-sac after seeing satellite images of the block on Google Maps, SWNS reported. Adding insult to injury, the apparently symmetrical member — known as Norfolk Road — appears to be urinating on the adjacent streets in their neighborhood of Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Still, real estate prices are in the rise in the area,  with some houses going for a near £150,000, or about $203,000 USD. One anonymous resident sees that trend going onward and upward despite the newfound revelation, saying, “They’ve just gone up and up.” “Over the last couple of years, they’ve rocketed. I don’t think this would effect that growth — at least not in a negative way,” the resident said. “It’s not really that kind of village though. They’re not really interested in stuff like that,” said the owner of Sandhill Tavern, a pub directly facing the naughty neighb. “I’ve never heard anybody mention it – and it looks like a penis from above? Wow!” he said upon first sight, quickly admitting his pub appears to be “urinated on.” Still, throughout the years it’s been a point of discussion in Barnsley, according to the tavern owner. “I’ve not really noticed. We’ve never had anybody mention it to us in the pub. I don’t think anyone has looked on Google Maps… I’ve never given it any thought as I didn’t know. I think everyone would be more or less in the same boat and wouldn’t have noticed.” Fortunately, some social media sleuths were able to spot the big fella, quickly turning the genital-like roadway into the butt of their jokes. “Town planners in Yorkshire didn’t think anybody would notice…” Chris Kelly, who snapped a pic of the obscene street quipped. One Twitter user was hard on the pub, joking, “won’t be drinking in the Sandhill Tavern any time soon.”
