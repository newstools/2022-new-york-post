The James Harden era in Philadelphia is set to officially begin. He will make his 76ers debut Friday against the Timberwolves, according to The Athletic. After growing discontent with the Nets, the 32-year-old maneuvered a move to team up with Joel Embiid in the blockbuster deal that landed the Nets Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and two first-rounders. In his final days with the Nets – and since arriving in Philadelphia – Harden sat with a tight hamstring, and hasn’t played since Feb. 2. He was averaging 22.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 10.2 assists with the Nets before the injury. Harden has said Philadelphia was originally his preferred destination when forcing his way off the Rockets, before teaming up with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in Brooklyn. New Net Simmons, meanwhile, is still getting into game-shape after sitting the entirety of the season thus far because of mental health concerns. Steve Nash said Thursday that conditioning was the only thing keeping him from making his Nets debut. The Nets and 76ers will next meet on March 10.
