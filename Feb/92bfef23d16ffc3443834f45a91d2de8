A 15.1-carat fancy vivid blue diamond is projected to be auctioned for a whopping $48 million — the highest estimate ever for a blue diamond. The gemstone — known as the De Beers Cullinan Blue — will be the largest fancy vivid blue diamond to appear in an auction when it is offered up in April at Sotheby’s Hong Kong. The jewel was first discovered in April 2021 at the South African Cullinan mine, which, according to Sotheby’s, is one of the very few places in the world to discover rare blue gems. According to the mine’s owner, Petra Diamonds Ltd., it produced 1.9 million carats last year. “Blue diamonds of any kind are rare on the market, but this is the rarest of the rare; nothing of remotely similar caliber has appeared at auction in recent years,” said Chairman of Sotheby’s Asia Patti Wong. The chunk of stone was originally cut from a 39.34-carat rough piece from the mine, which was purchased from De Beers in 2008. The mine is also the source of the largest rough gem diamond ever discovered. In 1905, the hefty 3,106 carat rock was cut to create two of the British Crown Jewels. The Cullinan mine has produced other famed stones, such as the Blue Moon of Josephine discovered in 2015, which sold for just over $48 million, setting the record for the highest price per carat sold at auction.
