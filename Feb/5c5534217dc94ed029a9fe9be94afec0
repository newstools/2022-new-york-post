An NYC loft with high-brow design features has been billed as an “art piece” — with a rarefied $5.4 million price tag to match. This sculptural Soho apartment just hit the market for the first time in a quarter century. And, thanks to the abundance of original detail added by its seller, it really is quite singular. For the asking price of $5.495 million, buyers get not only 2,500 square-feet of light-filled Manhattan real estate, but also a variety of unique installations built into its floor plan. The three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom unit composes the entire second floor of 112 Prince St., a cooperative building that comes with a monthly maintenance fee of $2,722. Built out by 25-year-resident and conceptual artist Michael Somoroff as well as architect Stephen Wanta, the living and dining rooms are defined by floor-to-ceiling post-modern-style handcrafted sculptures made of Italian Marmoline. The sculptures flank the main area’s perimeter and were built by artisans onsite, according to the unit’s City Realty listing. The study isn’t lacking in bespoke features either, with the office area constructed on a raised “stage” and a sky-high bookshelf that can only be accessed with a ladder. The eat-in kitchen has a number of personal touches in addition to a generous amount of counter space. In the loft’s southern portion there is a laundry room and keyed elevator entrance. The master bedroom has an ensuite bath just feet from the bed, making it possible to roll directly into the decadent soaking tub. In terms of original details attached to this 122-year-old building, there is a restored wooden-beam ceiling, cast iron columns and six wooden framed windows. The ceilings are a soaring 13-feet, and the building also features a common roof deck and basement storage.
