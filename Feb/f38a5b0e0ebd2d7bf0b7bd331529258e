Three people were struck, one fatally, by subway trains in a barely 10-hour span in New York City Tuesday into Wednesday, police and transit officials said. The deceased was struck by a southbound 6 train at Spring Street station in Soho around 10:54 p.m., the MTA said. The male victim was recovered alive and sent to Bellevue Hospital but later died. It was not clear what he was doing in the roadbed, police said. The fatal collision occurred less than two hours after a male victim jumped in front of a Manhattan-bound M train pulling into Marcy Avenue station in Brooklyn, according to the MTA and NYPD. J and M service was suspended for over two hours as a result of the 9:28 p.m. incident, with service only resuming at 11:31 p.m., according to the MTA. The earlier fatality at Spring Street resulted in the suspension of 6 train service for just over an hour, transit officials said. A third man, who according to cops was “apparently homeless,” was struck by a westbound 7 train at Bryant Park station at 7:03 a.m. Wednesday, and survived. An MTA rep said regular 7 train service had resumed by 7:50 a.m. Transit officials have faced an increase in subway track trespassers of all sorts of late, spurring MTA Chairman Janno Lieber to form a track safety task force. The MTA faces pressure from some elected officials to install platform barriers at some stations. Lieber has said the concept is costly but worth considering.
