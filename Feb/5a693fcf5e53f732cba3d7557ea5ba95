A swimmer has died from “catastrophic injuries” after being viciously attacked by a shark Wednesday off a popular beach near Sydney, according to reports. Emergency crews responded to Buchan Point in Malabar about 4:30 p.m. local time after reports from beachgoers that a great white had attacked a swimmer, abc.net.au reported. “Unfortunately, this person had suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the attack and there was nothing paramedics could do when we arrived on the scene,” NSW Ambulance Inspector Lucky Phrachanh said, according to the outlet. The attack was reportedly the first shark fatality in Sydney since 1963. Footage showed the harrowing scene, where the churning water had turned red. “Someone just got eaten by a shark!” a man yelled in the video, adding that the shark was a “big great white,” news.com.au reported. “That’s insane,” he added. A police officer said on the radio: “Footage clearly shows a body, half a body, being taken by a shark,” adding that first responders “found some remains.” Kris Linto, a witness, told 9 News that the beast attacked the swimmer “vertically.” “We heard a yell and turned around it looked like a car had landed in the water, a big splash, then the shark was chomping at the body and there was blood everywhere,” he told the outlet.“It was really bad,” he added. Dylan Parker, the mayor of the Sydney suburb of Randwick, said the community was in shock. “The coast is our community’s backyard,” he told abc.net.au. “Little Bay is normally such a calm, beautiful place, enjoyed by families. To lose someone to a shark like this is chilling. We are all in shock.” Another witness said he was fishing off rocks when he saw a man wearing a wetsuit swimming across the bay before the horrific attack. “He was yelling at first, and then when he went down there were so many splashes,” the man told the outlet. “It was terrible. I am shaking. I keep vomiting. It’s very, very upsetting.”
