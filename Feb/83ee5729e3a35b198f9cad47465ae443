Seven crooks swiped nearly $500,000 worth of luxury bags and jewelry from an Upper East Side consignment shop this week, cops said. The suspects entered The Real Real on Madison Avenue near East 71st Street around 6 p.m. Sunday, while it was open, police said. They grabbed 17 Hermes bags, two Cartier watches, and an assortment of other watches, rings and jewelry – totaling $498,000 in value, cops said. Workers tried to stop the crew from fleeing, but were unsuccessful, cops said. Surveillance images released late Wednesday show two of the alleged thieves, as well as a white four-door sedan used by at least one of the suspects. Earlier this month, a group stole $48,300 worth of luxury goods from the Celine boutique on Wooster Street — a shop that was targeted by looters in a $1.5 million heist in 2020. Police on Thursday said it’s unknown whether The Real Real incident is connected to a larger theft pattern.
