Tom Thibodeau wouldn’t commit to Knicks point guard Derrick Rose returning in March. The Knicks revealed Rose’s “minor procedure” Friday involved cleaning up a skin infection that developed where he underwent surgery in mid-December to remove a bone spur. Hence, it’s unclear on how invasive a procedure it was amid a report which stated he could be back in two weeks. However, Thibodeau didn’t sound like that timetable was firm. The Knicks said he’s out indefinitely. Asked if he thinks he’ll see Rose back in March, Thibodeau said, “Yeah, I wish I could answer that, but I can’t. Obviously, he needs some time right now and then when he’s re-evaluated, as soon as we get more information, we’ll make sure you guys get updated, as well. You just have to sort of let him go through it and be patient with it.” If the Knicks continue to slide, management will undoubtedly want to switch gears to more development and Rose’s return might be regarded as unnecessary anyway. Rose was on the verge of making his return from ankle surgery this weekend when he needed another procedure because he was feeling “discomfort.” The Knicks are 10 games under .500 and four games out of the 10th seed, which would qualify them for the play-in event. Meanwhile, the Knicks announced they would re-evaluate the impressive rookie shooting guard Quentin Grimes in two weeks after he suffered a dislocated kneecap Friday. Thibodeau sounded like Grimes had dodged a bullet by not needing surgery. According to one source, Grimes, selected 25th overall, still might need a month to recover, and by then, the season could be all but over. “As time goes on, we’ll update as we get more information as well,” Thibodeau said. “But we feel like the fact that there’s no surgery is good.”
