Oops, White House press secretary Jen Psaki did it again, this time blaming the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes on “the hate-filled rhetoric and language around the origins of the pandemic” — meaning, of course, it’s Trump’s fault again. The absurdity is obvious since the prompt for Psaki’s gaslighting was Sunday’s slaying of Christina Yuna Lee in Manhattan. Caught at the scene was homeless career criminal Assamad Nash. This follows last month’s fatal subway-shoving of Michelle Alyssa Go by another drifter, also suffering serious mental illness. Neither perp fits the core “listens to Donald Trump” demographic, to put it mildly. And New York and other left-leaning cities largely let madmen roam free, at most jailing or committing them for a few days before letting them loose again. It’s the same revolving-door treatment for most criminals who don’t have a screw loose — an approach the Bidenites fully support. Psaki’s made a habit of ridiculous answers, whether waving off the supply-chain crisis as “the tragedy of the treadmill that is delayed” or joking about secret late-night flights of illegal migrants, “They’re earlier than you might like.” Her answers — and the larger Team Biden effort to gaslight on everything from inflation to unemployment to their foreign-policy disasters like Afghanistan — may play with the White House press corps. But the lack of real answers (because they have none) is why Biden’s poll ratings keep heading down toward historic lows.
