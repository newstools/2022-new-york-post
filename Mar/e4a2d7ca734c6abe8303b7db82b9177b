It’s a stacked Wednesday NBA slate and Action Network analyst Joe Dellera has three player prop bet predictions to share. Dellera’s player props are spread across two games – the Utah Jazz at the Boston Celtics and the Phoenix Suns at the Minnesota Timberwolves. As for the players he’s targeting, Dellera likes bets on Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, and Rudy Gobert. Beginning with Gobert, Dellera believes there’s value to be had on over 12.5 rebounds against the Celtics. “The Jazz have the second-best rebounding rate in the NBA relative to Boston, who’s in 12th,” Dellera says. Even though Gobert failed to surpass this mark in the first meeting against the Celtics, he only did so by half a rebound. Even including that game, the French big man has cleared this line in 71 percent of games this season. As for the Suns-Timberwolves matchup in Minneapolis, Dellera’s prop plays are as follows: Deandre Ayton over 16.5 points and Devin Booker over 38.5 points + rebounds + assists. In terms of the former play, Dellera’s explanation is that Ayton’s usage in the offense has increased with point guard Chris Paul out due to injury. “[Ayton] has hit the over in seven of his last 10 games and 10 of the last 14 without Paul,” Dellera says. Add in that Ayton posted 22 points in an earlier meeting this season with the Timberwolves and Dellera believes there’s value to be had.  In terms of the Booker points + rebounds + assists prop, Dellera’s reasoning centers around his success recently and against the Timberwolves in general. “[Booker] has gone over this line in seven of the last 10..and has hit this prop in two games against the T’Wolves this season,” Dellera explains.
