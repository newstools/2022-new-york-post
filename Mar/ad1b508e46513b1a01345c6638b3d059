It’s March Madness — literally. Fans at the NEC Championship game between Bryant and Wagner were kicked out of the Chace Atlantic Center on Tuesday night in Smithfield, R.I. after a fight broke out in the stands. The fight occurred in the student section behind the Wagner bench with 4:37 to go and Bryant up 68-32, suspending game play for nearly 30 minutes Bryant ended up winning the game, 70-43, earning the program’s first NCAA Tournament berth. According to NEC Hoops Insider blogger Nelson Castillo, the crowd would have to let Wagner leave the floor before fans could storm the court. The Seahawks (22-5, 13-3 NEC), the No. 2 seed, were the visiting team vs. the Bulldogs (22-9, 15-2 NEC), the top seed in the tournament.
