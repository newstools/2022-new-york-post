A New Jersey teen who was shot in the head by NYPD cops during a Bronx traffic stop has been hit with criminal charges in the case, The Post has learned. Luis Manuel-Monsanto, who remains in critical condition at Lincoln Hospital following the Sunday night shooting, was charged Tuesday with reckless endangerment, fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle, failure to obey a traffic control device and traffic violations, according to law enforcement sources. Manuel-Monsanto, 18, of Clifton, NJ, was struck once in the head when cops said they tried to pull over the Jeep he was driving on Boston Post Road and tried to flee. At one point, police said he backed the vehicle directly at one officer, with two cops opening fire and one striking Manuel-Monsanto. The teenager’s aunt, Daniela Monsanto, told The Post Monday that her nephew grew up in the Bronx and was a sophomore at Cardinal Hayes High School. She faulted the cops for opening fire during the wild encounter. At a press briefing Sunday night, NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey said department policy prohibits cops from opening fire on a vehicle — with exceptions. “The department’s policy is not to shoot at a moving vehicle unless something other than the vehicle is being used as a weapon,” Corey said. “However, there is a carve-out in there that gets reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the first deputy commissioner’s use of force review board.” Two passengers in the vehicle were released after the shooting, and a third was held briefly on an outstanding warrant.
