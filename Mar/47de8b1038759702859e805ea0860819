Bride-to-be Paulina Gretzky is gearing up for her big day. On Tuesday, the future wife of golfer Dustin Johnson shared a series of posts on her Instagram stories chronicling the preparation for the couple’s upcoming nuptials. Joined by mom Janet Gretzky and BFF Kristina Melnichenko, Gretzky and the group appeared to enjoy a food and wine tasting as well as an outdoor tour of what may be the grounds of the venue. Gretzky, 33, and Johnson, 37, are expected to tie the knot at Blackberry Farm in Tennessee, a lavish resort and spa. Gretzky also tagged the event planning company, YSD Events, in Tuesday’s posts. It’s been a busy few weeks for Gretzky, who has been engaged to Johnson since 2013. In late February, the daughter of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky enjoyed a wild bachelorette bash in St. Barths, where Johnson also reportedly had his bachelor party. Gretzky’s bridal party, which includes Melnichenko and future sister-in-law Samantha Maddox — who is married to Johnson’s brother and caddie Austin — checked out hot spots such as Nikki Beach and Bagatelle, according to social media posts. Last week, Gretzky traveled to New York with Melnichenko and Maddox and appeared to check out her wedding dress. She is slated to wear Vera Wang for the big day, previously thanking the prolific designer for crafting the “wedding dress of dreams.” As for Johnson, who shares sons Tatum, 7, and River, 4, with Gretzky, he is readying to compete in this week’s Players Championship.
