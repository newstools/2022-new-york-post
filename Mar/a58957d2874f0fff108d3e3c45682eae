Horrifying video Monday captured a deadly missile strike on a Kyiv city bus that caused it to erupt into a ball of flames. The surveillance video, released by the Kyiv City Council, showed the stationary green bus in a Kyiv intersection around 11 a.m. local time. A bystander in the foreground looks up at the sky, and moments later, the bus explodes from an apparent direct hit. In video shot later and apparently at the scene of the same incident, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko showed a close-up of the mangled bus. The German news outlet Bild reported two dead and nine injured from the strike.
