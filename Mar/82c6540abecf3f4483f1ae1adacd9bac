A bus carrying Ukrainian refugees overturned on a road in northern Italy Sunday, killing a 32-year-old mother. The accident happened around dawn on the highway to Rimini, a town on the Adriatic coast, as the bus headed south to Pescara. The woman’s two children — ages 5 and 10 — suffered bruise​s in the crash, the Associated Press reported, citing Italian media reports, and were taken to the hospital where they received medical and psychological care. Five other people also were injured, none seriously. The bus, with about 22 people on board​, mainly women and children​, landed on its side on a grassy slope just beyond the guardrail near the town of Forli. It had been ​traveling about 20 hours straight after departing western Ukraine. There were no skid marks at the scene, and the cause of the crash is being investigated. “It could have been [the driver] suddenly falling asleep,″ Highway police official Andrea Biagioli told state TV. More than 32,500 Ukrainian refugees have entered Italy since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
