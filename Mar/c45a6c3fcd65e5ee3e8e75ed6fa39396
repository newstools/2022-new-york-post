An Asian straphanger was slashed in the face in an unprovoked attack on the subway in Manhattan Sunday, cops said. The 41-year-old victim was on a northbound J train as it entered the Delancey Street/Essex Street station on the Lower East Side around 8:30 a.m. when a stranger sliced his face with a razor blade, cops said. An NYPD spokeswoman called the attack “unprovoked.” Brendan Dowling, 39, allegedly fled the train at the station, but the victim was able to flag down police who arrested him, cops said. Dowling was charged with assault and tampering with physical evidence, cops said. He allegedly threw the blade onto the roadbed while running away. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force was notified about the attack, a police spokeswoman said. Dowling was last arrested Dec. 16 on criminal possession of stolen property charges after he alleged swiped construction tools from 43 Exchange Place, cops said.
