March Madness stalwart Indiana comes off of a successful First Four game against Wyoming to take on the St. Mary’s Gaels. The ever-popular 5 vs. 12 matchup is a common upset pick for brackets. With Saint Mary’s only two-point favorites and Indiana having played Tuesday, we will see if Indiana is refreshed and ready to play Thursday. The game will start at 7:20 p.m. ET on TBS. According to BetMGM Sportsbook, Saint Mary’s is a -145 moneyline favorite in this contest. Provided by BetMGM Spread: Indiana +2.5 vs. Saint Mary’s -2.5 Moneyline: Indiana +120 | Saint Mary’s -145 Total: Over/Under 125.5  Gametime: 7:20 p.m. est TV Channel: TBS Live Stream: March Madness Live App, Sling TV,  Don’t be fooled by the brand name. Wyoming should have already sent the Hoosiers home. Though Trayce Jackson-Davis was brilliant in the First Four, Indiana wouldn’t have advanced if the Cowboys didn’t commit an uncharacteristic 19 turnovers and freshman Jordan Geronimo didn’t nearly quadruple his scoring average. Indiana enjoys a rock fight, but Saint Mary’s does it better than almost any other team. In its recent win over Gonzaga, it held the best offense in the country to 58 points, while limiting leading-scorers Drew Timme and Chet Holmgren to six points each. When the Gaels force anyone but Jackson-Davis to beat them, Indiana won’t have an answer.
