With increasing pressure from Instagram filters to look a certain way, it’s little surprise that more and more youngsters are on the quest to achieve perfection. But one woman took to TikTok to share her regret at having filler when she was just 20-years-old. Kylie Taylor, who refers to herself as “pillow face,” shared a shocking before and after of her face following years of having filler – and looks almost unrecognizable. Alongside the video, she penned: “I look 10 years older and so puffy and weird looking.” In a second clip, Kylie, who is planning to have the filler dissolved, addressed her followers and explained: “I’m 25 right now.” “The first ever time I got filler was actually in my lips and I got that done at aged 20 or something like that.” The thing is, the industry doesn’t care about your age – they just want money and they’ll ruin your appearance. They don’t really care as long as they get the money.” But I started getting my face stuff couple of years ago, I think I was about 22 or 23, which is way too young – and no-one told me otherwise.” And many were quick to take to the comments section to express their shock after hearing Kylie got filler and Botox so young. “Omg so young,” wrote one. A second commented: “Don’t worry, you still look young and youthful.” Meanwhile, a third penned: “You didn’t need any of that.” A further added: “I can’t believe people age 25 & under are doing this. We actually don’t even start ageing until 25.” Another agreed: “I don’t think you needed any of that at your age people nowadays aren’t even letting themselves grow into their faces.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
