TikTok user Kylie Miner (@catatonicxx) has gone viral reading aloud an Airbnb host’s scathing responses to guest reviews — even mostly positive ones. “Terry” — who is only depicted by her blond bitmoji that has the word “Thanks!” looming atop its head — is a feisty superhost outside Tampa, Florida, and TikTok can’t seem to get enough of her outspoken commentary. One guest, Becky, wrote in February 2021: “The whole cottage could use a bit of sprucing up. That said we couldn’t beat the cost and we were happy with our stay.” Terry wasn’t having it: “This guest wouldn’t know anything about sprucing any home up! They left my sweet vintage clean cottage so dirty it was ridiculous! Very destructive and disrespectful of the home.” Guest Juanita also fell victim to Terry’s retorts — and she was even banned from future stays. “Cute cottage. Hard to find parking,” Juanita wrote last May of the moderately priced stay on Indian Rocks Beach, apparently only leaving three stars on the abode. “Three stars are you serious too bad I gave her a good review,” Terry responded. “Unbelievable how these people don’t mention a word about anything for an explanation of circumstances . . . She’s not welcome back. I consider this lying.” Miner’s posts on Terry have had more than 150,000 views and gained her around 600 followers, she said. “Terry keeps giving me this content, how could I not [keep making videos]?” Miner, a 30-year-old training consultant from Minneapolis told The Post. Miner added that she stumbled upon the viral video fodder on Airbnb when she was planning a trip to the Sunshine State to see a friend in Clearwater some weeks ago. “It looked cute, it looked spunky and it was cheap. But then I went into the reviews and lost my s – – t. I spent all night reading every single one.” Another guest, vacationer Jorge L., who left constructive criticism in his review, was also banned from the beach cottage. “This place is good for a few days, very close to the beach,” he wrote last March. “But this cottage needs remodeling. ASAP. Beds were contable,” he wrote, likely misspelling comfortable. “Yes JORGE didn’t get it this is a vintage original beach cottage it’s not supposed to be remodeled,” Terry responded. “I couldn’t read the rest of what he said . . . person did not make one complaint to me during their stay I can’t believe how people are. He’s not welcome back.” But what really bugged Terry was when guest Ashley alleged there was a roach issue during her stay in the cottage last April. “Our stay had some unexpected cockroaches (what they call palmetto’s) . . . don’t get me wrong the cottage is not filthy, but definitely not cleaned head to toe on a regular basis,” Ashley wrote. “Hopefully terry can clean the place up and take care of this issue,” she added, inadvertently throwing down the gauntlet for a review feud. “This person is delusional . . . That’s such a weird comment this is a tropical place there are bugs everywhere even on the beach!” Terry exclaimed. “She left the cottage filthy it was disgusting and she is never welcome back to any of my cottages. Very delusional experience and quite immature,” she added. Not even polite mothers with small children were safe from Terry’s wrath. “Terry communicated right away prior to and during our stay,” Kasi, who rented the cottage in December 2020, complimented the host. “We enjoyed our stay . . . The place was a little small but worked well since my 4 children are smaller.” “Lots of extra cleaning and food all over the floor with four small children,” Terry responded, prompting commentary from Miner for insulting the family. “So Terry is just b – – ching about these four kids, you wanna talk about unfounded?” the TikToker said, coining the phrase that “her name is Terry and she’s a terry-ble Airbnb host.” Terry did not respond to request for comment through Airbnb.
