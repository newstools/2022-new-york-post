A Mardi Gras celebration turned violent after a mass stabbing outside a popular venue left five people injured. Officials said the fight broke out at around 7.30am on Tuesday at the uptown college bar The Boot. According to police, the incident unfolded after someone was denied entry into the bar and “became violent.” A fight ensued outside the bar as Tulane police were called to the scene. Five people were injured, including at least one student from Loyola University who was working at the bar at the time. A male suspect was taken into custody; however, police have yet to release a name. The male student was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The condition of the other four people was not available. After the stabbing, alerts went out to students at Loyola and Tulane, telling them to avoid the area. “The news of this violence is even more shocking on a day of such joy and community here in New Orleans,” Tetlow said in an email to the Loyola community. “Hold your loved ones close as you celebrate Mardi Gras today, watch out for each other, and be sure to appreciate the good times for the gift that they are.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
