Two people were fatally shot at a birthday party in North Carolina on Saturday, including a 15-year-old boy, according to law enforcement. Deputies from the Robeson County Sheriff’s Office responded to the shooting around around 12:38 a.m. in Pembroke, about 40 miles south of Fayetteville, officials said in a press release. Randi D. Hunt, a 20-year-old woman from Rowland, was declared dead at the scene, cops said. Responders transported the unidentified 15-year-old boy to a local hospital where he was listed in critical condition before later succumbing to his injuries. The county sheriff’s homicide division is investigating the case, however no arrests have been made as of Sunday night. Police said that the suspects “are known” to them, but have not provided any further information. “As with a few previous shootings in this county, we have a crowd of people on scene that witnessed this act that need to come forward with the truth. Detectives have been out all night and are working the case as this release is prepared,” officials said.
