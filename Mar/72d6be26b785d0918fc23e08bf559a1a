When it comes to his downtown New York City condo, this is Gabriel Byrne’s Irish goodbye. Byrne, the famed Emmy-nominated Irish actor whose roles include playing the star shrink in HBO’s “In Treatment,” has sold his two-bedroom perch at 211 Elizabeth St. in Nolita for $5.05 million, according to city Department of Finance records filed Tuesday. The sale comes nearly 12 years after Byrne purchased the unit for $3.36 million, according to April 2010 sales documents and reports published at the time. Hopefully he made the most of his time there. The 1,688-square-foot home also has two bathrooms and the highest ceilings in the 15-unit condominium — ones that reach 11 feet. Even the moldings and cabinetry have fresh coats on paint in creams and white tones, enhancing the natural light that comes in through the unit’s large windows. The home also has a fireplace in the living room, French doors that separate it from the dining/study area and a handsome kitchen with bold wooden accents. Elsewhere, the ensuite master bathroom is clad in marble and room for laundry machines. Building amenities include a gym and a planted roof deck with 360-degree city views. The buyer is listed in the deed as Millers Reagan Holdings, LLC, with an address in affluent Pacific Palisades, Calif. Michaela Morton of Compass had the listing.
