Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani showed up to support his son Andrew’s gubernatorial bid Tuesday, signing a petition for him at the New York Republican Party’s convention on Long Island. “I think I’m saying this not just as a father, but as a person. I’ve been in public life, public office for 50 years. I think I know when people have what it takes to overcome getting weak. He’s got it,” he told reporters in the lobby of the Garden City Hotel while pointing to his son. Giuliani claimed the Republican Party needs an outsider in order to win in deep-blue New York in the fall, claiming the New York GOP leaders had erred in putting their thumb on the scale for Rep. Lee Zeldin. “If Andrew weren’t running, I’d be looking for a candidate from outside politics to beat [Hochul]. I don’t think a professional politician can beat her. And I think what they’re doing with this dictated convention is very damaging, very damaging to the party nationally as well,” said Giuliani. “Well, we’re trying to be … the elite. They’re the ones who dictate. And so what they’ve been doing for a year and a half is dictating.” Asked if he’d like to see his one-time legal client, former President Donald Trump, endorse Andrew’s campaign, the elder Giuliani responded, “I’d like the president being neutral.” “Let the serious candidates battle it out,” he added. The younger Giuliani, who served in the Trump administration, is running against five Republican candidates for the party’s nomination in the November election, when the winner will attempt a longshot campaign to oust Gov. Kathy Hochul. The primary race’s front-runner is Zeldin (R-Long Island). Last month, millionaire GOP businessman and former state comptroller candidate Harry Wilson announced his bid for governor.
