The new Yankee Candle 2022 Scent of the Year is all about finding joy in our everyday lives. After two years of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it’s clear that things will never be the same, but there is always room for optimism. The brand’s fourth annual Scent of the Year candle, called “Inspire,” includes a blend of beautiful scents to make an “intriguing effervescent citrus fragrance that creates a sense of joy while aromas of a salty sea breeze invigorate the senses with optimism.” The highly anticipated candle also celebrates Ikigai, which is a Japanese concept about living a long and happy life. “When developing this year’s fragrance, we really focused on what people are seeking in 2022 and leaned into a scent that celebrates the small moments of joy that can be found in our everyday lives,” Lisa McCarthy, president of the home fragrance business unit, Newell Brands, said in a statement about this year’s Scent of the Year. “Ikigai’s ten rules of happiness, which include ‘reconnect with nature’, helped inspire this bright and energizing, uplifting and radiant fragrance, reflective of what we are all craving right now.” The candle features an intriguing blend of nature-inspired green notes like lime, ginger, verbena, bamboo, freesia, ocean breeze accord, cedar, seaside driftwood and sun musks. The vessel features a creative blue and light green design, that would look great in any space.
