If you think Facebook is creepy, a new site called RealDoll VIP may leave you questioning social media some more. Sex doll fanatics now have a dedicated social media platform for sharing images and ‘tips’. According to Sex Tech Guide, RealDoll VIP is a “sex robot admirer community platform”. Abyss Creations is the US company which made the site and is also behind the popular RealDoll sex doll brand. RealDoll VIP is actually just a revamped version of a platform called Club RealDoll. It’s now a private members-only platform that works in a similar way to Facebook but comes with a fee. Users of the site can keep their identity hidden with random user names. Members send messages, photos and videos to each other. They can even join groups based on their specific ‘sex doll interests’. Users have a profile ‘wall’ where all their posts can be viewed and other members can interact with them. A lot of these functions are similar to Facebook features. A month’s membership to RealDoll VIP costs $29.99. This subscription gives access to “One-of-a-Kind & Factory Second Products” and early access to sex doll sales. Those who sign up for a year pay $12.49 a month. Annual subscribers also get a discount off products and the chance to attend RealDoll’s Annual Gala. They can also access livestreams with RealDoll founder Matt McMullen, Mike Wilson. One of RealDoll’s most popular products is a sex doll called Harmony. A Harmony X doll can cost around $7,999.00.
