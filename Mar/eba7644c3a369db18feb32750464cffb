A creepy stalker hid in a woman’s attic, snuck out at night to film her sleeping and even made copies of her house keys. Mauricio Damian-Guerrero, 20, became obsessed with an OnlyFans model he met online and began tracking her every move. He allegedly acquired the victim’s keys and made copies of them, allowing him to waltz into her property in New Hampshire, USA, whenever he pleased. The 20-year-old then hid in her attic and waited for her to fall asleep, so he could creep downstairs and terrifyingly film her. The victim – identified only as NR – only realised something was wrong when her mother started hearing strange sounds from the attic. According to court documents, Damian-Guerrero entered the 24-year-old woman’s home at least four times. He admitted he had been chillingly planning to install a tracking device on her car as his stalking campaign intensified. Cops arrested him after they found him climbing out of the woman’s attic and onto the roof on February 9. Investigators discovered a string of disturbing clips on his mobile phone that he had taken of the woman as she slept naked. Deputy Strafford County Attorney Emily Garod told WMUR: “He was released with pretty strict bail conditions. “But it is an ongoing concern of ours, the safety of the victim during the pendency of this case, so that is why we asked for him to be held pending trial.” During questioning, Guerrero initially claimed to have broken into the home to retrieve a TV and fireplace that he had previously purchased her as a gift. He also chillingly claimed that the OnlyFans user had “wanted a man to be obsessed with her and stalk her.” Guerrero was charged with four felony counts of burglary, but avoided further punishment. He was released from jail last week and made to wear a tracking bracelet to ensure that he didn’t breach his restraining order.
