Carlos Correa is looking for a home run on the sale of his three-bedroom Houston house. Correa, 27, has listed his 3,657-square-foot Montrose-area manse for $1.59 million — and the offering comes as the former Astros shortstop, and current high-profile free agent, appears to be planning his next steps. The home listed last week, and its listing representative ⁠— Kristi Neal, of C&K Properties ⁠— told The Post she’s been busy with viewings. “We’ve probably had a couple dozen or so,” she said. While there are no offers yet, “we’re starting to have second showings,” she added. The home measures 3,657 square feet, and the Houston Chronicle reports that Correa purchased it in 2017, a couple months before the Astros won that year’s World Series. The two-time All-Star reportedly received a five-year deal from the Astros at the end of last season worth $160 million, but Correa turned it down. He did the same for an offer from the Detroit Tigers, one that would have given him $275 million over 10 years. He’s expecting a contract lasting at least 10 years and $300 million. The 2012-built residence has an open floorplan; an eat-in kitchen with stainless steel appliances and an island that looks out to a dining area and a family room, the latter of which has a gas fireplace. From there, two sliding doors lead to the outdoors, where there’s a covered patio fit with a television and another fireplace. Outside, there’s also a pool, a hot tub and private basketball court. Back inside, the master bedroom has another fireplace, a seating area and a balcony. An upstairs flexible room can hold a home office, a small gym or a media room. Throughout the home, there are four bedrooms and a powder room. The Chronicle notes the estimated 2021 property tax is nearly $25,000.
