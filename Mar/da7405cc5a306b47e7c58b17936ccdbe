Laundry is super tedious – not only is washing clothes time-consuming but folding and putting them away is something almost everyone puts off as much as possible. Well, turns out you won’t spend too long folding your clothes next time because a home expert has revealed how she does it in three seconds. Taking to social media, Carolina Mccauley shared her special folding technique to get it done in a jiffy. According to her video, the first thing you need to do is lay your t-shirt flat on a hard surface. Next, imagine there’s a horizontal line down the middle and grab a hold of the neckline and middle of the shirt. You’ll then grab a hold of the bottom edge of the shirt with the same hand that’s holding the neck and pinch them together. Lift it up, shake it off, and lay it back down, finishing the fold. And that’s it! You’ll have a neatly folded shirt in just a few seconds. And although this may seem super complicated, according to Mccauley’s comment section, it’s really quite easy. One person commented on her video, saying: “This is too advanced for me.” A second one added: “What kind of witchcraft is this?” And a third said: “I did it! Thanks!” And if you’re looking to also cut back on the time you spend drying your clothes, you’ll want to try adding a dry towel to the machine. Mccauley revealed this hack makes her “clean smarter and not harder.” The dry towel absorbs the moisture of the wet clothes and cuts drying time in half. This is especially useful when you’ve got multiple loads to do and don’t want to spend an entire day doing them. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
