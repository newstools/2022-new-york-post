President Joe Biden once again referred to a printed cheat sheet sheet as he doubled down on his unscripted weekend claim that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” On Monday Biden, 79, told reporters he made “no apologies” for his remarks — made off the cuff and not part of his prepared speech in a nationally televised address from Poland Saturday — and did not view it as a provocation to Russia. “It’s more an aspiration than anything. He shouldn’t be in power. There’s no  — I mean, people like this shouldn’t be ruling countries, but they do. The fact is they do, but it doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage about it.” His comments closely aligned with notes printed on a small piece of paper that he was photographed holding in his left hand as he spoke that began as follows: “I was talking to the Russian people. The last part of the speech was talking to the Russian people, telling them what we thought,” Biden told reporters. The president has been photographed several times using a cheat sheet to talk to reporters and voters both in the White House and on the campaign trail. About two weeks before the 2020 election, he pulled notes out of his jacket as he fielded a question about taxes at a Town Hall event. “I carry this card with me,” Biden told the inquiring voter as he repeatedly referenced the notes to recite a litany of dollar amounts and percentages pertaining to his plan to eliminate the tax cuts of former President Donald Trump. Photos showed he used several cheat sheets during his first presidential press conference, including one with the headshots and names of reporters he planned to call on. Biden also utilized notes during a 2021 summit with Putin, while touring the damage of Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and while calling on reporters at the G20 summit in Rome. “I’ll take your questions, and as usual, folks, they gave me a list of the people I’m going to call on,” Biden told the assembled media at the November forum.
