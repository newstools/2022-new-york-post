Let’s be real, getting the proper amount of sleep sets the tone for your whole day. After all, the average American will spend 36 years in bed over the course of their lifetime — but only about 53 percent actually enjoy their bed. The best way to fix that? Investing in a quality mattress and bedding setup to create the best possible sleeping environment. And while mattresses and bedding can get pricey, in honor of Sleep Awareness Week — which started on March 13 and runs through March 20 — dozens of brands are slashing prices on some of their most sought-out options. This annual event, which was created by the National Sleep Foundation, aims to promote better sleep as a way to increase your overall health and well-being. Brands participating in this sale week include Casper, Brooklinen, Allswell, Saatva and more. We’re talking incredible deals on some of the most popular mattresses, plus amazing discounts on luxe sheets, pillows, duvets, throw blankets and even weighted blankets from select retailers.
