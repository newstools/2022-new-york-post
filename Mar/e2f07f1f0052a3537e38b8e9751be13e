Boris Becker, on trial for failing to hand over valuable memorabilia and other assets in his bankruptcy proceedings, says he wishes he still had all of it. Last week, the 54-year-old former tennis star went on trial in London for failing to hand over assets such as two of his Wimbledon trophies — including the 1985 championship that he won at age 17 that made him famous — plus two Australian Open championship trophies and his 1992 Olympic gold medal. “For the player, it’s about winning the title. The trophy is not so much when you are playing,” Becker told the court, according to AFP. “Nowadays I wish I had them to show them to my children.” Regarding the Australian Open trophies, Becker said, “is a big tournament to win it, but what you keep is like this” — and cupped his hands together to show the jury. He continued to refer to the Australian Open trophy as “the smallest” of the grand slams’, and said that other tennis stars “in effect … made fun of them”. Becker, who earned a reported $63 million in prize money and sponsorships, was declared bankrupt in 2017. In addition to the memorabilia, Becker is accused of concealing property and $2.3 million, plus having transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to other accounts, including his estranged wife, Lilly, and his ex-wife, Barbara. If found guilty, Becker faces up to seven years in prison.
