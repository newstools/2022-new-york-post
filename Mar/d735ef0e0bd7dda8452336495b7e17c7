A snow squall in Pennsylvania caused a massive car crash Monday involving dozens of cars and tractor-trailers and leaving at least three people dead. The crash occurred along Interstate 81 in Schuylkill County between exits 116 and 119, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. All lanes were subsequently closed. At least 50 to 60 vehicles were involved in the wreck, which began just before 11:00 a.m., a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Police said. At least three people died, according to the Schuylkill County coroner. More than a dozen motorists were transferred to local hospitals. Video of the crash showed multiple tractor-trailers and cars slamming into each other amid the low visibility. Several vehicles were still on fire in the mid-afternoon as firefighters had to bring in water tankers due to the remote location of the pileup. Snow squalls are associated with strong cold fronts and include sudden and heavy snowfall. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency warned motorists on Monday morning about the possibility of snow squalls throughout the state, saying that they can “turn your visibility to zero in a matter of seconds.” Last month, a 50-car pileup occurred on Interstate 81 roughly 30 miles north of Monday’s wreck. It was also caused by a snow squall, WNEP reported at the time. Schuylkill County is located about two hours west of Philadelphia.
