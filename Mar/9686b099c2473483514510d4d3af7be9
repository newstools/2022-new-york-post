The 2022 MLB regular season will finally get underway on Thursday, April 7. With Opening Day on the horizon and a flurry of the offseason moves in the rear-view mirror, the dust has settled and bettors have a pretty clear picture of where each team stands in terms of the 2022 World Series Odds. It shouldn’t be a surprise to see that bookmakers have installed the Los Angeles Dodgers as the clear favorite to win the World Series at +500. The Dodgers have only failed to make it to National League Championship Series once in the last six seasons, are coming off a 106-win season, and added one of the game’s best hitters (Freddie Freeman) to an already stacked lineup that features Mookie Betts, Max Muncy, Trea Turner, and Cody Bellinger.  At their current odds, bookmakers are implying that the Dodgers win the 2022 World Series roughly 16.7% of the time. The Dodgers are the only team entering the season with single-digit odds, but they have plenty of company at the top of the board, with 11 teams listed between +1000 and +2000. The odds also suggest that the AL East should be an absolute gauntlet as the Blue Jays (+1100), Yankees (+1100), Rays (+1200), and Red Sox (+1800) all carry odds shorter than 20/1. Though not as daunting as the AL East, the NL East also projects to be competitive with the Mets (+1100), Braves (+1200), and Phillies (+3000) all with legitimate hopes of making a run this fall. It’s also clear from looking at the 2022 World Series odds that this season is set up to be a battle between the haves and have-nots. There are 12 teams at 20/1 or shorter and then 10 clubs with triple-digit odds, meaning there are only eight teams in between. As usual, bettors have flocked to the window to back the Dodgers and Yankees, but according to BetMGM’s John Ewing, there’s also been some love for the New York Mets, thanks to some high-profile acquisitions like Max Scherzer and Starling Marte, and the Chicago White Sox. Other sportsbooks have noted that dark horses like the Detroit Tigers, San Diego Padres, and St. Louis Cardinals have attracted notable support in the futures market, as well.
