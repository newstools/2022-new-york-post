It looks the Squad has a Putin problem — as in a reluctance to stand up to the Russian autocrat. Two of the group’s core members, Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) were the only two House Democrats to vote against sanctioning Russia’s oil industry, while Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) in the runup to the invasion argued against providing Ukraine with aid. And, in a now-deleted tweet, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bx./Queens) argued that Washington should “avoid sanctions” against Russia as they would “hurt the Ukrainian people” — inadvertently (we hope) echoing the line pushed by RT, the Russian TV outlet, which similarly insists sanctioning Russia is a “threat to Ukraine too.” Omar is the worst of the bunch (on this front, anyway), as The Post’s Jon Levine reports, because her of her deep family ties to Russia. Her brother-in-law, Mohamed Keynan, was the chief of staff for former Somalian Prime Minister Hassan Khaire, known for “all but giving” (per The Post’s reporting) his country’s oil reserves to the energy company Soma Oil & Gas (backed by Russian billionaire and Putin ally Alexander Djaparidze). And Omar’s father was a Soviet-educated colonel in the Somali army during the ’80s under the Russian-backed regime of Siad Barre. Her excuse for her pro-Putin votes? “I don’t support broad-based sanctions on any country. They are economic warfare, and we should all oppose them like we oppose military actions. Also, as humans who are interconnected to other humans globally, we will directly or indirectly be impacted by it,” Omar tweeted. Funny: Omar loves to sanction Israel. She, Tlaib and the rest champion the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement that targets the Jewish state — never worrying about the impact of sanctions on Palestinians as well as innocent Israelis. That’s the cutting edge of the progressive movement and supposed future of the Democratic Party for you: obsessed with bashing Israel, but cutting a war criminal slack.
