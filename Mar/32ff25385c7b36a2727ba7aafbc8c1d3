Villanova star Justin Moore will miss the rest of March Madness after tests Sunday confirmed a torn right Achilles tendon, the school announced. The Second-Team All-Big East selection and three-year starter was injured Saturday dribbling in the final minutes of Villanova’s win against Houston in the Elite Eight. He is scheduled to undergo surgery this week and will be sidelined indefinitely. “This is a tough blow for all of us, not just because of the great player Justin is but because of what he means to us as teammates and coaches,” Villanova head coach Jay Wright said in a statement. “As one of our captains, Justin has been an integral part of our success. He helps our team in so many ways. Every game, he guards the opponent’s best scorer and is one of the toughest rebounding guards we have had in our time at Villanova.” Moore’s injury shortens an already short rotation. The Wildcats heavily rely on just six players in most games and no one outside of those six has played more than five minutes in any of their last three NCAA Tournament wins. So, Caleb Daniels will slide into the starting lineup and Villanova will try to fight off fatigue and foul trouble to avoid going to the bench too much against Kansas when the two powerhouses meet at 6 p.m. Saturday in the Final Four. Moore, a junior, averaged 14.8 points and 4.8 rebounds in 34.4 minutes per game this season. He was named to the All-South Region Team. “Justin’s work ethic and dedication will help bring him through this recovery,” Wright said, “and we look forward to the day where we see him back on the court fully healthy.”
