A mugger repeatedly slapped a woman in the face and snatched her phone in a Lower Manhattan train station this week, authorities said. The 26-year-old victim had just gotten off a southbound No. 5 train at the Bowling Green station around 4:30 a.m. Monday and was taking an escalator leading to the mezzanine when a man suddenly slapped her multiple times, cops said late Thursday. He then grabbed her iPhoneXR, cops said. The suspect fled down the escalator to the southbound No. 4 train platform, police said. The victim refused medical attention. Police released footage of the attacker, wearing all black and carrying a backpack, swiping into the station. The incident comes amid a slew of recent attacks and robberies on the rails. A panhandler punched a man and stole his wallet at the 42nd Street – Bryant Park station on Wednesday, authorities said. Earlier that day, a group of teens robbed two sleeping men on a Queens train — putting one of them in a headlock, according to police. On March 14, a group of baby-faced suspects pummeled and kicked a 14-year-old boy on the mezzanine of the Van Siclen Avenue train station in East New York — a disturbing caught-on-video attack. And two men pummeled a woman in an unprovoked attack on a southbound A train at Jay Street March 2 — and a man who intervened was assaulted as well, cops said this week.
