Jared Carrabis is leaving Barstool Sports for DraftKings, The Post has learned. Carrabis, a prominent national baseball opinion personality in sports media, had been at Barstool since 2014. Earlier this week, internet sleuths noticed that Carrabis removed Barstool from his Twitter bio, and that his baseball podcast, “Section 10,” was no longer on Barstool’s website. With Barstool as something of an ongoing, surreal reality program, Carrabis’ contract negotiations played out in public last year. Barstool CEO Erika Nardini fielded lobbying pitches from podcaster Kirk Minihane on Carrabis’ behalf, with nothing ultimately getting resolved at the time. Reached for comment by The Post, Barstool founder Dave Portnoy said he was “happy for him.” “Making money matters here now not 10 years down the road,” Portnoy said. “I told him that he should take that offer. I’ll miss him though. But that is our model. Build stars from the ground up and then replace them if they get mega deals.” DraftKings is continuing to make a big push into OTT content in hopes of converting sports media viewers into gamblers on their platform. They recently have added content from ESPN veteran Mike Golic Sr. A DraftKings rep did not respond to a request to comment for this story.
