It’s only a matter of time before the Browns formally say goodbye to Baker Mayfield. Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski couldn’t give a definitive answer about Mayfield’s future at the annual owners’ meetings on Monday. Cleveland shockingly landed Deshaun Watson as its new franchise quarterback earlier this month and the the 26-year-old Mayfield’s status with the team has been up in the air since. “I think we’ll see,” Stefanski said of the Mayfield dilemma. “I think everybody understands the situation. We’re hoping that there’s closure to it at some point.” Mayfield officially requested a trade from the Browns the day before Cleveland announced the Watson trade. The Browns refused to accommodate Mayfield’s request and other teams do not appear to be interested in the 2018 No. 1 overall pick. Many of the teams who needed a quarterback have settled on at least a temporary solution. The Panthers could give Sam Darnold another season to evolve, and in the trade that sent Russell Wilson to Denver, the Seahawks acquired Drew Lock. Those still remain the most likely landing spots for Mayfield, though talks have been moving slowly. Without a team interested in taking on Mayfield, it is possible the Browns release him to end the awkward situation. Watson remains embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal with 22 civil suits and nine criminal sexual assault and harassment accusations from massage therapists. A second grand jury in Texas declined to indict Watson on criminal charges; he has denied the allegations. The Browns signed Watson to a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million deal.
