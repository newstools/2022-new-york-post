A family of four — including a young girl who cried in the arms of US Border Patrol agents — was rescued from the dangerous waters of the Rio Grande while trying to cross from Mexico to Texas, border officials said Wednesday. The family was spotted Monday morning near Del Rio, Texas, struggling in the rapid waters, which were cold in early March, and border agents in an airboat quickly approached them, according to officials and video of the incident. “The children first,” a Border Patrol agent can be heard saying in Spanish in the video, as he directs the parents to hand over the kids, who are 2 and 3 years old. The mother and father are then pulled into the boat. “I can’t emphasize this enough. Crossing the river is extremely dangerous! This year, we’ve already had several people drown (including kids) DON’T DO IT,” tweeted Chief Patrol Agent Jason D. Owens. In just the last week, border agents in the Del Rio area have conducted at least 45 water rescues, says the agency. The family did not need medical care. The parents are Venezuelan citizens and the children are citizens of Panama. The Border Patrol said the family will be processed in “accordance with US Customs and Border Protection policies and guidelines.”
