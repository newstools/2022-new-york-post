Michael Conforto injured his right throwing shoulder diving in a defensive drill in January, slowing down both his workouts and his willingness to sign a contract, his agent, Scott Boras, told The Post. Boras said Conforto had asked him not to negotiate a contract until the outfielder was completely healed. Boras said Conforto returned to hitting five weeks ago and is now back to “his normal swing plane” and working out for teams in Arizona, where Conforto resides. Boras described the injury as a “strain.” Conforto is the most prominent free agent still available from this market. He turned down the $18.4 million qualifying offer from the Mets, a sign that off of a down 2021 season he believed he would find a strong, multiyear contract. But the 2022 season is a week away and still Conforto does not have a home. Boras insisted that Conforto’s market is not being hurt much by the draft compensation tied to a player who turned down a qualifying offer. He said now that Conforto is back doing full workouts there is a robust market for his services. Nevertheless, Boras would not offer a time frame for when Conforto might sign, saying “I am not divine.” Boras did say, “There is a great deal of interest in this guy. We are really just starting the [negotiating] process now that he is swinging normal. … He wanted to have his normal swing plane [before serious negotiations]. Now, he is able to illustrate that with impressive workouts.” Conforto, who turned 29 this month, hit just .232 with 14 homers and a .729 OPS in 2021. He has played for just the Mets, the team that drafted him. But the Mets signed free-agent outfielders Mark Canha and Starling Marte to team with Brandon Nimmo and have not, to date, shown much interest in a reunion.
