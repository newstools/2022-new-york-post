From No. 1 overall pick to last overall quarterback option. After the Browns acquired Deshaun Watson from the Texans, incumbent quarterback Baker Mayfield has been widely expected to be sent out of Cleveland in a corresponding move. But that move has yet to happen – and teams seem to be dropping out by the day. The Colts – who were Mayfield’s choice of destination – traded for former Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan on Monday. Now, the quarterback-hungry Panthers are reportedly out on Mayfield, too. “Despite Twitter reports: I’m told the Panthers are still NOT interested in Baker Mayfield,” FOX Charlotte’s Will Kunkel tweeted. The other quarterback-needy teams all seem to be making their moves. The Saints re-signed Jameis Winston to a two-year deal, while the Falcons signed free-agent quarterback Marcus Mariota. The Texans may not be sold on Davis Mills, but if they wanted Mayfield they would have asked for him in the Watson deal. The only team left that theoretically needs a quarterback is the Seahawks, who acquired Drew Lock when they traded Russell Wilson to the Broncos. So, where does that leave Mayfield? It seems a foregone conclusion that the Browns will move on from him, as the relationship between the two sides has been reported to be at a point of no return. But the lack of interest around the league doesn’t seem to bode well for the Browns as they search for a trade partner. Mayfield struggled to the tune 3,010 yards, 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in 2021 with the Browns, and the team gave up on him by trading for Watson just two years into head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry’s tenure. However, he is a former top pick in the NFL draft, and had good seasons in 2018 and 2020. It’s somewhat surprising that a team like the Panthers – who have no option besides Sam Darnold at the position – haven’t tried acquiring him for a mid-round pick yet. Perhaps he ends up with the Seahawks, but as of right now, his market looks ice cold.
