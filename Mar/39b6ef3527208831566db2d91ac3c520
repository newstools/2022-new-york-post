The Cleveland Browns have some awkwardness on their hands, as they’ve been told no thank you by Deshaun Watson and now must grapple with what to do about Baker Mayfield. Watson’s camp informed the Browns they are out of the market for his services, a team official confirmed to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. A trio of NFC South teams — the Saints, Panthers, and Falcons — have also had meetings with Watson. Multiple reports have indicated that if things got far enough for Watson to meet with a franchise, it means that a team has already agreed on the general framework of a trade with the Houston Texans. Watson has been accused of sexual misconduct by 22 Houston-area massage therapists. Last week, a grand jury in Texas opted not to pursue criminal charges. Watson still faces civil litigation and potential discipline under the NFL’s personal conduct policy. Before these allegations came to light last year, Watson made it clear that he wanted out of Houston. He was deactivated, with pay, for the entire 2021 season as the sexual misconduct allegations were being handled in court. The Browns’ quarterback situation for next season is murky. There is the general awkwardness of trying to woo a replacement for Mayfield, whose performance lagged this past season amid a shoulder injury. Mayfield already published what appeared to be a cryptic farewell note to the city of Cleveland, and a Browns official leaked to ESPN’s Chris Mortensen that they want an “adult” at quarterback — a shot at Mayfield that at least one decision-maker there feels he’s not one. NFL Media’s Mike Garafolo reported Thursday that the Browns still view Mayfield as the starter. That scenario would certainly require some reconciliation. The NFL quarterback carousel still has lots of spinning left to do.
