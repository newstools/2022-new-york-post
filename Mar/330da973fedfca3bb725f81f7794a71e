The Giants are going to have to try to find offensive linemen wherever they can, given their salary cap constraints heading into next week’s start of NFL free agency. They made a move in that direction on Wednesday, signing Matt Gono to a one-year contract. Gono, 25 and born in Cinnaminson, N.J., was released in late January by the Falcons, making him available to be signed before the market opens on Monday. The Giants only had five offensive linemen on their roster before the move. Gono was undrafted out of Wesley College in 2018 and spent four years with the Falcons, playing in 21 games, including four as a starter. He lined up at left guard and right tackle. Last season, Gono spent the entire year on the physically unable to perform list with a shoulder injury. Prior to last year, the Falcons placed a second-round tender on Gono as a restricted free agent, an indication that he he seemed to be part of their future plans. The Giants have nine picks in next month’s NFL Draft, including Nos. 5 and 7 overall, and are expected to take offensive linemen early and perhaps often.
