The four U.S. Marines killed during NATO exercises in Norway last week have been brought home. The remains of Capt. Matthew J. Tomkiewicz, Capt. Ross A. Reynolds, Gunnery Sgt. James W. Speedy and Cpl. Jacob M. Moore were escorted by members of their squadron to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where they landed on Friday, a Marines public information officer told The Post. They arrived in Delaware from Bodo, Norway, where members of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 261 held a ramp ceremony in “the early morning hours” of Friday. Hundreds of Marines and sailors, plus NATO service members, saluted as the men were loaded onto an Air National Guard C-130. The four Marines were reported missing the evening of March 18, after their MV-22B Osprey failed to return from a training mission. They were later recovered from a crash site in the Arctic Ocean. Their bodies will be transferred to their final resting places in accordance with their families’ desires.
