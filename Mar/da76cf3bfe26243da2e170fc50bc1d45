Former President Donald Trump “more likely than not” attempted to illegally obstruct Congress on the day of last year’s Capitol riot, a California federal judge ruled Monday. “Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” US District Judge David Carter wrote in a ruling ordering attorney and Trump ally John Eastman to turn over more than 100 emails to the House select committee investigating the riot. Carter cited the 45th president’s repeated efforts to have then-Vice President Mike Pence throw out the results in several contested states, which Pence insisted he did not have the authority to do. In his ruling, Carter ruled that the joint session at which lawmakers heard and counted the results of the 2020 Electoral College vote constituted a “‘lawful function of government’ … which Dr. Eastman does not dispute.” The court did not come to a conclusion on whether the former president “likely engaged in common law fraud.” The Electoral College vote count was interrupted for hours after supporters of Trump rampaged through the Capitol, causing damage and attacking police officers. One person, Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer as she attempted to enter the Speaker’s Lobby.
