Jeff Passan has apologized for remarks he made on a podcast in which he characterized MLB owners’ final offer to players before canceling the season’s first week of games as a “s–t sandwich.” Appearing on Pablo Torre’s podcast, the ESPN MLB insider said, “I looked at the offer the next morning and I texted a few players and I texted a few agents and I said to all of them, ‘Are you really going to take this s–t sandwich?’ ” Passan, in a statement to The Post provided by an ESPN spokesperson, said that he had intended to attribute the phrase to a source, but mistakenly neglected to do so. “On a podcast recently, I took the phrasing of a source and mistakenly did not make clear they were his words, not mine,” Passan said. “ESPN and fans rightfully expect me to be objective, and my record shows I’m extremely committed to representing all sides of a story. In this instance, I fell short of that standard.” ESPN also issued a statement on the matter. “We’ve addressed the situation with Jeff directly and as you can see from his statement, he understands his mistake,” an ESPN spokesperson said. “We fully trust that going forward he will cover this important and sensitive topic in a fair manner.”
