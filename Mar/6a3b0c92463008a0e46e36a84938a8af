Pandering to rank ignorance, Mayor Eric Adams is leaving the school-mask mandate in place for children under 5 — who face utterly trivial risk from COVID, and significant risk of learning failure from masking. In the entire rest of the world, next to no one ever made toddlers mask at all — and the kids were fine. In the 46 states in the American Academy of Pediatrics database, from zero to 0.01% (that’s one in 10,000) of all child COVID cases resulted in death, and those few overwhelmingly involved serious complicating factors. The total US death toll for all under-18s in nearly two full years of the pandemic is below 800. Yes, the CDC still advises school masking for the un-jabbed, and kids 5 and under can’t get vaxxed. But the CDC is plainly being anti-science here: The World Health Organization was never this hyper-cautious, nor (again) was the rest of the world. And facial signals are crucial to small children’s development. Yes, some misled parents may fear for their little ones, and resist sending tots to schools without mask rules. But they’ll learn soon enough that it’s safe. The question is — when does this all end? Pfizer already has found that its vaccine is less effective for those 5-11, and doing the testing for those under 5, much less getting FDA approval, is moving at a glacial pace. Are we really going to wait until vaccines are allowed for babies before we let the kids go maskless? If Adams is deferring to his health professionals here, he needs to find new ones. Continuing this mandate only harms the most vulnerable.
