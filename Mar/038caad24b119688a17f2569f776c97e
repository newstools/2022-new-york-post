Travis Kelce’s girlfriend Kayla Nicole couldn’t help but do a happy dance when she reunited with the Chiefs tight end after attending Brittany Matthews’ bachelorette party last weekend. The model and fitness entrepreneur shared a cute clip with Kelce, 32, on her Instagram Story this past Tuesday during an elevator ride, which she captioned, “Reunited.” Kayla held her phone up to Kelce’s face to film the Super Bowl champion, who playfully walked away, laughing. She danced for a moment before skipping out of the elevator wearing a black top and shorts. It’s unclear where the two were at the time. Kayla just returned from Matthews’ bachelorette party, which kicked off last Thursday at an undisclosed beach location. Matthews is set to marry Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes sometime in 2022. Kelce attended Mahomes’ bachelor party that same weekend in Las Vegas — which included their Kansas City teammates Jerick McKinnon, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and Orlando Brown. Last month, Kayla paid tribute to Kelce in a post on Instagram, after his season ended in a 27-24 loss to the Bengals in the AFC Championship game. Kelce has been dating Nicole since 2017. The couple briefly split in the summer of 2020, and later got back together that December.
