A company accused of bilking costumers out of tens of thousands of dollars for PlayStations and Xboxes that were never delivered for the Christmas holidays in 2020 must now pay restitution, a judge ruled Monday. New York Attorney General Letitia James in December persuaded a judge to freeze the bank accounts of New Jersey business Prestigious Marketing Concepts, Inc — also known as Sonjia Posh Boutique LLC — so that it couldn’t carry out the same alleged scam again. On Monday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Laurence Love ruled the company — owned by Tandria Faulkner — “shall pay full restitution to consumers who have been harmed.” The judge also ordered the company to turn over a list of all the customers who placed orders so that they can receive the refund. And it must put up $100,000 bond before it can resume doing business to ensure there are enough funds for the restitution payments, the order said. James’ December lawsuit accused the company of taking $500,000 worth of orders for soon-to-be-released gaming consoles in the fall of 2020 promising many they would be delivered by Christmas time. But when orders failed to arrive the company allegedly gave many buyers the run-around when they asked for refunds, the AG alleged. The company posted online ads for the gaming systems showing photos of stacks of boxes of consoles to trick customers into believing they were stocked up on the hard-to-come-by electronics, the AG alleged. “This is a big win for consumers who were gamed out of Xboxes, PlayStations and other high-end products they paid for but never received,” James said in a prepared statement. A lawyer for Faulkner and the company didn’t immediately return a request for comment.
