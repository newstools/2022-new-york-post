Roseanne Barr has sold her longtime California home for $3.1 million — $400,000 less than she was initially asking for, The Post has learned. Barr purchased the more than 4,500-square-foot El Segundo abode for $1.17 million in 2003. In the nearly 20 years she has held onto the home, the property went on the rental market twice. The Mediterranean-style manse’s four bedrooms and four bathrooms have seen several updates — including a newly installed smart-home system and an elevator. Amenities include a sauna and a game room with views of the coastline, the previous listing stated. Meanwhile, it appears Barr, 69, has since downsized to a much smaller home in the West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. Spanning only 1,600 square feet, Barr purchased this home last summer for $1.3 million, and listed her larger El Segundo residence three months later. The one-story property has three bedrooms and two bathrooms — and boasts an open floor plan. Outdoor features include a large pool surrounded by mature fruit trees, a terraced vegetable garden with a sprinkler system and a covered patio seating area, the listing notes. Sangyon Chun of Rodeo Realty held the listing; James Pentland and Sam Plotkin of the Passman Group repped Barr. Barr, who spends most of her time on a 46-acre macadamia nut farm in Hawaii, also holds two other Southern California homes in the El Segundo neighborhood, and one in the seaside Playa Del Rey community. But it seems these fairly modest houses (by celebrity standards) are left to her five children. It is unclear whether her latest purchase is also for her kids or is being used as an investment property. The Post has reached out to Barr’s rep for comment.
