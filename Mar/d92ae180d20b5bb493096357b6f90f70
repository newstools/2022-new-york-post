“Wings” and “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” actress Farrah Forke has died. She was 54. A friend confirmed to Variety Wednesday that she passed away Feb. 25 in her Texas home from cancer. “Farrah was fierce, tender, loyal, loving, strong, funny, smart, protective, kind, passionate and utterly irreplaceable,” they said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. “She brought a light so great to the world that even after her passing, the light remains.” Forke starred in Seasons 4, 5 and 6 of the NBC sitcom. The show aired from 1990 to 1997 and was created by legendary “Cheers” and “Frasier” writers David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee. She portrayed Desert Storm veteran and helicopter pilot Alex Lambert. She was the love interest of characters Joe (Tim Daly) and Brian Hackett (Steven Weber). She later starred as lawyer Mayson Drake on Season 2 of “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.” She appeared on other iconic projects such as “Ned and Stacey,” “Mr. Rhodes,” “Party of Five,” “Disclosure,” “Heat” and “Batman Beyond.” Forke was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and later moved to Manhattan to study at the prestigious Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. Once she became a parent to her twin sons, Chuck and Wit Forke, she took a step back from Hollywood. Forke is also survived by her mother and stepfather, Beverly and Chuck Talmage, as well as her three sisters, Paige Inglis, Jennifer Sailor and Maggie Talmage. A private funeral service was held for her by close family, friends and loved ones. Her family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the American Cancer Society.
