For her new film, Sandra Bullock found herself in a hairy situation acting around quite the Magic Mike-stand. The seasoned actress redefined “testicular fortitude” after revealing how she managed to stay focused while “face to face” with Channing Tatum’s manhood in their new flick “The Lost City.” “He’s stupid naked in this film, stupid,” the 57-year-old Oscar winner exclaimed while dropping salacious bombshells during a Monday appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” “When you’re down there, you may as well just get to know it,” the “Gravity” star told Colbert of her brand of manhood method acting, People reported. Referencing an NSFW scene in which her character examines her 41-year-old co-star’s tallywacker for leeches, Bullock explained: “[I’m] fully there. Full-on face to face, with the, uh … landscape.” “I had to spend some time down there, just making sure no leeches, and I had a lot to say to it,” the Virginia native added. Fortunately, the “Blind Side” star said she was able to remain calm in the danger zone. “When you’re down there, and you have two pages of dialogue, if you are looking directly at it, you will get nothing done,” Bullock described. “So I looked at his left thigh. I focused more on the left inner thigh.” Tatum recounted filming the steamy scene in a behind-the-scenes special. “Walking to set with a bunch of leeches Super-Glued to my butt and not having met everybody and just kinda being like, ‘OK, I’m gonna be butt-naked,’ ” said the “Magic Mike XXL” actor. “And then, not only that, but to have Sandra Bullock have, like, a two-page monologue with, uh, a certain part of my body.” “The Lost City” — which also stars Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt — hits theaters on March 25. Oscar-winning actress Bullock recently revealed that she took a hiatus from acting to spend more time with her son, Louis, 12, and daughter, Laila, 10. “I just want to be 24/7 with my babies and my family,” she said. “That’s where I’m gonna be for a while.”
