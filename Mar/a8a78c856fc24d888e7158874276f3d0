This mind-bending optical illusion has left people baffled — with viewers not knowing if the circles or arrows are moving. The image, created by Japanese Twitter user Jagarikin, has left thousands scratching their heads. A GIF shows dark grey arrows on a grey background, surrounded by colourful wheels. Each time arrows appear, the circles seem to move in that direction. Thousands of people on social media, who can not figure out how it works, have been left scratching their heads. One man wrote on Reddit: “I don’t get it. What doesn’t move? I don’t see anything changing positions… the arrows change, rotate every few seconds, add smaller arrows…. But nothing is moving except the colour rings.” Another on Twitter said: “I have zero idea what is happening here. My brain has turned to mush.” However, others seem to have cracked the mystery and have been explaining how the illusion works. One person said: “It’s the inner and outer edges of the circles that create the illusion of movement. “The colours of the edges are off-time with the colour of the core, and depending on how off time they are and where, that creates the illusion of movement.” Another explained: “It’s very clever, using the timing difference between the colouring of the edges and the colouring of the core to create the illusion of movement. “If you pause the illusion and look closely at the edges, you’ll see what I mean.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
