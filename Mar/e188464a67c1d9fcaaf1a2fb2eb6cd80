No, you aren’t getting “Rickrolled.” New Kids on the Block are going back on tour, with Rick Astley, En Vogue and Salt-N-Pepa to complete the bill. To promote the summer concerts, they created some ’80s nostalgia and released “Bring Back the Time,” complete with a music video on Thursday featuring the entire ensemble of groups on the Mixtape Tour. Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block co-wrote and co-produced the new track, which pays homage to the ’80s when the band was at their prime. The upbeat dance-pop tune serves as an opportunity to re-create the most iconic scenes from a collection of MTV videos, including “Whip It,” “Rebel Yell,” “Addicted to Love,” “Vogue,” “We’re Not Gonna Take It” and more. While most of the music videos predate the musicians, they are, nevertheless, still a visual ode to the most influential tunes of the ’80s. The music video for the song, which is about “bringing back” the good ol’ days, shows the singers in 2022 donning flowerpots and Twisted Sister wigs, rocking the ‘fits they would have fashioned for themselves back in their day. The YouTube video has more than 23,000 views and 4,000 likes since it was posted Thursday, with many commenters saying it made them crack a smile. “OMG, this is hilarious, the characterizations are on point, and the message comes right through … Bring back the time,” wrote one user. “This is wonderful! All of the 80’s vibes!” chimed in another. “If you feel old, it’s because you knew who every one of those groups were that they were acting out,” joked a fan. The Mixtape Tour begins May 10 in Cincinnati and is slated to play dozens of venues around the country before ending in Washington, DC, on July 23.
