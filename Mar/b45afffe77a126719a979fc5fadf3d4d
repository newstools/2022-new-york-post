That’s one smooth sale. American guitarist Carlos Santana has sold the smaller of his two Hawaii properties for a cool $11.9 million. It would appear the other one better suits his mood. The freshly sold four-bedroom home is located on the island of Kauai, according to Neal Norman’s Hawai’i Life listing for the spread. “This incredible home brings modern, resort style living to one of the finest locations on Kauai,” the listing says. While the 4,003 square feet of living space may seem humble compared to other luxury listings, there’s a whopping 131,595 square feet — or a little over 3 acres — of land, and nearly every room in the house features enviable views of the ocean and surrounding landscape. There’s also a private gated area atop a bluff overlooking the waters of Anini Beach, a covered entryway and both indoor and outdoor dining and entertainment areas. (The home’s “pod” design makes going between those two “seamless.”) From the “master pavilion” on the eastern side of the house, there are views of the Kilauea Lighthouse; on the other side of the breezeway to the west, the ocean is visible from three additional bedrooms. There is central air and hardwood floors throughout, an infinity-edge, in-ground pool and spa, an outdoor bar and kitchen, and fruit tree landscaping. The property is also located at “elevation above tsunami and flood zones” the listing briefly reassures. The address is both conveniently located to Anini Beach’s protected waters down the hill and a host of resort amenities a short drive away in the town of Kilauea. Santana, 74, primarily lives in Las Vegas. He originally listed this home for $12.9 million in 2021, in the same time frame in which he bought a larger Hawaii property for $20.5 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.
