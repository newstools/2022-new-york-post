“What keeps you going?” Ra’Shad James is seated at the podium inside Protective Stadium’s press conference room, fielding questions from a handful of local reporters. It is November 1, 2021 — media day for the Birmingham Squadron, a new NBA G League organization affiliated with the New Orleans Pelicans. The event marks the official start of the season. For James, a journeyman guard originally from New York, it is Year 9 of his extraordinary professional career. So, what keeps him going? “The love,” he says. “The love for the game. If I wake up one morning and I don’t want to go to practice, or I don’t want to work out on my own, I think that’s when it’s time to hang it up. But I’m not waking up [like that], my back’s not hurting, my knees are good. So yeah, I got a lot left in the tank.”
