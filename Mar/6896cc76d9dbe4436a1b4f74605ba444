Certain Jergens Ultra Healing Moisturizers have been recalled over fears that they could be contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria. Select units of Jergens moisturizer “could show the presence of Pluralibacter gergoviae a bacterium which typically poses little medical risk to healthy people,” according to the recall notice posted by the Food and Drug Administration. Consumers with weakened immune systems could be “more susceptible to infections,” according to the recall. Kao USA Inc., which issued the voluntary recall, said only certain lots of 3- and 10-ounce bottles are affected, according to officials. Consumers are urged to stop using it “as a precautionary measure,” according to the recall. Officials are still trying to “determine the scope of the issue.” As a precautionary measure, Kao removed the recalled product from warehouses. The company also said it was working with retailers to make sure the product is no longer on store shelves and that it is proactively notifying customers. “Kao USA cares about our consumers’ safety,” the company said in a statement. “We are committed to manufacturing products that not only meet, but exceed, the highest industry standards.” The company says it’s working with its partners “on improved cleaning and sanitization practices so that similar issues can be prevented in the future.”
