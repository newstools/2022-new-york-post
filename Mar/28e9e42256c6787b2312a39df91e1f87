The Islanders will be without two of their stalwarts for the foreseeable future. Cal Clutterbuck will miss the rest of the season with a shoulder injury that requires surgery, the team announced Thursday morning. Scott Mayfield will also be out 4-6 weeks — essentially the remaining length of the season — with a lower-body injury. Clutterbuck, who signed a two-year contract extension on Monday, had missed the prior two games with what the team had termed maintenance, and Mayfield had played every game this season. No corresponding roster moves were announced as of Thursday morning. The 27-25-9 Islanders play Detroit on Thursday night.
