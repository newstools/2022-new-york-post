Mayor Eric Adams promised Friday that he would take his campaign against gun violence national during a press conference with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the Windy City, which has been hit hard by a surge in homicides and shootings. “We need help from Washington, DC. We need to staff the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] appropriately. We need to do information sharing. We need to focus on those illegal gun manufacturers that are producing these guns that are proliferating our cities,” Hizzoner told reporters there. “I’m gonna visit all my mayors across this country that get it.” Adams later added that he would be “going to travel throughout the country and see what others are doing” when it comes to tackling gang and gun violence. The trip comes the same week his NYPD finally rolled out the first plainclothes squads targeting gun and gang violence, a key but much delayed part of Adams’ plan to combat violence here. There were 488 murders in the five boroughs in 2021, up 53 percent from the 319 reported in 2019 before the pandemic struck. However, that’s just a fraction of the 800-plus murders reported in Chicago in 2021.
