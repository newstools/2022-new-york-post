A mind-blowing 3D reconstruction has revealed what a Stone Age woman looked like 4,000 years ago. It’s now on display at Västernorrlands Museum in Sweden and is based on skeletal remains that were found in 1923. The remains of the Stone Age woman were found next to the body of a seven-year-old boy who may have been her son. Scientists have reconstructed her after all this time and designed her expression as if she was watching over her child. According to LiveScience, Oscar Nilsson, the Sweden-based forensic artist who worked on the model, explained: “With our eyes and perhaps in all times, you tend to think that this is a mother and son. “They could be. Or they could be siblings: sister and brother. They could be relatives, or they could just be tribe friends. “We don’t know, because the DNA was not that well preserved to establish this relationship.” Forensic details suggest that the Stone Age woman died in her 20s or early 30s. She had been laid to rest in a stone coffin. Her remains didn’t show signs of injury or diseases. At 4 feet, 11 inches she wasn’t very tall and was a similar height to the child she was buried close to. A copy of the ancient woman’s skull was made using a 3D printer and several factors such as age, weight and height were used to conjure up a realistic face. Her brown hair and eye color was an educated guess. It’s likely she was a farmer and a hunter-gatherer. Swedish archaeologist Helena Gjaerum designed the woman’s clothes. Animal skins were slathered in moose brains to soften them and prevent rotting. This is said to be a traditional technique. Gjaerum made sure the Stone Age woman’s clothes were realistic and as practical as possible. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
