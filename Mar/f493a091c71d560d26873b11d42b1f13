Though the pandemic forcing many of us to work from home has had a few perks (answering emails in bed, anyone?), it also has its drawbacks, too. From a loneliness epidemic to making us more sedentary and taking away our daily commutes, it’s likely our mental and physical health have suffered over the last two years. If sitting too long everyday has you looking for a way to loosen the tight areas in your body at home, the Stamina InLine Back Stretch Bench with Cervical Traction can help. And right now, this game-changing device can be yours for $30 off at just $169.99. Though it can be nice to work from your couch and stay in comfy clothes all day, being sedentary is bad for the human body and sitting still for long periods of time is dangerous. The Stamina InLine Back Stretch Bench with Cervical Traction lets you stretch and loosen those tight and problematic areas building up in your body — from your neck and back to your hips and knees — thanks to the power of decompression. And the InLine Back Stretch Bench lets you get that decompression and proper traction without the need for a fancy inverting machine. Decompression helps reduce pain in your body, while also reducing the chances of future injuries, allowing you to get a deep stretch. And this stretch bench is equipped with eight upgraded foam rollers that give you a deep massage and some serious lower back relief, while the traction therapy enhances traction and provides you a deeper stretch. Let the head support strap hold your back and neck in place as you decompress on the wide, upholstered comfy bench. A height adjustment knob lets you fit the bench to your desired length, while foam-padded arm supports adjust between three positions. Give your body some much needed relief with the Stamina InLine Back Stretch Bench with Cervical Traction, now just $169.99. Prices subject to change.
