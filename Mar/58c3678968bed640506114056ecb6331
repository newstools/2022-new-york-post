Far-left Rep. Ayanna Pressley apparently praised Will Smith in a tweet for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars in defense of his wife — before quickly deleting the eyebrow-raising tribute. “#Alopecia nation stand up! Thank you #WillSmith Shout out to all the husbands who defend their wives living with alopecia in the face of daily ignorance & insults,” the lawmaker, who also suffers from the autoimmune condition that causes hair loss, tweeted, according to The Hill. The Massachusetts Democrat, a member of “The Squad,” also added: “Women with baldness are for the real men only only [sic]. Boys need not apply.” Shortly before winning the Oscar for Best Actor, Smith accosted Rock for joking about Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head. Pinkett Smith has previously spoken out about having alopecia. “Jada, I love you, ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it,” Rock said, referring to the 1997 flick starring a shaven-headed Demi Moore trying to join the special forces. Smith slapped the famously acerbic comedian and twice yelled, “Keep my wife’s name out of your f–king mouth.” Pressley, who later deleted the tweet seeming to condone the violent outburst, revealed her condition in 2020, according to the outlet. “In the fall, when I was getting my hair retwisted, is the first time that I was made aware that I had some patches,” she said. “From there, it accelerated very quickly. “I’m very early in my alopecia journey. But I’m making progress every day. And that’s why I’m doing this today,” Pressley said. “It’s about self agency. It’s about power. It’s about acceptance. It’s so interesting to me that right now on this journey, what I feel the most unlike myself is when I am wearing a wig. So I think that means I’m on my way,” she added, according to The Hill.
