TAMPA — Rachel Balkovec’s historic day will have to wait. The new manager for the Yankees Low-A Tampa affiliate, promoted to the position this past offseason, was scheduled to become the first woman to manage a game in affiliated baseball when Tampa opens its spring training schedule on Thursday, but Balkovec was struck in the face by a batted ball during a hitting drill on Tuesday. While she didn’t suffer a concussion, Balkovec is still undergoing tests and has been advised by doctors to rest for the next five to seven days. “All things considered, I feel very fortunate,” Balkovec said in a statement the team released Wednesday. “The doctors have asked me to be smart about limiting my activities over the next several days, and I plan on following their guidance. As much as I already miss being around the players and staff, I do not anticipate this affecting my role and responsibilities for the regular season.” Tampa, whose roster is expected to include Jasson Dominguez, is scheduled to open their regular season in Lakeland on April 8. The 34-year-old previously served as a minor league hitting instructor for the Yankees. “She’s carved out her own path,’’ Aaron Boone said. “She’s worked hard to get to where she is. I’m sure she’s more than ready for this. I’ve shared with her that I’m here as a sounding board.
