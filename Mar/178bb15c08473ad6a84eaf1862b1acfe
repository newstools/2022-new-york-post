Texas A&M receiver Demond Demas is facing a charge of assault/family violence following an arrest and accusation of assaulting his girlfriend, per multiple reports. The Houston Chronicle reports that the charge against Demas stems from an incident that allegedly occurred on Saturday. A probable cause affidavit states that Demas’ girlfriend alleged that he “pushed her head into a wall” and threw her off a bed after she bit him in the shoulder. That reportedly caused her top front teeth to go through her bottom lip. She suffered bleeding, loose teeth, swelling and a hole to the bottom of the lip, per the report. Demas, a former five-star recruit, was released from custody on Wednesday. He has been suspended by the university and is not currently a member of the football program. He was also reportedly accused of hitting a girlfriend last year, though the Brazos County district attorney’s office declined to press charges following an investigation, per the Chronicle. Demas was also arrested for marijuana possession in March 2021. Demas had 15 receptions for 235 yards as a redshirt freshman last season.
