Goth girl icon Christina Ricci has joined the cast of “Wednesday,” the Tim Burton-directed “Addams Family” spinoff series coming to Netflix. Ricci, 42, was rumored to replace Thora Birch in an unnamed role following the latter’s untimely exit from the show last year, Deadline reported on Monday. The publication said that Ricci is already filming in Romania, where production is expected to wrap at the end of the month. Ricci is often remembered for her role as Wednesday Addams in Barry Sonnenfeld’s 1990s franchise “The Addams Family.” In Burton’s new supernatural series, written by “Smallville” creators Al Gough and Miles Millar, the “Yellowjackets” star will be a series regular and play an entirely new character in the Addams family tree, according to Deadline. The Post has reached out to Ricci’s representatives for comment. Fans themselves pushed for Ricci’s casting with a viral petition last year that called for cinema’s original Wednesday Addams to take part. The new live-action “Wednesday” follows the titular teenage outcast, played by 19-year-old “Scream” actress Jenna Ortega, through her years at Nevermore Academy. Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, assumed the role of Addams matriarch Morticia, alongside Luis Guzmán, 65, as her husband Gomez. In 1999, Ricci was cast opposite Johnny Depp, 58, in Burton’s folklore horror film “Sleepy Hollow.” Doing what she does best, Ricci plays the potentially psychopathic, yet inexplicably disarming Misty in Showtime’s breakout thriller “Yellowjackets,” which also features Juliette Lewis, 48, and New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, 44.
