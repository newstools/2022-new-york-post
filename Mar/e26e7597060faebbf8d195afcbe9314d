The writing was on the wall for Carson Wentz’s tenure with the Indianapolis Colts, and now the quarterback will be playing in a new city. Wentz has been traded to the Washington Commanders for a second- and third-rounder in the 2022 NFL Draft and a third-rounder in 2023 that can go up to a second-round pick if Wentz plays 70 percent of the snaps, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. ESPN reported around the Super Bowl that Wentz was likely done with the Colts after one season, and head coach Frank Reich and GM Chris Ballard were both noncommittal at the time as to whether the quarterback would return in 2022. The Colts dropped their final two games of the season to fall to 9-8, including a season finale against Jacksonville in which they were double-digit favorites and would have made the playoffs had they won. Because Wentz played 75 percent of the Colts’ snaps this past season, the Colts owe the Eagles a first-round pick for the trade last offseason. NFL Network reports the Colts are now expected to be among the teams pursuing the 49ers’ Jimmy Garoppolo.
