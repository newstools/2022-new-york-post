Juli Boeheim — the wife of Syracuse University’s men’s basketball coach, Jim Boeheim — was robbed at gunpoint Tuesday afternoon in the parking lot of Destiny USA (a shopping mall), according to Syracuse.com. The robbery was reported at 2:08 p.m., when a male “youth” approached Boeheim while she was sitting in her car near a Cheesecake Factory entrance, the Syracuse Police Department said in a news release. The male talked with Boeheim before pointing a gun at her, reaching into her car and grabbing her purse, according to police. The youth and two others drove away from the scene in a nearby car that had been reported stolen, according to Onondaga County 911 dispatch reports. Boeheim was not injured in the armed robbery incident, and the investigation is ongoing. According to WHAM-TV, an ABC news affiliate in Rochester, another armed robbery took place at the same Cheesecake Factory last week. Boeheim’s husband coached Syracuse in the Orange’s 88-79 overtime loss at North Carolina on Monday night. The couple, which shares four children, met in 1994 at the Kentucky Derby and were married three years later, according to TMZSports.com. They are well known in the Syracuse community for their charitable efforts outside Boeheim’s basketball success. Boeheim took over as head coach at Syracuse in 1976. He was the Naismith College Coach of the Year in 2010, and was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005.
