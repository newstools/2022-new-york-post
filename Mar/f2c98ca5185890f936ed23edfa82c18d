Police shot a driver in the head during a traffic stop in the Bronx on Sunday night after he backed his vehicle toward an officer in an attempt to flee, the NYPD and sources said. Officers in two seperate unmarked police cars tried to pull over the driver of the black Jeep on Boston Road and East 165th Street after he blew several red lights at about 8 p.m., Chief of Department Kenneth Corey said at a Sunday night press briefing. The first cop car, with its warning lights on, pulled ahead of the Jeep while the second police vehicle came up behind the SUV, Corey said. “As the officers exited their vehicle, the Jeep backed up and sped directly towards one officer who discharged his weapon at the vehicle striking the driver,” said Corey. Police said the driver was taken to Lincoln Hospital in critical condition. Two officers were hospitalized for observation. Three other occupants of the Jeep were taken into custody, sources said. Corey said the shooting was captured on a police body camera and the videos are being reviewed.
