On Feb. 10, Aaron Rodgers said he will enjoy the “next couple of weeks,” then do “some quick contemplating” and make a decision “pretty quick.” Twenty-two days later, the decision has not been as quick as advertised and might be more difficult than Rodgers expected. According to NFL Network, the longtime Packers quarterback is “truly torn” on where he wants to play next season and is “going back and forth on what he wants.” It is possible that a complicating factor is not just whether to leave Green Bay but which destination would be best if he did. According to Pro Football Talk, Rogers has lined up three possible next teams: the Broncos, Titans and Steelers — although there is some uncertainty about the details. ESPN reported Saturday that the Packers have not engaged in any trade scenarios with Rodgers and are awaiting his decision about whether he wants to return to Green Bay for an 18th season. Pro Football Talk, though, reported Denver, Tennessee and Pittsburgh have deals in place for Rodgers. Does he want to follow the Peyton Manning route and link up late in his career with John Elway? Does he want to replace Ryan Tannehill and lead a potent Titans offense? Does he want to take over for Ben Roethlisberger for a team ready to win now? Or does he want to return to a team with whom he has won a Super Bowl — but only one — and reportedly has had a hot-and-cold relationship with the front office? Apparently Rodgers doesn’t know yet. Packers GM Brian Gutekunst told reporters this week he hopes for a decision by the beginning of the new league year — March 16.
