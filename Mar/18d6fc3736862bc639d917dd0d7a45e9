Like any parent whose child can do no wrong, Tom Brady Sr. has determined who is to blame for his son’s premature retirement. Tom Brady was forced to make a quicker decision than he wanted on his future because of the media and that’s why he retired and un-retired within a 40-day span, according to his father. ESPN reported Brady’s intent to retire on Jan. 29, Brady denied his mind was made up on Jan. 31 and then ultimately retired on Feb. 1 to prove the anonymous sources used in reporting to be correct. “They were announcing his retirement before he even retired,” Tom Brady Sr. said on the “Greeny” podcast with Mike Greenberg. “You know, the media made the news. He was not ready to make any decision and didn’t make any decision, but [Adam] Schefter and [Jeff] Darlington stated it as fact. You know, he hadn’t made any decision on that.” What changed the G.O.A.T’s mind? Brady announced on the eve of free agency that he was returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ”After [retiring], he had time to reflect with his family: What gives him the greatest joy in his life? And they all agreed that this is the path forward that works best for the Brady family,” Brady Sr. said. The proud father added, “He is happy as can be. … It just took a little bit of time to sort this thing out. I mean, he’s kind of in uncharted territory. So if people might seem to think he took a misstep, hey, welcome to our world. Not very many people get to make this decision at 44 years of age and going on 45.” Brady Sr. told WHDH in Boston earlier this week that, “I think people kind of put him into a corner and all these rumors and things before he was ready to make a decision, and he had to say something just to get the news people off his back.” The 2022 season will be Brady’s 23rd in the NFL, a number matched and exceeded only by kickers. “Nothing replaces the joy that he gets being on the 100-yard football field,” Brady Sr. said. Winning seven Super Bowls can have that effect.
