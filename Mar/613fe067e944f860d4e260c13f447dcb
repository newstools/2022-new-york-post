Vegas Golden Knights forward Brett Howden is in stable condition after he was stretchered off the ice against the Nashville Predators Thursday night. With three minutes left in the first period, Howden was sent headfirst into the boards after a hit from Predators forward Filip Forsberg. Howden lost his footing seconds prior to the terrifying moment, leaving the 23-year-old forward in a vulnerable position. Forsberg landed on Howden and was immediately concerned, skating back to check on the former New York Ranger. Officials did not penalize Forsberg on the play. Emergency officials rushed the ice amid the crowd’s silence and tended to Howden. Howden appeared conscious as he was helped off the ice on a stretcher and transported to a local hospital. The Golden Knights said Howden would undergo further diagnostics and examinations. “We just hope he’s ok,” Predators captain Roman Josi told Bally Sports during the first intermission. “It’s a player’s health. That’s the most important thing. It was definitely shocking. We just hope he’s going to be ok and can recover quickly. Golden Knight head coach Pete DeBoer revealed after the game Howden had full movement. Howden avoided injuries to his neck and spine, according to the Golden Knights. Howden is in his first season with the Golden Knights, where he tallied 20 points through 46 games. He spent the first three years of his NHL career with the Rangers until he was traded last July.
