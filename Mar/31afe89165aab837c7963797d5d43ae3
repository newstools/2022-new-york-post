Unlike her missing husband, Carole Baskin refuses to disappear. The “Tiger King” star, 60, was back in the spotlight Wednesday, starring in a pair of viral TikTok videos that have racked up more than 3 million views. The Big Cat Rescue CEO appeared alongside two young ladies in the clips as they performed a dance routine to the Brooklyn Charles track “Savage: Tiger King Edition.” The lyrics to the song claim that Baskin murdered her missing husband, Don Lewis — who has not been seen since 1997. In the TikTok videos, Baskin is seen laughing and jokingly trying to cut the music as Charles raps the lyrics: “Carole Baskin/ killed her husband/ whacked him.” “No, I didn’t!” Baskin mouths, as the song continues to play. Baskin has vehemently denied she was involved in Lewis’ mysterious disappearance. Thousands of people left comments under the clips, with one writing: “How did you get her to agree to this?!” “You can say a lot of things about Carol, but you can’t say she’s not an icon!” another fan chimed in. Baskin has been basking in the spotlight since she appeared in the “Tiger King” docuseries in 2020. The Netflix doc — which revolved around Baskin’s feud with zookeeper Joe Exotic — became a mega-hit during the early days of the pandemic. In the show, Exotic accused Baskin of having killed her husband before feeding them to tigers at her Big Cat Rescue sanctuary. In 2020, Baskin slammed her portrayal in “Tiger King,” calling it “salacious and sensational.” “As part of that, it has a segment devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don in 1997,” she wrote. But Baskin has been basking in the limelight since she starred on the show. In September 2020, she appeared as a contestant on “Dancing With the Stars,” where she performed a dance routine to the track “Eye of the Tiger.”
