Sure, we adore our office-ready work pants and, undeniably, the comfy pajama sets we want to live in. But, with a solid pair of leggings, you can conquer it all. Aside from the best dresses under $50 (not to mention T-shirt dresses, cocktail dresses and Easter dresses), Amazon is a one-stop-shop for all things leggings. With a slew of options, we’re here to put one of the buzziest, most affordable brands on your radar for those buttery-soft leggings you crave. Satina’s High-Waisted Leggings are now on sale for just $15, slashed down from their original price of $22. Not only were they pretty budget-friendly before this limited-time deal, but now, they’re definitely worth the grab. What we love about the pair is its neutral, taupe-toned hue, the fact that they have pockets (a huge deal) and how it’s flattering on all body types — not to mention how they’re available in regular and plus sizes. Great for working out in (perhaps on your at-home rowing machine, treadmill, elliptical or exercise bike), the breathable “peach skin” fabric is like wearing your favorite throw blanket all day long. What’s more, the pair is made with 8% spandex to help you feel your best, tuck you in and style in many ways. For more styles, Satina also offers the most incredible flare pants ($19) that are reminiscent of Aerie’s much-popular Crossover Flare Leggings, along with Capri-Length Leggings ($15) should you want a pair almost near biker-shorts length.
