Chris Godwin got a huge new contract from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and his wife Mariah posted an inspirational testament to his hard work on Instagram. Godwin, coming off a season-ending ACL injury in December, signed a three-year deal worth $60 million. NFL contracts can be reported with funny money, but the key for Godwin was that he received $40 million fully guaranteed at signing. “You did it,” Mariah wrote in her Instagram Story. “You told me you would since I met you at 13. on draft day you told me, ‘It doesn’t matter where I get picked. I only need a chance. I’m gonna take full advantage of the opportunity I get & I only need a chance. I’m gonna win a Super Bowl & I’m gonna make it to a second contract in this league. I only need a chance.’ & you did exactly what you said you’d do.” Godwin was selected in the third round, 84th overall, by Tampa in the 2017 NFL Draft. He has indeed fulfilled his promise of winning a Super Bowl and earning a second NFL contract. He will have at least one more season catching passes from Tom Brady, who recently ended his brief retirement to rejoin the Buccaneers. “What a ridiculous privilege it is to watch every minute of this story & to take part in it with you. & to see you remain the same kind hearted, humble & ruthlessly dedicated person that you’ve always been,” Mariah continued. “You really did it. & it’s a lot more to do, & I can’t wait to watch you do it all. if your younger self could see you, he would be in awe. you did it.”
