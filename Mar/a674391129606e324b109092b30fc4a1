His crappy day just got worse. A Florida man was left screaming after getting trapped in a porta-potty — then was promptly busted for drug possession by the cops who bailed him out. Bystanders called Naples police after hearing James Gousse, 34, shouting for help after getting stuck in the mobile latrine. An arriving deputy heard Gousse’s yells and spotted his foot protruding from the porta potty’s door. The officer successfully dislodged Gousse and told him to sit down nearby. He told cops that he had somehow gotten his foot jammed and couldn’t get out. Cops searched the john and found a powdery substance that later tested positive for fentanyl. Gousse was placed under arrest and now faces several drug-related charges.
