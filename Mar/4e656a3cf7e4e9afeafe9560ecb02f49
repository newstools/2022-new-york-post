A Nevada woman who went missing on Valentine’s Day before being found clinging to a tree on a cliff has vanished while taking photographs near Hoover Dam, authorities said. Gayle Stewart, 64, who made headlines when she was found dangling from a tree on Feb. 14, has gone missing in the Bypass Bridge parking area near Hoover Dam, the US Park Rangers and the National Park Service said. Stewart had “traveled to the area to take photographs and did not return to her vehicle,” officials said. She was last seen March 14. The blond, blue-eyed woman is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs about 125 pounds. She was last seen wearing a black, long-sleeve shirt, black leggings and black shoes, the statement said. “Though no further details for this ongoing missing person investigation are available at this time, information from other visitors is often very helpful to investigators,” officials added. A spokesperson for Lake Mead National Recreation Area confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that Stewart is the same woman who went missing in northern Nevada last month. In that incident, she was found in a hiking area of the Caughlin Ranch neighborhood, NBC affiliate KRNV reported.  It was unclear how she ended up clinging onto the tree. Stewart was missing a shoe and both her legs had “quite a bit of trauma,” meaning she could have fallen down the steep terrain, fire officials said.
