The death of an 8-year-old autistic boy rushed to a Bronx hospital last year has been ruled a homicide, cops said Tuesday. Joseph Barney’s mother brought him from their Williamsbridge home to Montefiore Medical Center June 1 in an Uber, cops and sources said. Cops responded to a call from the hospital’s emergency room around 2:10 p.m. and found the boy unconscious and unresponsive. The boy, who had no obvious signs of trauma, was pronounced dead at the hospital. Police said Tuesday that Joseph’s death had been ruled a homicide, as a result of battered child syndrome. The boy had been taken to Montefiore numerous times with indications of child abuse, police sources said. Investigators are looking to speak to the child’s parents, particularly his father, the sources said. No arrests were immediately made. Investigators were initially probing whether malnutrition was a factor in Joseph’s death. Joseph was only 30 pounds when he died, police sources said at the time. According to CDC figures, the average 8-year-old should weigh around 50 pounds.
