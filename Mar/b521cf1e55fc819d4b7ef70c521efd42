A Pennsylvania man fatally shot a father of four as he tried to unload his gun while stopped at a red light, police said. Lloyd Amarsingh, 28, has been charged with third-degree murder in the Friday morning shooting that he claims was accidental, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Amarsingh, of Darby, told detectives he pulled out his gun and tried to unload it while stopped at an intersection in Upper Darby, but the weapon went off accidentally as he tried to remove a live round from the chamber, according to an affidavit of probable cause for his arrest. The weapon fired from Amarsingh’s white Audi A4 and struck Jim Hunt, 56, of Havertown, who was also at the intersection in a white Mercedes Sprinter, WPVI reported. Amarsingh then sped through the red light, according to the affidavit, and responding cops later found Hunt slumped behind the wheel of his van while the vehicle was still running. Hunt, who was shot once in the head, was later pronounced dead at a hospital, WPVI reported. Amarsingh surrendered to cops hours after the shooting. In addition to third-degree murder, he was charged with involuntary manslaughter and possessing an instrument of crime. Investigators initially considered the shooting an apparent road-rage incident, the Inquirer reported Friday. Amarsingh turned himself in to cops after contacting an attorney, Upper Darby Police Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt said, adding that Hunt was on his way to work at the time of the deadly shooting. Amarsingh’s relatives declined to speak with reporters, according to CBS Philadelphia. A friend of Hunt, meanwhile, told the station he was struggling to process his death. “It’s mind-boggling because he’s not confrontational,” friend Joe Rufo said. “He really is not a confrontational guy, so for something like this to happen, it really blows me away.” Amarsingh is being held without bail at a jail in Delaware Cunty and has a preliminary hearing April 6, WPVI reported.
