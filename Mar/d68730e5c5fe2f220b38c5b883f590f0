Mr. College Football will now also be a part of the NFL. Kirk Herbstreit has officially agreed to a deal with Amazon to be its game analyst when it begins its exclusive coverage of “Thursday Night Football,” according to sources. Herbstreit will continue with ESPN, where he will be on College GameDay and be the network’s No. 1 game analyst for college football. Amazon is still waiting for Al Michaels to sign his three-year, $33 million deal to join “Thursday Night Football.” Michaels and Amazon have been deep into talks, but Michaels was waiting to see what would happen with Joe Buck and “Monday Night Football.” Sources said with the Buck news, Michaels is now at the “half-yard line” on going to Amazon. On Friday, Fox Sports granted Buck permission to speak to ESPN, The Post reported. A deal between Buck and ESPN is expected to reunite him with Troy Aikman on “Monday Night Football.” Kevin Burkhardt is the favorite to replace Buck on Fox’s lead NFL broadcast, though, Michaels can’t be 100 percent counted out. The Post first connected Herbstreit to Amazon at the end of February. On Monday, NBC’s Peter King said Amazon had settled on him. It is now a done deal. Herbstreit is headed to Amazon for the NFL, while remaining at ESPN for college. Amazon also will have alternative feeds for its NFL games that are still to be determined.
