Prom season is here, which means we’re all about the elegant gowns, fresh-bloomed flowers and memories that’ll adorn your photo frames and Instagram accounts for years. Whether you’re off to a night you’ll always remember with a partner or a best friend (or even solo, #hereforit), your dream dress is right around the corner. But, those skyrocketing prices may lead you to another more-affordable route — and, rightfully so. We pulled together this year’s edit of the 25 best prom dresses under $200. We’ve heard it all, too — you’ll only wear it once; it’s only one night — but we’re not about compromising style in the process. Not to mention, these coveted styles can be reworn to future weddings, galas and other formal events if you want something a bit dressier than the best cocktail dresses out there. Plus, with prom dresses from Windsor, Lulus, Amazon and more, you’ll be dressed to the nines, your most comfortable heels for dancing and clear lip gloss for reapplying in tow (not to mention, a grandeur designer clutch). Click to jump to a specific prom dress shop: We’re virtually obsessed with Woosea’s V-Neck Split Evening Dress, a flattering, simplistic option that’ll make you pop at prom.
