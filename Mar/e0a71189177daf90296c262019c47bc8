Cue up the “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” parrot clip. Princeton resident Tim Lynch spotted what he thought was a parrot that had flown the coop and landed in some woods on Wednesday, WPVI-TV reported. He snapped a photo of the colorful bird and sent it to his nephew, a sergeant in the town’s police department, who promptly sent Animal Control Officer Jim Ferry to the scene. “The two of us were walking back there not wanting to scare it so it flies away, and as we get closer I’m thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, this poor thing is dead,'” Lynch told WPVI. “We’re about two feet away, he’s about to throw the net over it, and he goes, ‘It’s fake!'” he added. Ferry said animal control officers have a saying “that a sick or injured animal is very easy to catch — and this was probably the easiest catch I’ve ever had.” After the cuckoo rescue, the ceramic parrot was taken to the police station until its owner can be tracked down.
