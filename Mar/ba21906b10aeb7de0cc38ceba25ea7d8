A Washington state sheriff’s deputy died Wednesday after he was wounded during a shootout with a man wanted for a past assault, authorities and a report said. Dominique “Dom” Calata, 35, was one of two deputies with the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department shot during the mayhem at a mobile-home park near Spanaway on Tuesday afternoon, the Seattle Times reported. The deputies had joined local authorities with the South Sound Gang Task Force to arrest the suspect, Jeremy Dayton, who was being sought on a warrant for second-degree assault, the report said. Gunfire erupted and Calata and Sgt. Rich Scaniffe, 45, were wounded in the shooting. Calata, an Army veteran who had been with the sheriff’s department for over six years, died from his injuries Wednesday, authorities said. He was married and leaves behind a young son. Dayton was also killed during the shootout. Scaniffe, a 21-year veteran of the department, underwent surgery and was listed in stable condition.
