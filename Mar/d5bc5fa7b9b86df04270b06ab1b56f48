President Joe Biden has added a stop to Poland during his European trip this week to discuss the dire situation in Ukraine with NATO and European allies, as Russia continues to bombard Ukrainian cities while millions of civilians attempt to flee nearly a month into its invasion. Biden will fly to Warsaw on Friday following his trip to Brussels where he is scheduled to meet with NATO allies, G7 leaders, and European Union leaders to discuss humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Sunday night. He will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Saturday to discuss how the US and its allies are “responding to the humanitarian and human rights crisis that Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine has created,” Psaki said. Poland – a NATO member state that shares a border with Ukraine – has been hosting thousands of American troops and has taken in more than 2 million refugees who have crossed into the country from Ukraine. Poland has been asking NATO allies to consider getting more involved in their neighboring country’s conflict to help stop the bloodshed. Biden has no plans to travel to Ukraine, White House officials said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken briefly crossed into neighboring Ukraine during his visit to Poland earlier this month in a show of solidarity alongside Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. On Monday ahead of his trip, Biden will discuss the war with European leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdomthe White House said Sunday.
