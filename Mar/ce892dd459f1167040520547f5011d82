Stephen A. Smith and Chris Russo can’t stop screaming at each other. It’s safe to say they’re enjoying it. The two put on another boisterous display Wednesday on ESPN’s “First Take.” Russo was incredulous at Smith’s belief that Steph Curry is among the top 10 NBA players of all time. “No he’s not! Are you kidding me?!?” Russo yelled, sparking a challenge to name players Curry is better than. Russo, who believes Kevin Durant deserves most of the credit for two of Curry’s three rings, asked Smith to pick between Curry and Larry Bird if he had a series to win for his life. Smith paused, prompting Russo to scream, “Don’t even go there!” Smith conceded he couldn’t pick against a healthy Bird. Asked to pick between Curry and Magic Johnson with a series on the line, Smith said it depends on what he needs. More yelling ensued. Again, Smith conceded he’d pick Johnson. Smith also chose Kareem Abdul-Jabbar over Curry, but Russo was as animated as could be when Smith made a case for Curry over Bill Russell, even fumbling his earpiece as he argued. Last month, Russo, the longtime WFAN and SiriusXM radio host, began joining Smith on “First Take” every Wednesday.
