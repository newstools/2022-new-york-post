Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was in such bad shape that he feared that he would die after an alleged poisoning earlier this month during peace negotiations to end the invasion of Ukraine, a report said Wednesday. “Are we dying?” Abramovich asked a scientist brought in to evaluate him, the New York Times reported. The billionaire and Kremlin confidant was one of three men who suffered from peeling skin on their faces and hands, constant and painful tearing, red eyes and temporary blindness following a meeting in Kyiv. The trio — which included Ukrainian member of parliament Rustem Umerov and another, unidentified Russian businessman — recovered over the weeks that followed. Amid speculation that the apparent poisoning was the work of Kremlin hardliners bent on derailing the peace process, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed the whole affair as part of an “information war.” An unnamed Western official cautioned against ruling out “environmental factors” as the cause of the men’s symptoms. “The evidence is rather sketchy and in a difficult place,” the official told the New York Times on Wednesday. Peskov confirmed that Abramovich has been serving as a diplomatic go-between in an unofficial capacity. It is widely believed the oligarch has been relaying messages between Moscow and Kyiv. Abramovich was spotted Tuesday among the delegations in Istanbul, where another round of peace talks between the two nations has begun.
