American basketball star Brittney Griner’s weeks-long detainment in Moscow has been extended for another two months, Russian state media said Thursday. The 31-year-old WNBA all-star has been in custody since she was arrested at a Moscow airport last month for having vape cartridges in her luggage. Citing a Moscow court decision, state news agency TASS reported that Griner’s “period of detention” was being drawn out until at least May 19. “The court granted the petition of the investigation and extended the term of detention of U.S. citizen Griner,” the court said. Ekaterina Kalugina, a member of the Moscow-based Public Monitoring Commission group that observes the treatment of prisoners, told TASS that Griner was sharing a cell with two other women with no previous convictions. She added that Griner’s only issue was the prison beds were too short for her 6-foot-7-inch frame. Kalugina also claimed that US Consulate officials had not visited Griner in the pre-trial detention center. Without identifying Griner by name, the Russian Customs Service revealed earlier this month that the basketball star was detained in February after arriving at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport from New York. The exact date of her arrest and the full circumstances surrounding it haven’t been made clear. Russian authorities have accused Griner of drug smuggling after claiming she was carrying cannabis oil. Griner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, has played during the WNBA offseason for the Russian team Ekaterinburg in the Euroleague since 2015. Former first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday became the latest high-profile American to call for Griner’s release, tweeting: “Free Brittany.” Griner could face between five and 10 years in a Russian prison if convicted.
