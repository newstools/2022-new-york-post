Ukraine’s armed forces warned Russia Friday that the possibly mythical fighter pilot dubbed the Ghost of Kyiv is “coming for your soul.” The country’s general staff posted a photo on its Facebook page showing the purported pilot wearing a black visor and oxygen mask in the cockpit of his MiG-29 fighter jet. “‘Hello, Russian villain, I’m coming for your soul!’ – the Ghost of Kyiv,” the threatening post said. The pilot in the photo can be seen pointing out the missiles on his Soviet-designed jet. Rumors about the Ghost of Kyiv have gone viral on social media almost from the moment the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. One story claimed the Ghost had supposedly downed as many as six Russian planes on the first day of combat. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed whether the Ghost is real — or just an urban legend. Regardless, the pilot has become a folk hero amid the bloodshed and the term has been adopted to refer to the entire Ukrainian air force. Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage. The Ghost threat from the armed forces came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky begged NATO and its allies once again to enforce a no-fly zone amid the constant Russian bombing attacks. Those calls have so far been rejected by the US and NATO. US lawmakers warned earlier this week that any such move would put American forces in direct contact with Russian troops and potentially instigate World War III.
