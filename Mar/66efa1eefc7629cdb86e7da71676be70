Tom Brady is hoping to ease the pain of a deflated fan. The briefly-retired GOAT urged digital trader FTX to donate a Bitcoin to the charity of choice of a fan who dropped $518,000 March 12 on a prized football thrown by the NFL legend in a January playoff game. It was thought to be the last touchdown pass of Brady’s storied career. The value of the ball collapsed the day after the record pigskin purchase, when Brady announced he was returning to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers again in the 2022 season. “Hey @ftx_official … could we donate a Bitcoin to the charity of this person’s choice?!” the quarterback posted to his 11.7 million Instagram followers on Friday. Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen are equity partners in FTX. The caption ran beneath a video of the gorgeous arching touchdown pass he threw to Mike Evans in Tampa Bay’s Jan. 23 playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams. The future Hall of Famer then announced his retirement on Feb. 1. The video of the touchdown toss was edited in the Instagram post to make the football look like a Bitcoin. One appraiser put the new value of the football at $20,000, according to the Daily Mail. A Bitcoin is currently worth about $42,000. The unnamed football buyer will still suffer a nearly $500,000 hit even if FTX comes through with the goodwill gesture made to charity. Leland Auctions expected the prized parabola to net as much as $1 million, shattering the previous record of $428,000 it scored last year for the football thrown by Brady for his first career touchdown pass in 2001.
