Ladies and gentlemen, start your signings: NFL free agency is here. With the league’s calendar officially flipping to 2022 beginning on Wednesday, Mar. 16, and there will be a bevy of big-name players on the move. Not that the action will wait: starting Monday at noon, the NFL’s legal tampering period allows teams to begin discussing contracts with free agents. Deals can be hashed out fully — but not made official until Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET. Last year, the New England Patriots went on a $159 million spending spree; this year, the Indianapolis Colts arrive to free agency with almost $70 millon in cap space and plenty of positions to fill. The players likely to command big figure deals? It’s a defense-heavy class with edge rushers Von Miller and Chandler Jones and cornerback J.C. Jackson primed to cash in. Offensively, receivers Allen Robinson and Odell Beckham Jr. are top available options, with QB Mitch Trubisky expected to find himself in a starter’s role, with a contract to match it.
