Barbara Maier Gustern, the 87-year-old former voice coach critically hurt in a random shove attack in Chelsea last week, has died from her injuries, her family said Tuesday. “Today, at 11:15AM, we have lost one of the brightest little flames to ever grace this world,” the family wrote on Gustern’s Facebook page. “I ask that you all give me a little time and space, but I want to make time for anyone and everyone who wants to know more about her final moments,” the post said. “Bobbob, I love you, you are and always will be my heart,” it said. “I love you all so much, I could not have made it through these past 5 days without all of your support.” A high-ranking police official confirmed to The Post that Gustern died from her injuries on Monday night. It was unclear who wrote the Facebook post but Gursten’s grandson, AJ, posted an update on her condition on the page last week. Gustern, a onetime famed voice coach whose students included Blondie singer Debbie Harry, was walking along West 28th Street around 8 p.m. Thursday when an unidentified woman came up behind her and shoved her to the ground. Her redheaded attacker, who has not been apprehended, then ran off. Police said the attacker crossed the street before pushing Gursten, who suffered a serious — and now fatal — head injury. “We’re asking the public’s help in solving this disgusting, disgraceful law offense committed against the vulnerable elderly female who is doing nothing but walking down the streets of New York City,” NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said at a press conference Tuesday. “So please, any, any information on this person’s whereabouts or whereabouts for 1-800-577-TIPS,” he added.
