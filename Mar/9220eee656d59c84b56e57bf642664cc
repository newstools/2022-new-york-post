A dog has given birth to a rare puppy with green fur after its owners feared the pet was stillborn. Bulldog Freya had a litter of eight with one of the newborn pups coming out the unusual color. Owners Trevor and Audra Mosher said names being considered for the pup include Fiona after Shrek’s princess, Hulkette and Pistachio. Posting to Facebook Audra wrote: “Our lil green puppy apparently is a rare thing to see. “I wish the color would stay it would be really cool!” Fiona had been born with a black sac; her siblings were in translucent ones. It is thought that the hue is a result of contact with green bile biliverdin in the womb. The couple, who live in Canada, had thought she was stillborn until they spotted her moving. Trevor told Global News: “We started to dry her off and noticed she was green and immediately again thought there was something wrong. “So we googled it, ‘my puppy is green, what’s wrong,’ and apparently it is very rare and it has happened a few times all over the world. “I’m kind of amazed, really. As rare as it seems to be, I feel very lucky to have witnessed it and be a part of it.” Dr. Bronwyn Crane said she suspects the odds of it happening are less than one in 10,000. She said: “I have not come across a green puppy before.” The color will eventually fade until it is gone completely. In 2020 The Sun reported how a white German Shepherd named Gypsy gave birth to a green dog. The puppy’s strange hue may have been caused by “meconium”, the earliest stool produced by an infant dog in the mother’s womb, experts said at the time.
