Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training action on Wednesday: Gleyber Torres and Giancarlo Stanton both homered to right field in the Yankees’ 7-1 win over Baltimore at Steinbrenner Field, with Torres going deep in the fourth and Stanton hitting a laser out in the fifth. Torres, Stanton and DJ LeMahieu all hit their first Grapefruit League homers of the season. Wandy Peralta drilled Baltimore left-fielder DJ Stewart on the left hand, forcing Stewart from the game. To add insult to injury, Stewart was ruled to have swung at the pitch for a third strike and the final out of the inning. Joey Gallo had issues both at the plate and in left field last year with the Yankees, but he made a nice diving catch in left to end the top of the fourth. He also added a pair of hits, including a double. The Yankees are scheduled to visit the Tigers at Joker Marchant Stadium in Lakeland, Fla., at 1:05 p.m., with Clarke Schmidt on the mound, but the game is in danger of being washed out with a wet forecast predicted for the area throughout the day.
