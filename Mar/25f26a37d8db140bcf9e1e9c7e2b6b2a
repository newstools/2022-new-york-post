A human leg was discovered on a Brooklyn street Monday – just days after a human torso was found blocks away, cops said. A male passerby spotted the severed limb inside a discarded tire on Jamaica Avenue near Vermont Street in Cypress Hills just before 3:30 p.m., authorities said. It was not immediately clear whether the discovery was related to another gruesome find about three-and-a-half blocks away last week, cops said. In that case, a male passerby found a woman’s dismembered torso dumped in a shopping cart on Pennsylvania and Atlantic avenues in Cypress Hills around 1:45 a.m. Thursday, authorities said. The man went to push the cart when he spotted a bag inside, looked inside and saw the torso — which was missing a head, arms and legs, according to police. He then called 911, cops said. The woman’s identity remains under investigation.
