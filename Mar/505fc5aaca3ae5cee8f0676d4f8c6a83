Chris Rock got the bejesus slapped out of him by none other than Will Smith at the 2022 Oscars. After Rock joked that he couldn’t wait to see Smith’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith in “GI Jane 2,” Smith ran up on stage at Dolby Theater and hit Rock in the face. The audio was cut and censored for several seconds but captions indicated that the “King Richard” star said “keep my wife’s name out of your f–king mouth.” Before Smith whopped the comedian’s behind, Rock had made a joke about Pinkett being in the fake-action film because of her bald head. She had previously spoken about having a hair loss condition, alopecia. “I did not know that this year would be the most exciting Oscar ever,” Sean “Diddy” Combs said after. “Will and Chris we’re gonna solve that like family at the goal party right now we’re moving on with love.” Twitter was shocked with the viral moment with many fans immediately expressing their thoughts after the segment. “Okay….WHAT JUST HAPPENED with that will and Chris thing  #Oscars,” one wrote. Another added, “We wont talk about Bruno, but we need to talk about Will and Chris? Wtf just happen?  #Oscars#Oscars2022.” One fan chimed in, “i’m sitting right here and i thought that was scripted. that was not scripted oh my god what’s the story will and chris?!!!  #Oscars.” Someone wrote, “Jaws are on the floor here at Neons #Oscars party after what just happened between Will and Chris Rock.” Another joked, “how are they gonna have a gospel segment after what just happened with will and chris.” The In Memoriam portion of the telecast was presented right after the wild moment. “the oscars had to bring the gospel singers out after will and chris mess #oscars,” said one user.
