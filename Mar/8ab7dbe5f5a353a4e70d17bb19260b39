Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp sat courtside with wife Anna Wednesday night, as the Sixers topped the struggling Lakers 126-121 at Crypto.com Arena. The couple’s date night included posing for a photo with the NBA’s 75th anniversary diamond basketball during the game. Kupp shared the photo on his Instagram Story writing, “Date night!” Anna also shared a selfie with Kupp to her Instagram Story while on their way to the arena. The hoops game appears to be part of a birthday celebration for Anna. Kupp shared a sweet tribute to his wife Tuesday in an Instagram post, calling Anna “my stone cold fox.” “So thankful for you and the love you have for your family. No other person on this earth I would rather do life with!” the receiver wrote. That same day, Kupp and his wife were pictured at Fia Restaurant in Santa Monica with the receiver’s Rams teammates — quarterback Matthew Stafford and wife Kelly, and Andrew Whitworth and his wife Melissa. Whitworth announced his retirement earlier this month after 16 NFL seasons. Anna shared the group photo with the Staffords and Whitworths to her Instagram Story, writing, “Love this squad.” Kelly posted the photo to the Instagram account of her podcast, “The Morning After with Kelly Stafford.” In her caption, she shared that the group was “celebrating our girl @annamariekupp.”
