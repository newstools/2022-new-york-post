Cole Tucker may not have been at the Oscars with girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens, but he certainly had himself a day miles away. The Pirates shortstop, 25, hit a home run off Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole on Sunday afternoon in Tampa, – which Hudgens caught wind of out west in Los Angeles, where she co-hosted an Oscars pre-show. “What a way to start Oscars Sunday,” the “Tick, Tick… Boom!” actress, 33, exclaimed on social media. “Couldn’t be happier!!!!!” Despite Tucker’s massive shot, the Pirates came up short against the Yanks, 7-4. Later in the day Sunday, Tucker turned his attention to Hudgens as she readied for Hollywood’s biggest night. “Big oscars girl,” he gushed on his Instagram Story. Hudgens first dazzled on the Oscars red carpet in a cutout black dress from the Michael Kors Collection, which she accessorized with a striking emerald and diamond necklace. She switched up her look later in the night, wearing a strapless Valentino gown to the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscar Party. Hudgens and Tucker have been dating for more than a year, and celebrated their milestone anniversary in December. “1 year down @coltuck love you,” she posted on Instagram at the time. Prior to her relationship with Tucker, Hudgens dated actor Austin Butler, with the pair ending their nearly nine-year romance in January 2020. Tucker, meanwhile, is getting ready for Pittsburgh’s season opener on April 7, when the Pirates face the Cardinals.
