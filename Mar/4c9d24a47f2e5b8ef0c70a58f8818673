Providence and Kansas will clash in the Sweet Sixteen in what looks to be a solid matchup between two tough programs. The Jayhawks average the 13th-most points per game in the country this year, while Providence is strong on the glass and thrives on defending the perimeter. Don’t default to the name recognition of Kansas in this matchup. Gametime: 7:29pm EST TV: TBS Live Stream: CBS Sports App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The Friars have exceeded expectations all season. Why should the Sweet 16 be any different? The so-called “luckiest” team in the country has beaten 10 teams that reached the NCAA Tournament. Providence topped Texas Tech and Wisconsin, among others, and suffered a two-point loss at Villanova a few weeks ago. Providence has played well against some of the country’s top teams and matches up well with the Jayhawks, whose offense has sagged in recent weeks (including shooting struggles by leading-scorer Ochai Agbaji) and will be facing a tough, experienced and versatile defense. The Friars may lose to the more talented team, but their strength on the glass, lack of turnovers and ability to get to the free-throw line gives Ed Cooley’s team a strong chance to play their latest close game. After reaching the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1997, Providence is no longer playing with the kind of pressure that has strangled teams coached by Kansas’ Bill Self on several occasions.
