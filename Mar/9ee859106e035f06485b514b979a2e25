NASA will let you send your name on a flight around the Moon – for FREE. It’s the perfect treat for space fans who long to go to space…even if only in name. The offer is to have your name saved on a flash drive as part of the upcoming Artemis I mission. The launch is expected to take place in the next few months, though an exact date hasn’t been confirmed. “Artemis I will be the first unscrewed flight test of the Space Launch System rocketed the Orion spacecraft,” NASA said. “The flight paves the way toward landing the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon!” If you sign up, you’ll get access to a virtual boarding pass. It will feature your name and the details of the flight. And you’ll get a QR code that lets you join NASA launches as a virtual guest. Of course, you’re not actually going to space. But a representation of you will be soaring around the Moon, which is quite fun – and totally free. “All eyes will be on the historic Launch Complex 39B when Orion and the Space Launch System (SLS) lift off for the first time from NASA’s modernized Kennedy Space Center in Florida,” said NASA. “The mission will demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond.” “Artemis I will be the first in a series of increasingly complex missions to build a long-term human presence at the Moon for decades to come.” You need to go to NASA’s official website for the Artemis mission. That’s available here. You need to enter your name and a custom PIN, which will generate your boarding pass. The PIN needs to be 4 to 7 digits. Remember the PIN, as this will allow you access your boarding pass in the future. This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
