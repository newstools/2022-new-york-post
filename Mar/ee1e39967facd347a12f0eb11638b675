A teenage student allegedly killed two teachers at a high school in southern Sweden on Monday – then reportedly called police and confessed to the grisly attack. The 18-year-old suspect allegedly carried out the killings on the third floor of Malmo Latin School, located in the city of Malmo, at about 5 p.m. as students were gathered in the building to work on a musical, according to police. The male student was arrested after police found him near the two victims, who were women in their 50s, police said. According to a report by the Aftonbladet newspaper, the student was the one who called authorities and allegedly admitted he had killed two people. He was armed with a knife and ax when he was found, the report said. Local police could not immediately confirm the newspaper’s account. The student had no criminal record and it was unclear what led to the bloodshed. “For now it is far too early to comment on that,” Malmö Police Chief Petra Stenkula said. With AP wires
