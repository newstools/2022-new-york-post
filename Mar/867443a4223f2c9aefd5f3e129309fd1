A man was slashed on the wrist when he tried to stop a pair of teens from robbing a woman inside a Queens subway station Thursday morning, cops said. The 40-year-old victim was on the Court Square G train platform around 7:20 a.m. when he spotted a teen boy and girl attempting to snatch a woman’s phone, police said. When he tried to intervene, one of the teens slashed him on the wrist before the duo took off, cops said. The victim was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in stable condition, police said. Cops say the male suspect appeared to be around 14 or 15, wearing a black shiny jacket and a black mask. The female suspect was about 16, and she also wore a black mask, police said. The incident is just the latest in a spate of crime underground.
