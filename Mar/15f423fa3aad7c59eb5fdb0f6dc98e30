Holy cancellation, Batman! Warner Bros. announced Monday that it would be halting all its theatrical releases in Russia, including “The Batman,” amid Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The move comes as Russia escalated its offensive Tuesday by bombing Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and dispatching a 40-mile-long convoy of tanks and other equipment to Kyiv. “In light of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, WarnerMedia is pausing the release of its feature film ‘The Batman’ in Russia,” the studio said in a statement, per the Hollywood Reporter. “We will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves. “We hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to this tragedy.” The Matt Reeves superhero flick, which stars Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz, was slated to premiere in Russia on Tuesday. Other scheduled Warner Bros. releases in the country included “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” (April 14) and the comic book cartoon “DC League of Super-Pets” (May 19). The decision comes as other Hollywood studios nix their projects from Russia amid the ongoing conflict. Disney started the trend last month after delaying its major releases in the country, most notably the latest Pixar film “Turning Red.” “We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis,” the House of Mouse said in a statement. “We are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.” Sony Pictures followed suit on Feb. 28, announcing it would also pause theatrical releases of its productions in Russia, including its upcoming vampire thriller “Morbius.” Russia is one of the top box office markets in the world with Sony’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” raking in more than $44.5 million to date since airing in the country in December, per THR.
