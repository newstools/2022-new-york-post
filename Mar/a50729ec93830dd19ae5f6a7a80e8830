It’s the return of the Mack to the AFC West. According to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport, the Los Angeles Chargers are “closing in” on acquiring star pass rusher Khalil Mack from the Chicago Bears. Rapoport added that the trade should happen, pending some “contract tinkering” and a physical. The Chargers would be trading a 2022 second round pick and a 2023 sixth round pick to land him. Right before the 2018 NFL season, the Bears acquired Mack from the Raiders for a package that included two first round picks. This past season, Mack played just seven games for the Bears, undergoing season-ending foot surgery in November. In four seasons with the Bears, Mack accumulated 36 sacks. If Mack, 31, can recover for next season, the Chargers will have acquired a formidable pass rusher.
