Brittney Griner’s wife, Cherelle, continues to express the hurt she feels while the basketball star is detained in Russia. Griner, the seven-time WNBA All-Star, has been detained in Russia for more than three weeks after cannabis vapes were allegedly found in her luggage at the airport. Cherelle wrote on Instagram on Monday that advice to “stay busy” has been insufficient. “We love you babe!” Cherelle Griner wrote. “People say ‘stay busy.’ Yet, there’s not a task in this world that could keep any of us from wondering if you are safe.” She continued to describe the magnitude of her emotions. “My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by without hearing from you. I miss your voice. I miss your presence. You’re our person! There are no words to express this pain. I’m hurting, we’re hurting. We await the day to love on you as a family.” Griner has played in Russia since 2014-15. According to the AP, she earns more than $1 million per season there – more than quadruple her WNBA base salary. If she were to play stateside only, Griner would stand to make up to $500,000 with bonuses and marketing deals. The circumstances around her arrest are made more complex by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has elicited international sanctions against Russia. This complicates any negotiations for her safe return. Earlier this week, Cherelle Griner called for her wife to come home. “Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me regarding my wife’s safe return from Russia,” Cherelle Griner wrote on Instagram on Saturday. “Your prayers and support are greatly appreciated. “I love my wife wholeheartedly, so this message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life. I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details. Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely,” she continued. The couple has been married since 2019.
