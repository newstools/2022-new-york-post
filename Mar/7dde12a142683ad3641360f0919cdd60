He snuck into the world’s most erotic museum — and made out with two T-shirts. The NYPD on Wednesday released surveillance footage of a fresh-faced suspect they say strolled into the gift shop of Manhattan’s Museum of Sex last Thursday and allegedly snatched the clothing valued at $60. The suspect, wearing a maroon sweatshirt and black-rimmed glasses, had entered through the museum’s partially secured 5th Avenue front door at about 11:30 a.m. — an hour and a half before the attraction opens, police said. He was caught on camera putting down his iced coffee to sift through the store’s merchandise — eventually choosing the T-shirts, worth $30 each,  according to the police and the footage. Before claiming his haul, the suspect moseyed around the gift shop, looking befuddled and at one point making eye contact the surveillance camera. He fled on foot and was still in the wind as of early Thursday. The Museum of Sex bills itself as “the world’s foremost museum of the cultural significance of human sexuality,” according to its website.
