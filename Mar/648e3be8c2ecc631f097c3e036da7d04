About 400 used bulletproof vests that were supposed to be donated to Ukraine were stolen sometime overnight from a nonprofit organization in Manhattan, police said Wednesday. The vests were being stored at 203 Second Ave. near 12th Street in the East Village and were slated to be sent to the country that has been under siege by Russian forces since Feb. 24. Somebody called 911 after discovering the heist at 9:19 a.m., police said. When cops arrived, they found someone had forced their way into the building, police said. The vests were being stored in a hallway and were “visible to the public,” a police source said. The used vests were donated by the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, a police source said. The sheriff’s office said they were looking into the report. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Women’s League of America are both listed at the Manhattan address. A police official said the used vests were donated by the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office. But Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Vicki DiStefano said her agency was unable to confirm whether the vests they donated were the ones that were taken. “While we cannot confirm that the items the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office donated are the items in question, it is despicable that someone would break into a building and steal supplies and materials intended to aid those affected by this humanitarian crisis,” DiStefano said. “We offer the NYPD any assistance it needs in locating these stolen items.”
