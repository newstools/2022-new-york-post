New York City is working with the feds to help Ukrainians reunite with family in the Big Apple, officials said Sunday. “We will work closely with the federal government to expedite refugee status for Ukrainians so that Ukrainian New Yorkers can bring their families and their loved ones here to New York,” the city’s Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs Manny Castro said at a press conference with Mayor Eric Adams in Brooklyn. Castro also announced a new city website with resources for Ukrainian New Yorkers amid the Russian invasion. “We have set up a website so that people can visit and access all the resources provided by city government for Ukrainian New Yorkers, both that want to apply for [Temporary Protection Status] and who want to bring their relatives to the country when that is possible,” said Castro in Brighton Beach. To help with a donation drive for Ukrainians, Adams also vowed to work on securing warehouse space to store food and supplies. “Now I’m going to immediately dispatch my team here. Let’s find a warehouse so we can store these supplies because so many Americans want to help in any way possible,” Adams said when asked by The Post about the effort. “We are going to put our full pressure on finding a warehouse so we can store these supplies.” Adams’ comments came after Assemblyman Steven Cymbrowitz (D-Brighton Beach) said there’s been an outpouring of support in his district but that volunteers need more space for the donated supplies. “The food drive, the medical supplies that they’re gathering is enormous!” he said of the effort led by local churches and synagogues.
