This is the shocking moment a schoolboy shoves a BBC reporter “hard” in the back live on air. Lucinda Adam was presenting from outside Brighton station when the youngster pushed her into the camera – allegedly egged on by his sniggering mom. The jolt was broadcast live on South East Today’s 6 pm news bulletin on March 1, sparking a police investigation. Footage of the incident shows the child, thought to be about eight, smiling and dancing behind Lucinda as she does a piece of camera about the rise in train fares. But moments later the lad shoves a wide-eyed Lucinda from behind then sprints off. She has since said the “assault” has left her “shaken, quite angry and a bit sad” – especially as he was encouraged by his laughing mother. Following the ordeal, Lucinda said: “Reporting live from Brighton tonight when a young boy about eight started mucking about waving his arms behind me. “We’ve all been there, but then he shoved me hard in the back before running off.” “The saddest part is his mom was across the road egging him on and you can hear her howling with laughter.” “It’s not funny, it’s assault while someone is doing their job. Where has kindness gone?” She later thanked friends and viewers who had messaged to ask if she was ok, adding: “I’m fine thanks, just a bit shaken, quite angry and a bit sad.” Sussex Police confirmed officers were looking into the incident and urged anyone with information to come forward. A spokesperson for the force added: “Police received a third-party report of an assault in Queens Road, Brighton on Tuesday evening (March 1).” “Contact has been made with the victim and inquiries are ongoing.” “Anyone with information is asked to contact police online or call 101 quoting serial number 1433 of 01/03.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
