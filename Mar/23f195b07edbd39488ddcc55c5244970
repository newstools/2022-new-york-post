Mayor Eric Adams just took a bad decision and made it worse. It was pure sabotage — not to mention government overreach — when, in his final days in office, Mayor Bill de Blasio imposed a vax mandate for private employers. But rather than reverse the decision on Day 1, Adams dithered, and countless private employees lost their jobs. Then came the realization that who knows how many Yankees or Mets wouldn’t be able to take the field because of the rule. In a baseball-crazy town, this was political suicide. So Thursday, Adams is expected — at Citi Field no less — to carve out an exception for performers and athletes, finally letting Kyrie Irving play home games for the Nets. It’s deeply unfair and ripe for lawsuits. We want Irving and baseball players to compete, but they shouldn’t get a special loophole over, say, the Midtown bookkeeper. Yes, there’s going to be some turmoil from overturning the private mandate, as people who were fired clamor for their jobs back. But it’s the right decision, and these half-measures are an insult to everyone. Let Kyrie play. But let Kyle from accounting work, too.
