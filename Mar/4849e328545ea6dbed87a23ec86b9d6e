It’s the year of the cheerleaders in this year’s March Madness! An Arkansas Razorbacks cheerleader came to the rescue during Arkansas’ Elite Eight matchup against Duke on Saturday night. Television cameras captured the viral moment when the cheerleader was raised by her teammate to push the trapped ball off the backboard with 18:22 in the second half of the game. Fans inside Chase Center erupted, following brief silence, as the ball was freed and the game continued. Indiana University cheerleader Cassidy Cerny went viral for the same in-game heroics, during Indiana’s first-round tournament game between the Saint Mary’s Gaels on March 17. Cerny would go on to recently sign a NIL deal with T-shirt company, BreakingT, following the game. The shirt features Cerny and the caption, “The Cheerleader Saves the Day” across the front.
