In the US, the issues reported were concentrated in New York and Los Angeles. Among the errors encountered by users was a message saying that their username and password were incorrect. Another one, which displayed when Spotify users tried to launch songs on the company’s site, said, “We’re all mixed up. Refresh this page or try again later. It may take some time to get things up again.” On Spotify’s mobile app, users saw a message saying, “You’ve been logged out.
