LUCIE – Many of the notes are handwritten or typed out years ago, but Glenn Sherlock is using them as a reference this spring as he helps coordinate camp under a former boss who wanted him back. The boss is Buck Showalter, who hired his old friend Sherlock as his bench coach weeks after becoming Mets manager in December. When Showalter managed at Double-A Albany in 1989, he gave Sherlock his first coaching job. Sherlock’s playing career was just about finished — he got as far as Triple-A as a catcher with the Yankees — and Showalter saw a superb student of the game who could help him. That partnership extended to the major leagues when Showalter got hired to manage the Yankees before the 1992 season. Sherlock followed as the catching instructor. Showalter later took Sherlock with him to Arizona upon becoming the Diamondbacks manager.
