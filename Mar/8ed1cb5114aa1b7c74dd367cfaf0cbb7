Rick Pitino earned a big win Wednesday, but he followed it with a devastating loss later that night. The Hall of Fame coach, who led Iona to the regular-season Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference title, was honored as the coach of the year, but his Gaels stunningly fell out of the conference tournament — and out of any chance at an NCAA Tournament bid — after a 71-70 loss to Rider in the quarterfinals in Atlantic City. “That was a great basketball game. Rider won it,” Pitino said, per the Albany Times-Union. “We didn’t play poorly. We played well. That’s the best we could play. So we’re just not that much better than any other team in the league. We just dominated the regular season because we won a lot of close games.” Dwight Murray Jr. made an off-balance shot in the lane with 7.3 seconds left to give the Broncs (14-19) the victory, their first over the Gaels (25-7) in three tries this season. Murray finished with 21 points. Tyson Jolly had 19 points to lead the Gaels (25-7). Elijah Joiner added 13 points for Iona, which had won the MAAC tournament 13 times. In his second season with Iona, the 69-year-old Pitino guided the Gaels to a 17-3 record in the MAAC to secure the top seed in the conference tournament. The Gaels, while going 13-0 at home, are now just 12-7 in road and neutral contests. — with AP
