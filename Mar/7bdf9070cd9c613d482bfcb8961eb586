Rudy Gobert wants Draymond Green to back up his claims about the French national team with evidence. Gobert spoke with Bleacher Report’s Taylor Rooks, and she read Green’s quote about the French national team to Gobert and asked him to respond. “They as the French national team have been very mouthy when it comes to us, but they don’t beat us when it matters,” Green said. “Playing as Team USA, it’s us against the world. And to hear guys like him and Evan Fournier get in the media and talk s–t as if they don’t already know how s–t goes pisses me off.” Gobert disputed the characterization. “Show me what s–t I talk,” he said. “I don’t talk s–t, so I want to see the evidence of me talking s–t. But, I love the competitiveness. I think in a way it’s cool that Team USA is getting mad at our team because they used to kick everyone’s ass for the last 30 years.” Green has long been critical of Gobert, most recently chastising the TNT crew after it compared the Warriors forward to the Jazz big man during the All-Star Game. In last year’s summer Olympics, Team USA defeated France 87-82 to win the gold medal. Gobert and Fournier led France with 16 points apiece.
