Who is obsessed with the cult-favorite beauty brand and their hallmark perfume scent? Well, if you’re reading this article, it’s probably “You.” Glossier You was the first and only eau de parfum from Glossier, and since it hit stores and the brand’s website back in 2017, many, including our editors at The Post, have become infatuated. Now, for a limited time only, that same scent will be available in a candle, sold in an exclusive bundle with a full-sized perfume, too. The Glossier More of You Kit ($78) comes with a full-size 50ml bottle of the perfume along with a 4oz Mini You Candle, sold together in a beautiful red tin and packaged in the matching pink bottle and vessel Glossier is known for. Like the perfume and the rest of their beauty products, the candle is cruelty-free, as well as being vegan and made from non-parrafin, vegetable-based wax. It burns for up to 72 hours, making your home smell just as irresistible as your skin after a spritz or two. Also like the perfume, the candle has the same scent profile, although it won’t react to your body chemistry like the perfume does when applied on the skin. “Glossier You is mainly made up of base notes on purpose; it lasts longer that way—and lets more of you into the equation,” reads the press release. It then lists the base and top notes as the following. “Ambrette Seeds: woody, warm, sweet; Ambrox: creamy, musky, salty; Pink Pepper: bright, sparkling, spicy; Iris: floral, green, powdery.” For those that love the scent, they also recently re-released the Glossier You Solid Perfume ($30), that has since sold out again— which is why we urge you to get the Glossier More of You Kit while you still can, as the fans have shown just how quickly this scent flies off the shelves.
