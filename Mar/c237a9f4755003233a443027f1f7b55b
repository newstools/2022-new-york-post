A serial shoplifter with dozens of arrests on his record told The Post “I steal for a living” after being released yet again on Thursday. Laron Mack’s shocking admission came after his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property charges. “I’m broke, I’m homeless and I steal for a living,” the 50-year-old man, in a tattered zip-up sweater, said while covering his face. Asked what he steals, Mack replied matter-of-factly: “Beer.” Authorities allege Mack and another man stole Bud Light, breakfast sausages and oatmeal from a Duane Reade on the Upper East Side on Wednesday. A worker at the store, on the corner of East 79th Street and Second Avenue, spotted the thieves putting their loot into a shopping bag and leaving without paying, according to a criminal complaint. Mack pleaded guilty during the hearing and was sentenced to conditional discharge. As part of the plea deal, he’ll have to complete three sessions with the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services (CASES) program. Mack was also busted on March 5 for allegedly grabbing a 12-pack of Modello and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups from a Duane Reade in Hamilton Heights the day prior, police said. Police say that out of Mack’s numerous arrests 30 are unsealed, most of them for low-level offenses such as petit larceny, which is not eligible for bail under state law. Stores across the Big Apple have seen a recent rash of thefts. Last month, a shoplifter scuffled with a security guard at a Manhattan Duane Reade — right in front of a Post journalist and photographer there to report on an earlier armed heist at the same store.
