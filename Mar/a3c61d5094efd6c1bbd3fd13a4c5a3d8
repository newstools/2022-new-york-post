A Virginia woman agreed Tuesday to stay clear of Apple CEO Tim Cook after she allegedly stalked him, begged him for sex and claimed he fathered her children. Julie Lee Choi, 45, will have to keep at least 200 yards away from the tech honcho for the next three years and can’t contact him through email, Twitter or other means, according to an agreement approved in a San Jose, Calif., court. The McLean resident had been slapped with a restraining order in January after bizarre behavior that included her twice showing up at Cook’s Palo Alto home and allegedly threatening she could “get violent,” court documents claimed. She had reportedly sent more than 200 emails to Cook, who is openly gay, and written about their purported relationship on social media. “I can’t live like this anymore,” Choi wrote in one email, according to the Associated Press. “I want sex with you, please, please.” Choi set up dummy companies using Apple’s address or listing Cooke as an agent or officer in an effort to connect her to the Apple head, the company alleged. The application for the restraining order accused Choi of sending Cook pictures of loaded pistols. She had reportedly claimed he was the father of her twins and went to his home twice in October. In one email in December, she offered to forgive Cook in exchange for $500 million in cash. Choi angrily waved off reporters outside the Santa Clara County courthourse on Tuesday and declined comment on the agreement to the AP. An Apple lawyer also declined comment to the news agency.
