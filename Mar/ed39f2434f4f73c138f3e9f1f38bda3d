Whether it’s clothes, furniture or toys, there’s always a bargain to be found on Facebook Marketplace. And one savvy woman, who is from the UK, was delighted when she came across a sofa that was being given away for free. The only problem being it was filthy and stained. Taking to TikTok, Mischa Pann, who is from the UK, shared a snap of the filthy grey two-seater that appeared in desperate need of some TLC. “Hi everyone, so I’m just going to show you how I flipped this sofa that I got for free on Facebook marketplace and made £200,” she penned. “So I took the cushion covers off and I stripped them in the bathtub. It was really gross.” Mischa then went on to explain how she bought a Bissell spot cleaning machine from Argos specifically for the project, with the hope of reusing it in the future. “So I gave the sofa a clean. I got all the stains out. Look at itttt,” she continued. “Then I had to get the cushion back in, that was hard.” The savvy homeowner then shared a snap of the sofa after it had received a spot of TLC — and it looks like it’s had a major glow up. “This is what it looks like,” she explained. “Put it up on eBay and it sold within a day for £200.” And many impressed social media users were quick to take to the comments section to praise Mischa on the simple transformation. “The sofa looks good as new!” enthused one. A second was keen to know what products Mischa used to clean the item of furniture, to which she responded: “Just detergent and some Biotex stain remover.” However, one person raged: “Can’t stand people like you. If I give my sofa away I want it to go to someone who can’t otherwise afford a sofa. It’s not for you to ‘flip’ & profit from.” Mischa replied: “What if you are a landlord and are selling your house, and can’t get it out of the flat. And someone with a van does you a favor and removes it?” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
