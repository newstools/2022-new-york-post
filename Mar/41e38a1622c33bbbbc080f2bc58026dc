Many brides have specific ideas for how they want their wedding to look, but one woman revealed the backlash she received after giving guests a color scheme. TikTok user Samantha Twist uploaded a video explaining how she had asked people to dress in a pastel shade for her big day. Samantha responded to a clip by another woman which said how they wanted to send a “dress code along with our invitations” asking for “light, earthy and neutral tones in their attire for the day”. Posting on her @samanthatwist account, the bride replied saying: “So I actually did this.” However, when she did it, it totally backfired on her, with some family members threatening to not come to the wedding. She explained: “I posted on our wedding website some examples and just said ‘hey I would like if you could wear something like this.’ “Also colours to avoid. “Basically everyone was outraged. “I got some much crap for posting this, one of my aunts even told me if I care so much about what she wears she is just not going to show up. “My mother-in-law was calling my husband, at the time my fiance, saying ‘what the heck is with Sam? “‘Does she not understand that people don’t have money to buy a whole new outfit?’ “Everyone basically thought I was the devil for asking them to wear near neutrals, although I think most people have grey or beige or navy blue in wardrobe.” She said the amount of calls she and her family got over the dress code was “insane”. Her video divided opinion, but one woman supported her, saying: “Our dress code was formal. “I honestly can’t stand people that show up in whatever to a wedding. It’s an important day, make an effort.” However, another slammed the idea, saying: “If you want to decide my outfit, you’ll need to pay for it.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
