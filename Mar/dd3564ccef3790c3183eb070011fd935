Cooper Kupp was more like Casper when it came to Peyton Manning’s text messages. The NFL’s Instagram account shared some quotes from a Twitter Spaces that Kupp did in November in which the eventual Super Bowl MVP revealed that he had been ghosting the text messages from one of the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. “I got a message from a random number with a picture of him and I was back at the Manning Passing Academy,” Kupp said at the time. “And I was like, ‘That’s so weird. Who would have this picture?'” Kupp eventually had a revelation. “I look back through the messages and they all line up with certain events where we’d seen each other,” Kupp said. “So I think I’ve been ghosting Peyton Manning for my entire NFL career.” Kupp commented on the NFL’s Instagram post on Tuesday: “My bad Peyton!” Selected in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft, Kupp has blossomed into arguably the best wide receiver in the league. With 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns, Kupp won the AP Offensive Player of the Year award before getting the nod as Super Bowl MVP on the championship-winning Rams this past season. Given what we heard recently from Eli Manning, about how his older brother has frustrating texting habits, Kupp’s story is a fun one to hear about the shoe being on the other foot.
