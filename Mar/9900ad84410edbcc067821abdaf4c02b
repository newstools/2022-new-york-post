Get your popcorn, folks: President Joe Biden’s popularity numbers are at an all-time low of 40% and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is rubbing his nose in it. In an interview with New York 1’s Errol Louis, AOC (D-Bx./Queens) warned the prez is risking the “collapse” of his support among progressives and young voters. His poll plummet “isn’t just about [a] middle-of-the-road, increasingly narrow band of independent voters,” she said, but “about the collapse of support among young people, among the Democratic base, feeling like they worked overtime to get this president elected and they aren’t necessarily being seen.” She imagines he can save himself by dictatorial stunts like canceling student debt, which she figures he has the “power and ability” to do via executive action. (And never mind that most of that debt is held by people from higher-income families.) She’s right, of course, that Republicans are poised to win back the House and Senate this November. But it’s largely his embrace of her agenda (and Bernie Sanders’) that’s driving Democrats’ woes. Lefties are the ones who pushed the “modern monetary policy” idea that Uncle Sam could spend endlessly without spurring inflation, who insisted Biden go to war on the US carbon-fuel industry, who demanded an insane rollback of border security and so on. Now America’s seeing the surging prices at the pump and everywhere else, plus an unending border crisis, that such policies invited. Zoomers may be unhappy that Biden didn’t do more, but far more of the voters who handed Dems complete control of Washington just wanted an end to the Trump drama. Contra the woke left, they want crime stopped and they don’t want their kids indoctrinated about “white supremacy culture.” Biden did his best to give AOC everything she wanted, and so drove the country into a ditch. But all she does is demand he dig himself even deeper. And they say the right is dysfunctional . . .
