Broadway-bound musical “KPOP” has officially set dates to dance its way onto the Great White Way. Producers Tim Forbes and Joey Parnes announced that the show will start previews at Circle in the Square Theatre on Oct. 13, 2022, and will have an official opening on Nov. 20, 2022, reported Deadline. “KPOP” will feature Korean superstar Luna, 28, who has been in the Korean productions of “Mamma Mia” and “In the Heights,” as well as several movies and TV shows. A member of the girl group f(x), she released a new single, “Madonna,” in September 2021, her first solo work in two years. “Anyone who has followed my career knows that musical theater has always been a driving passion of mine,” Luna said during a press conference on Wednesday. “Broadway represents the pinnacle of achievement in my profession, so being able to bring my culture – this Korean art form – to the fans who flock here from all over the world to see a Broadway show is the honor of my life,” she added. According to its official description, “KPOP” follows global superstars putting everything on the line for a special one-night-only concert as one singer’s inner struggle threatens to dismantle one of the biggest labels in the industry. “The driving force of this production of ‘KPOP’ has always been to fuse the vibrant, joyful and wildly entertaining world of K-pop with the powerful storytelling of a Broadway musical,” the producers said in a statement. “In the world of K-pop, no one embodies these elements better than Luna. We are thrilled to introduce Broadway audiences to one of the most exciting music superstars in the world.” As of now, there has been no word on other casting choices.
