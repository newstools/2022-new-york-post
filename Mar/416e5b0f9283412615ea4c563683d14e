Don La Greca will be back on the air Wednesday afternoon. After being hospitalized for pneumonia, “The Michael Kay Show” co-host had missed over a week of shows, but tweeted Wednesday that he would be making his return to the ESPN New York program at 5 p.m. “Doctor wants me to take it slow,” La Greca wrote. “I’ll try 2 hours today and see how it goes. See you then!” La Greca, 54, also does play-by-play for the Rangers and hosts the pre and postgame shows for ESPN 98.7 FM. It’s unclear if and when he will be returning to those duties. A New Jersey native, La Greca has co-hosted “The Michael Kay Show” since 2002. Kay retweeted his announcement and added a tweet of his own. “The man returns!” Kay tweeted. “@DonLagreca is easing back into action as he will join me and @Rosenbergradio for the final two hours of @TMKSESPN @TMKSYES today. He’s got a lot to say!”
