A thrilled wife revealed her husband got a vasectomy and she therefore presented him with a cake to celebrate. However, her sense of humor fell flat with many social media users who are now calling her “mean” and saying her husband can now easily cheat on her. The wife, lifestyle blogger, mother, and businesswoman, Sarah Landry, shared online that her husband went under the knife for the procedure on March 17. To celebrate, she got him a cake that read: “Sorry about your balls.” It was dressed with a pair of icing scissors and a sperm with a prohibition sign over it. “That was nice of me,” Landry concluded in her post. While some viewers got the joke and thought it was a light-hearted way to deal with the procedure, many others decided to troll Landry for her video. “Who in the world does that?” one shocked person questioned. “I would never get the snip. “If a woman asked me to, it would be the end of the relationship,” an unentertained man commented. “I know it’s a joke but this is not it,” another slammed, followed by an additional person calling her “mean.” Yet a fifth disgruntled viewer said: “It makes cheating so much easier. Greatest decision ever.” However, Landry didn’t seem to let the haters get to her and even responded to a few with sassy remarks. For instance, in reply to the person who told her “this is not it,” she said: “It actually is it. He got a vasectomy and I got him a cake. So nice of me.” Furthermore, she told people interested in learning more about the vasectomy experience that she will detail it in a podcast. Of course, all that matters is that Landry and her husband are happy with their choices – and it seems like they are totally unbothered by the hate.
