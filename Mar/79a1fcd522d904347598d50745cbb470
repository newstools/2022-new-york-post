Landon Collins says the Washington Commanders asked him to take a pay cut twice, which is why he’d rather test out free agency. Collins told CBS Sports on Thursday that Washington released him over a contract dispute. He was midway through the six-year, $84 million deal he signed with the Commanders in March 2019. “They asked me to take a pay cut,” the strong safety, 28, said. “The first one was fine. Then they asked me to take another one. The money changed after they signed Carson Wentz. I’ll just take my chances in free agency.” Collins was referencing Washington’s move to trade for the former Colts quarterback on Wednesday. His release will save the Commanders $6.6 million against the cap, but will create $9.6 million in dead money. Collins will hit the open market just days before the official start of free agency on March 16, which marks the beginning of the new NFL calendar year. He played in 13 games as a hybrid linebacker/safety in 2021 — having finished the season with 81 tackles, two interceptions, two fumble recoveries and three sacks. Collins returned after a torn Achilles sidelined him for more than half of his second season with the Commanders. He had 35 total starts over three seasons with Washington. Collins spent his first four NFL seasons with the Giants after New York selected him in the second round (33rd overall) of the 2015 draft. He made three Pro Bowls with the Giants, and was named first-team All Pro in 2016.
