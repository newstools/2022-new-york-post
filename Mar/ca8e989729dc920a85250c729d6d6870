Miller’s value to the Rangers increases or decreases in direct relation to the state of the club’s contract extension talks with Ryan Strome. If president-general manager Chris Drury is confident he will be able to keep the pending free agent beyond this season, there should be less urgency to acquire Miller and thus less need to pay the bounty the Canucks will require in order to move their best player. But if Drury is pessimistic about the direction of the on-off talks going on since early January and does not feel the club is close to brokering a consensus, the Blueshirts’ interest in reacquiring Miller should take on greater importance.
