Fox News star Greg Gutfeld revealed on the air that his mother-in-law is stranded in Ukraine as the embattled country is invaded by Russia. Gutfeld, a co-host of “The Five,” told his colleagues Wednesday that the mother of his wife is currently in a hotel in Lviv, a town in western Ukraine that lies about 43 miles from the border with Poland. During a segment with on-site reporter Lucas Tomlinson, Gutfeld, who was broadcasting from the network’s Manhattan studios, told him: “Well thank you, Lucas, you’re in Lviv, so is my mother-in-law.” He added: “I think she’s at your hotel. If you run into her, give her my best. Give everybody there my best.” To which Tomlinson replied: “She’s across the street.” “You’re doing great work, thank you,” Gutfeld told Tomlinson. He then went on to thank his colleagues for helping get his mother-in-law to safety. “I do want to point out that like our co-workers are unbelievably awesome, because the things that they have been doing for a grouchy, cynical bastard like myself,” Gutfeld said. “People have been helping me, and somebody who has been obnoxious to them before and will probably be obnoxious after.” Gutfeld continued: “These guys over there, I won’t name them, but you probably know who they are, and you’ve seen them, are absolute heroes helping out a little old lady they just met.” “And maybe by tomorrow or the next day, she will be with her daughter and it’s because of those guys who work for Fox News.” Gutfeld also credited Fox News war correspondent Trey Yingst as well as Steve Harrigan, the network’s former Moscow-based correspondent, and Scott Wilder, FNC’s vice president of field and production operations, for their assistance. Lviv is a city where many Ukrainians from other parts of the country have sought shelter after their towns were targeted with bombs by the Russian military. In the week since Russia launched its invasion, around 1 million people have been displaced, according to international agencies.
