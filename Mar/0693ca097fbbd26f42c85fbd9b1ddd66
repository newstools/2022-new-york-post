A Maryland man robbed a high-end clothing store in Soho Wednesday and crashed when cops tried to stop his getaway car — which had a stolen gun in it, authorities said. Daryl Michael Lashon Jackson, 26, from the city of Laurel, swiped about $2,115 in clothing from Moncler Soho on Prince Street around 1:05 p.m., police said. Responding officers were notified that Jackson fled in a 2018 Ford Explorer parked nearby, cops said. Cops spotted the vehicle and tried to conduct a car stop, but Jackson took off — driving recklessly and smashing into a Jeep SUV, which flipped at Broome Street and West Broadway, police said. Jackson got out of the Explorer and fled on foot, but was nabbed by officers on a post nearby, cops said. He was not hurt, but the Jeep driver was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. Cops found a gun, which was stolen from out of state, with an extended magazine, inside Jackson’s car, authorities said. The stolen clothing was also recovered in the vehicle, cops said. Jackson was hit with a slew of charges — including grand larceny, reckless endangerment, fleeing from an officer in a motor vehicle, criminal possession of stolen property and raps for possession of the gun and a large-capacity ammunition feeding device, police said. Moncler is best known for pricey down coats that can cost thousands of dollars each. The same store has been plundered in the past.
