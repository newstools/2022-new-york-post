A US Navy sailor allegedly gunned down his wife’s lover after catching the pair having sex in their Virginia home, court documents show. Tyler Lamar Jenkins, 26, was charged with second-degree murder in Friday’s fatal shooting of Timothy Paul Talley III, 28, at the married couple’s home in Virginia Beach, police said in a statement. Talley, of California, was struck multiple times during the “domestic related shooting” and was pronounced dead at the scene. Jenkins was taken into custody at his residence without incident, cops said. Jenkins’ wife told cops he entered a room where she was “engaged in a sexual act” with Talley, prompting her husband to open fire at her boyfriend, court documents obtained by the Virginian-Pilot show. “What am I doing wrong?” Jenkins asked at the scene after he told cops someone was having sex with his wife in their house, according to court records. Jenkins then admitted shooting Talley three times. The gun he used to kill his wife’s lover was recovered at the home, police said. Investigators did not disclose the relationship between the men in Saturday’s statement. Jenkins, who was arraigned Monday, has been employed by the US Navy since 2014, the Virginian-Pilot reported. A message seeking additional comment from a Navy spokesperson was not immediately returned Tuesday. Jenkins remains held without bond, online records show. He was reportedly denied a public defender due to his income and is set to appear in court on May 12. Attempts to reach Talley’s relatives Tuesday were unsuccessful.
