The quarterback carousel is spinning ’round. After the Indianapolis Colts traded Carson Wentz to the Washington Commanders for a package that includes two third-round picks, the question becomes what’s next for the Colts. According to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport, the Colts are expected to be “in the mix” to trade for 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. The Colts may have competition. Earlier this week, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported that a “wild rumor” making waves in league circles was that the Saints could be in play for Garoppolo. If a deal were to get done, this would likely mean a new destination for Jameis Winston. Other franchises seemingly in need of a starting QB include the Steelers, Panthers and Seahawks. This year’s NFL Draft class is not thought to be promising at the position. Garoppolo’s 49ers reached the NFC Championship game this past season, where they lost 20-17 to the Rams. Garoppolo, 30, started 15 regular-season games this past season, throwing for 8.6 yards per attempt, 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. It has been a wild week on the quarterback carousel. In addition to the Wentz trade, Aaron Rodgers is opting to remain in Green Bay for an 18th season, and Russell Wilson was traded from the Seahawks to the Broncos.
