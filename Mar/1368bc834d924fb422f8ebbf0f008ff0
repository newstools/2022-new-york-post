Wild dashcam video captures the moment a stranded motorist is forced to leap for his life as a truck barrels into an 18-wheeler during a deadly pileup on a Pennsylvania highway Monday. The footage shows the truck cruising along on a snow-covered Interstate 81 in Schuylkill around 11 a.m. when the massive pileup appears suddenly in front of the driver — too late for him to stop. He skids and slams into the stranded truck, one of the dozens of vehicles caught in the pileup that killed at least three people, the video posted on Facebook shows. The driver can then be heard moaning after the vehicle comes to a crashing halt. Authorities said a dangerous blend of snow and fog led to the pileup that shut down a section of the highway in rural Pennsylvania, state transportation officials said. The massive crash sent at least 24 people to area hospitals, with as many as 60 vehicles involved in the mayhem — several bursting into flames, WGAL-TV reported. The northbound lanes of the interstate remained shut between exits 107 and 119 late Monday as emergency crews worked to douse flames and clear vehicles, the outlet said.
