An off-duty NYPD cop was robbed of his gun and beaten during a fight with a group of other men in Hell’s Kitchen early Friday, cops said. The 42-year-old victim was outside the Hudson Market Place on Ninth Avenue near West 51st Street around 4:30 a.m. – joined by another man whose exact relationship with him is unclear,  police said. At some point, the pair got into a heated argument with four other men outside the deli that escalated to blows, cops said. During the fight, one of the men in the group snatched the off-duty officer’s firearm, police said. The group fled in a gray Dodge Charger heading south on Ninth Avenue. The cop was taken to Mount Sinai West, conscious and alert, with bruises and abrasions, police said. The other man went to Mount Sinai St. Luke’s in stable condition. No arrests were immediately made.
