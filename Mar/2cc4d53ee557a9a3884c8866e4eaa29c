Defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi won’t be signing with the Bears after all. Days after reports emerged that Chicago had agreed to a three-year, $40.5 million deal with the former third-round pick, the Bears announced Friday the deal was off due to a failed physical. “As I said before, Larry Ogunjobi embodies everything we are looking for in a Bear. He is a special person and player,” Ryan Poles, the Bears new general manager, said in a statement, per NBC Sports. “During the league’s negotiating window earlier this week, we agreed to terms with him, subject to him passing a physical here. After a standard and thorough physical and medical review with Larry yesterday afternoon, our medical team deemed him to have failed his physical and therefore, unfortunately, we are not signing him today. This is difficult and it is emotional for everyone involved, but ultimately is what is in the best interest of protecting the Chicago Bears.” Ogunjobi, 27, was originally drafted by the Browns in 2017 and signed a one-year deal with the Bengals last March. Though he started in 16 games for Cincinnati, he was placed on injured reserve in January after suffering a foot injury during the wild-card round of the playoffs. The Bears, meanwhile, are now signing former Chargers defensive tackle Justin Jones instead, NFL Network reported Friday.
