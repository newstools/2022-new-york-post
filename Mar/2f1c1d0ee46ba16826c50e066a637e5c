Providence took care of the South Dakota State Jackrabbits in their first game of the March Madness tournament, thanks in large part to a balanced attack that saw three players score 12 or 13 points. For their next act, they’ll host a twelve-seed Richmond Spiders team that pulled off a massive first round upset over the No. 5 Iowa Hawkeyes.

It will be even more meaningful for Providence native Ed Cooley. Ranked by analytics as the most overrated team in the country, the Friars have proven the computers’ inability to properly weigh late-game success. It isn’t random. It requires composure and cohesion. It is enhanced by the experience of these Big East champs. In what likely will be its latest back-and-forth game, Providence’s timely shooting and tough defense will be the difference in another win decided in the final minutes.
