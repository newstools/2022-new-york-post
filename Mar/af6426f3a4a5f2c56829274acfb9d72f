Even though Tuesday’s NBA slate features only four games, Joe Dellera of The Action Network has TWO best bets. The first contest interesting Dellera is the Phoenix Suns at the New Orleans Pelicans, who are a four-and-a-half point home underdog. Odds provided by BetMGM Even though the Suns will arrive in the Bayou without Chris Paul and Cam Johnson, Dellera believes this is a good matchup for Phoenix. “The Suns have the best adjusted net rating in the league — fourth-best in adjusted offensive rating and third-best in adjusted defensive rating,” Dellera explains. Plus, even though the visitors will be missing some key pieces, injuries have impacted the Pelicans too. Brandon Ingram will definitely miss Tuesday’s contest while C.J. McCollum is doubtful, too. As a result, Dellera believes this spread is too short and is backing the Suns as road favorites.  Odds provided by DraftKings For his second play, Dellera is choosing to target a total: the Nets’ team total over 31.5 first-quarter points against the Orlando Magic. Dellera’s thesis behind this play is that both teams play at a very fast pace – Orlando sits 10th in pace this season while the Nets are 12th — so he expects points early. “Over the past two weeks, the Nets are scoring 120.8 points per 100 possessions, which is the fifth-most in the league,” Dellera says. “And their starting lineup…is scoring a preposterous 135 points per 100 possessions.” Given that particular lineup ranks in the upper echelon of the league, Dellera expects the Nets’ starting five will have its way against an average Magic defense, which sits 17th in adjusted defensive rating.
