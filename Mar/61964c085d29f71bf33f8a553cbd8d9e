Follow the yellow brick road… to collect an iconic movie prop. Over 80 years after the groundbreaking Warner Bros. film “The Wizard of Oz” graced the silver screens, a prized piece from the set is going up for auction for the very first time. The Tin Man’s oil can from the 1939 technicolor fantasy is being sold for $200,000, according to TMZ. Kruse GWS Auctions is holding the sale and noted on the product description page that film historians say this is one of five oil cans used during filming, while other experts say there were three. The container can be seen at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles. The can is currently on loan to the museum through November 2022. According to the auction house, the museum was also interested in letting the winning bidder keep the golden prop at the gallery after the loan agreement is satisfied in November. The item will come with a redacted copy of the loan agreement for the Academy Museum as well as an insurance appraisal of $1 million. The iconic musical starred Judy Garland as the wide-eyed Dorothy, with Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton completing the ensemble cast. Garland’s blue gingham dress from the movie was finally found last year after being missing for almost 50 years. The costume was mysteriously lost in 1972 and was found on the Catholic University campus in Washington, DC in June 2021. The college’s lecturer and operations coordinator for drama and music, Matt Ripa, unearthed the dress as he was cleaning out an area of one of the school’s buildings. Ripa discovered a shoebox containing the blue-and-white dress in a trash bag and the university has been keeping the gown safe in its archives.
