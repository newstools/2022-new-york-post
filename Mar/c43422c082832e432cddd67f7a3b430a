A sicko who allegedly smeared his own feces on a straphanger’s face was freed without bail Wednesday on a fresh set of hate crime charges. Frank Abrokwa was hauled before a judge for the second time in as many days — this time on charges he spat on a Jewish man and chased him down a Brooklyn street, screaming, “Come here, you f—king Jew, I am going to kill you,” according to a criminal complaint. The alleged hate crime happened Sept. 9 in Crown Heights. The career criminal — who is accused of rubbing his excrement in a woman’s face in the Bronx last week — is charged with second-degree aggravated harassment as a hate crime, disorderly conduct and two counts of menacing, including one as a hate crime. But bail couldn’t be set on any of those charges, including the top felony count of aggravated harassment, as per the state’s new bail reform laws that nix the cash option for many charges, authorities said. Abrokwa, 37, was sprung on supervised release, according to a spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office. He was freed Tuesday night in the Bronx feces attack because the charges are also not bail-eligible — even despite prosecutors’ request that he be held on $15,000 bond or $5,000 cash. But Abrowka didn’t make it far. Cops promptly arrested him in connection to the hate crime case after he was released. The sickening attack was caught on video, showing Abrowka allegedly slapping a bag filled with his own excrement in the 43-year-old victim’s face on Feb. 21 after she apparently rebuffed him. “Instead of taking the lack of engagement in stride, the defendant responded with violence,” Bronx prosecutors said. “He walked into a nearby idling subway car and defecated in a bag.” Sources said Abrowka has nearly two dozen unsealed arrests dating back to 1999, including for assault in January and February.
