Glen “Big Baby” Davis’ viral moment last week appears to have gotten him into trouble. Davis was shown on TV getting kicked out of a courtside seat he’d apparently pilfered from another fan on Mar. 6, when the Celtics were hosting the Nets on national TV on ABC. The ex-Celtics player — Davis won a championship with Boston in 2008 — is out on bail as one of the dozen former NBA players who allegedly submitting false medical claims to the league’s benefits ban, Darren Heitner, a sports business attorney, noticed last week that Davis had apparently violated the terms of his bail in traveling to Boston. Heitner relayed that Davis’ attorney petitioned the Southern District of New York to allow his client to travel to Boston for work to perform comedy shows. Davis was supposed to appear on the radio program “Toucher & Rich” on 98.5 the Sports Hub in Boston this Friday. Per the hosts, he had to cancel due to a court appearance. “We were told the reason Big Baby couldn’t come in studio this morning is because he was in court,” the “Toucher & Rich” Twitter account shared. “If [Heitner’s tweet] is true, the reason is because he violated his bail to sit on the court at the Celtics/Nets game.”
