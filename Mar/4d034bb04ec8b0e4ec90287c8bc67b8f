Former three-term New York Gov. George Pataki is leading a delegation to provide humanitarian relief to 200,000 Ukrainian refugees who’ve fled to neighboring Hungary following Russia’s invasion of their homeland. “We have money, food, clothing and medical supplies we can deliver,” Pataki, whose paternal grandparents were from Hungary, told The Post on Tuesday. He said he will visit the Hungary-Ukraine border town of Kisvárda after landing in Budapest on Thursday. He also expects to meet with top Hungarian officials as well as the leader of the country’s Catholic Church, Cardinal Peter Erdo. “We want to assess what it’s like at the border and fill any holes so the refugees are getting the help they need. I think it’s crucial to be there,” said Pataki, who help lead New York’s recovery following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Pataki will officially announce the humanitarian relief effort at 2 p.m. Wednesday at the Consulate General of Ukraine in Manhattan. He will be accompanied by Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation and officials from the Archdiocese of New York.

Pataki’s delegation, organized through his not-for-profit Pataki Leadership Center, will also include former Ambassador to Finland Earle Mack and industrialist Peter Brant. He said people of goodwill who believe in freedom and democracy must help defeat Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. “Putin is the epitome of evil. I’m disappointed it took so long to stop buying Russian oil,” said Pataki, referring to President Biden’s announced ban on Russian energy products earlier Wednesday.
