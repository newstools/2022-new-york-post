An NYPD cop opened fire on a vehicle that tried to run him down in Brooklyn on Thursday night, law enforcement sources told The Post. A sergeant working as a Public Safety Team supervisor tried to pull over a suspected stolen car on Avenue J and East 39th Street in the East Flatbush neighborhood at just before 9 p.m., sources said. That’s when a second car tried to hit the sergeant, who fired a shot at the driver, sources said. Two people have reportedly been arrested but a third person fled on foot, according to the sources. Police were searching the area and canvassing local hospital emergency rooms and the person was suspected to have sustained a gunshot wound, the sources added.
