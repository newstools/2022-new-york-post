I feel like in the end, everyone’s going to have regrets of some sort.” Julie explained there were top five regrets people often confessed to when dying. She said: “Most people at the end of their lives have regrets about not appreciating their health. “Not appreciating being alive, the little things. “Working their life away. “And not spending more time with family.” From her patient’s confessions, Julie has learned to “Be in the moment, live presently, be grateful, don’t take for granted your health, and little things about living life. “Don’t work your life away if you don’t have to, or make it so you don’t have to. “Spend time with those you love, not necessarily family, but those you love and make you feel loved.
