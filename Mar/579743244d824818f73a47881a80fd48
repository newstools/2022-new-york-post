A hospice nurse has revealed what she has learned from caring for people who are dying. Julie, from the US, revealed that in her experience, many people have the same regrets about life when their time on this Earth is coming to an end. The hospice nurse uses her TikTok account to help educate people on death, busting common myths and sharing experiences she’s had on the job. In one TikTok video posted to her account, Hospice nurse Julie, she revealed the common regrets her patients have had. Julie posted the video in the hopes that people watching would take her advice so they would not have the same regrets when looking back on their lives. The nurse responded to a question: “What kind of regrets do you hear? I feel like in the end, everyone’s going to have regrets of some sort.” Julie explained there were five top regrets people often confessed to when dying. She said: “Most people at the end of their lives have regrets about not appreciating their health. “Not appreciating being alive, the little things. “Working their life away. “And not spending more time with family.” From her patients’ confessions, Julie has learned to “Be in the moment, live presently, be grateful, don’t take for granted your health, and little things about living life. “Don’t work your life away if you don’t have to, or make it so you don’t have to. “Spend time with those you love, not necessarily family, but those you love and make you feel loved.” Julie became a hospice nurse after working in intensive care for nine years. Viewers of the video were grateful for the advice, with one writing: “thank you I needed to hear that.” “Maam, this was inspirational. Thank you for sharing your knowledge when you didn’t have to. It’s appreciated,” another viewer commented. A third added: “I needed to hear this today. thank you, Julie.” This story originally appeared on the Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
