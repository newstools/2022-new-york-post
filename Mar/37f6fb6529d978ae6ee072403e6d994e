At least the housemates are quiet — and always will be. This former church in southern England — now a home listing for roughly $956,000 in US dollars — is certainly a stunner. Listing images show elegant period details, including stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings. But outside, the faint of heart may be in for a bit of a spook. Located in the village of Chilcompton some 12 miles from the historic city of Bath, the church’s graveyard remains in what’s now the home’s rear garden — with its tombs still there. The graves reach 200 years in age — and, according to Caters News, it’s fair to say no one visits them any longer. But if the living wish to stop by, they’re required to submit a written request to the owner in order to pay their respects. “The main draw to the house is … how big it really is inside,” branch manager Samuel Masters of the listing agency Cooper and Tanner told Caters. “The garden is a compromise to some, but the other features make it a great home.” The property itself dates to 1800. Formerly an operational church, the building fell into a state of disrepair in later years. But in the mid-1980s, the architect Warwick Rodwell converted it into a residence, calling it Downside Old Church. The home has three bedrooms, and other original features include the church’s main doors, an altar that leads to a living area, plus a nave accented with columns underneath. As for updates, the kitchen — which has the church’s vaulted ceilings — now comes with skylights. It’s all visibly well-outfitted and maintained. “The strong colors inside and the way it has been well decorated eradicates any cold and spooky feelings of a church and gives a warm and cozy feeling to the home,” said Masters.
