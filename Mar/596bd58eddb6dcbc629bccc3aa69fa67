A 33-year-old man was gunned down in Brooklyn on Sunday night — and police later captured a suspect in the fatal shooting, sources and the NYPD said. The victim was shot five times at around 6:40 p.m. in front of 783 Hicks St. in Red Hook, according to police and sources. The suspect, a 20-year-old male, fled the scene, but was detained by officers later Sunday night, cops said. No charges were immediately filed. A motive in the fatal shooting was unclear. Six shell casings were recovered on scene, sources said. A black, semi-automatic gun was also found a short distance away from the shooting, according to the sources.
