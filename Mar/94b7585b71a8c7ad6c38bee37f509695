When Nicci and Kelsie Garlic tied the knot in 2014, the couple knew they wanted to have kids right away. But after three years of trying and several rounds of IVF, the couple — who first met at high school in Illinois — had to come to terms with the fact that parenthood might not be for them. Instead, Kelsie, 33, and Nicci, 34, threw themselves into fostering kids and have been looking after two brothers (aged four and six) in the hopes of becoming their long-term guardians. Last month, the teacher started experiencing unusual stomach pain while at school. As she thought it was kidney stones, Nicci took herself to a nearby medical facility — who informed her that she was almost nine months pregnant. The news came as a total shock as they’d stopped trying to get pregnant after Nicci’s last period in 2020. Naturally, the first thing the mum-to-be did was call her husband. She told him: “Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I’m f***ing pregnant. Not only am I pregnant, but I’m 34 weeks pregnant.” But that wasn’t the only surprise in store for the couple that evening. Nicci was then diagnosed with preeclampsia, which is characterised by high blood pressure and damage to another organ, often the kidneys or liver. As a result, doctors wanted to deliver the baby right away and Nicci welcomed her son via C-section 10 hours after she arrived in hospital. Kelsie said: “I’ve never ever felt this way. Granted, it’s my first newborn. “We both wanted a family. This was not a mistake. We’ve been wanting this since we got married. “So for this to happen to us, oh man, it’s just unbelievable. It’s unbelievable.” As Charlie’s arrival was a total surprise, the couple have set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of raising their “miracle baby” and have raised a staggering £35,000.
