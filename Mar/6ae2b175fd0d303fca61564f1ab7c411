President Biden committed another gaffe Tuesday — referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as “the first lady.” Biden made the mix-up while noting Harris wasn’t with him at an event because her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in the day. “There’s been a little change in arrangement of who is on the stage because of the first lady’s husband contracting COVID,” Biden said, according to a video of the snafu posted to Twitter. Somebody off to Biden’s side then appears to correct the president — eliciting laughter from those in attendance. The White House revealed Emhoff’s positive test just before 6 p.m. Harris, who spent the day with Biden before the announcement, tested negative. Emhoff is the latest high-profile Democrat to contract the virus. Former President Barack Obama, 60, disclosed Sunday that he tested positive.
