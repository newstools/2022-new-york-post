Three people were hurt in separate shootings early Saturday across the five boroughs, police said. Around 7:30 a.m., a motorist was shot in the back and leg following a dispute with another driver near Exit 6 on the Jackie Robinson Parkway. The man, 28, was taken to Brookdale Hospital in stable condition, according to an NYPD spokesman. The alleged shooter took off westbound in a “white vehicle,” police said. The gunfire followed two earlier incidents. Around 2:39 a.m. near the United Nations, a man was shot once in the stomach during a dispute with an unknown shooter, according to cops. He is expected to survive. The alleged shooter, who fled, was wearing a blue jacket, white sweatshirt, white sneakers and khaki pants. About 45 minutes earlier on Staten Island, a 25-year-old man reported being shot from behind while sitting in his vehicle at Richmond Terrace and Van Pelt Avenue, according to the NYPD. The victim — who was hit in the back but is expected to survive — told cops that “he was seated in his vehicle when he heard gunshots and felt pain.” No information is available on the perpetrator.
