Count LaGuardia HS for the Performing Arts as yet another casualty in the war on excellence. How long will it take new Chancellor David Banks to reverse the school system’s bias against achievement? Students and parents at the “Fame”ous school just learned that its Advanced Placement Calculus class lost College Board accreditation this year. Worse, some teachers have reportedly discouraged kids from taking AP exams. This, a year after parental outcry supposedly got the school to drop plans to undermine its AP offerings. AP classes are a huge win for kids, since they can earn college credits if they pass the corresponding test and save big money if they finish faster. How is discouraging them from taking the test helping students? It’s been a tug of war: Lisa Mars was forced out as LaGuardia principal in 2019 after some students, parents and faculty found her to be too focused on academics. That ushered in new leadership that attacked AP classes as supposedly too stressful for kids and insufficiently creative (or something) for teachers. The real issue seems to be the woke idea that high achievement is a “manifestation of white supremacy.” A PowerPoint presentation last year told families that “colleges acknowledge that standardized test scores reflect systemic racism rather than student achievement.” All this is an insane disservice to kids. Banks, who rightly says increasing chances for students to excel is vital to restoring parental trust, should order a review of LaGuardia’s leadership and course offerings. Any so-called educator who embraced the de Blasio-era assault on excellence should be shown the door.
