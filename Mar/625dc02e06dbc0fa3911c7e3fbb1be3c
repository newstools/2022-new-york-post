The Lakers’ struggles have Charles Barkley so disgusted that he refuses to say the team’s name out loud. During Thursday’s episode of “Inside the NBA,” Barkley vowed to not talk about the struggling team. While discussing the their 132-11 loss to the rival Clippers Thursday on TNT, Barkley called the LeBron James-led squad “that team from Southern California.” He declared, “I am not talking about these damn losers. Between the nitwits at TNT and the nitwits at ESPN, we talk about these losers more than any people in the world.” Barkley’s rant came after co-host Shaquille O’Neal sent a stern warning to the Lakers about James during an appearance on CNBC earlier this week. Barkley said the Lakers could earn their name back by winning a playoff game. However, they’ll have to make it to the postseason first. Right now, the 27-35 Lakers are the No. 9 seed in the Western Conference, just two games clear of the Blazers, who are in 11th place and outside the play-in game window. The postseason begins April 16. The Lakers have 20 games left to turn things around, but their struggles have kept them teetering around the ninth and tenth seed. Their Russell Westbrook problem won’t be addressed until the summer, according to Bleacher Report, which said Wednesday that the first-year Laker and the team have “mutual interest” about moving him in the offseason. The point guard has been a turnover machine for months, and can’t seem to escape the offensive rut he’s in. While James has maintained confidence that he can lead the Lakers out their season-long slump, the team is still without Anthony Davis. The big man has struggled through injuries this season, and is currently working his way back from a mid-foot sprain he suffered last month in a win over the Jazz. The Lakers’ latest loss to the Clippers marked their fourth straight — and second consecutive loss to their L.A. rival in a one-week span. James and Co. play host to Steph Curry and the Warriors on Saturday.
