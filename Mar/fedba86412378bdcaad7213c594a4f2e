Former Islanders defenseman Jean Potvin died on Tuesday night at the age of 72, the team announced. A cause of death was not provided. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Potvin family,” general manager Lou Lamoriello said in a statement. “Jean was a leader on the ice, helping the organization win two Stanley Cup Championships. He made his home on the Island and was always such a friendly face in our community. We send our sincere condolences to all those who grieve his loss.” Jean, whose brother Denis was a Hall of Fame defenseman for the team, had an 11-year NHL career, playing the bulk of it with the Islanders. He also had stints with the Kings, Flyers, Cleveland Barons and Minnesota North Stars. His final two seasons were the Islanders’ first two Stanley Cup years, in 1980 and 1981. He finished his career with 46 goals and 167 assists. He also holds the distinction of being the only Islander defenseman other than his brother to score a hat trick. Potvin also worked on Islanders radio broadcasts for eight years following the end of his playing career. A native of Ottawa, Potvin continued to be involved in the Long Island community for years following his retirement. He served on the Nassau County Boy Scouts of America Board of Directors for over a decade and worked with Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens. His is survived by his wife, Lorraine, and his children Kim, Leslie and Justin.
