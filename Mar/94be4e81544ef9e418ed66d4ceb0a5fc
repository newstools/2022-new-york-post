You probably never pay a second thought to your Amazon delivery driver but one employee has revealed they have plenty of opinions about you. TikTok user Revengekkid often shares secrets of the job on his account and recently revealed the three most-annoying types of customers he encounters. Speaking in the video, he shared that his biggest bugbear is shoppers who have packages delivered to Amazon lockers. He says: “People that ask for their package to be delivered to the locker but don’t have their name registered to the locker. Like what the f***. “If that happens we either need to go office and ask for the number of your guy’s apartment or go find the apartment – the office is not going to take the packages or leave them there for you guys.” Other customers that get under the delivery man’s skin are company deliveries. “Businesses,” he says, “Business stops are pretty bad depending on the business. “I had a supermarket last week, it was a b***h to even find parking during grocery hours, it was completely packed. “I finally go in and get to the desk and they tell me I have to go to the office to give them the package. I don’t know where the office is, I don’t work there.” His final grievance lay with one particular delivery location. The driver explained: “Garage deliveries are not the worst thing in the world but they do take up a little more time than a normal delivery would. “Half the time it doesn’t even work so we’re putting it at the door half the time anyway.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
