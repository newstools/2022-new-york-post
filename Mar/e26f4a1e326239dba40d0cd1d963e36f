An optical illusion depicting a cat could reveal more about your true personality, a test claims. The illusion asks onlookers to look at the direction that the animal is traveling and claims it says something important about you. The greyscale image shared by The Minds Journal depicts a cat on a flight of stairs. Whichever way you see the cat walking exposes your approach to life, it claims. Both viewpoints are said to have definitive meanings. If you felt that the cat was coming up the stairs, chances are that you have an optimistic view of life. “You see potential and you see growth wherever you look,” the Minds Journal article says. “Your mind has been trained to look at ways of rising higher in life, so given a situation where you have the choice of rising higher than others or falling to their levels, you would inevitably be the better person. “There are clear signs of ambition in you and no one, except yourself, can stop you from going higher in life. If you observed the cat walking down the stairs, you have a personality that is pessimistic and skeptic. “It may have been based on your experiences in life or just because of the sort of people you may have met that tilted your view of life towards the negative side,” The Minds Journal article says. “But this means that you don’t trust easily now, you calculate before you commit and you are wary of people who seem too sweet. “It may just be your way of tackling the world but you are much sharper and shrewd in your dealings, making it almost impossible to trick or deceive you.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
