Lou Lamoriello doesn’t sound like someone about to embark on a teardown. “I have a real strong belief in this core,” Lamoriello told reporters about the Islanders. “There’s no question of that.” The Isles have had a disastrous season, sitting out of playoff contention with a team that was meant to contend for the Stanley Cup. Across the board, players have underperformed, though external factors — a 13-game road trip to start the season and a poorly timed COVID-19 outbreak — have certainly contributed to their issues. “We’ve had some players this year have slow starts in areas that they were supposed to be proficient in,” Lamoriello said. “We’ve got scorers who are supposed to score and we’ve got other people that are supposed to play different roles. We haven’t had that on a consistent basis, it’s obvious. I’m not going to sugarcoat it.” Ahead of the March 21 trade deadline, Cal Clutterbuck, Zach Parise, Zdeno Chara and Andy Greene are the only Islanders set to hit unrestricted free agency over the summer. Goaltender Semyon Varlamov could also fetch interest, with his contract set to expire in 2023. But it seems unlikely that any of their core pieces will be moving. “I certainly know where we stand,” Lamoriello said. “I also know what I believe our abilities are. I’ll just take right now a day at a time until we get to the point where decisions have to be made. I do not think any different at this time than I would think if we were, say, in a playoff spot today, or out of a playoff spot, because there are so many things that you think of. Everything you do is for today, with tomorrow in sight. That will never change.”
