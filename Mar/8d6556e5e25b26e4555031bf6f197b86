Central Park could mark a record high temperature this weekend, forecasters said. The mercury on Sunday could get as high as 72, breaking a record of 68 degrees set in 1935, Fox Weather meteorologist/producer Marissa Lautenbacher said. “The warmer temperatures are because of a front that’s coming through, bringing up a lot of southerly air,” she said. That means “spring-like temperatures,” more typical of May than early March. But it won’t necessarily be a great day to go outside: Sunday will also likely see some “showers, very likely, and some patchy fog,” she said. Monday will be warm too — with highs in the upper 60s — before things cool off into the week again.
