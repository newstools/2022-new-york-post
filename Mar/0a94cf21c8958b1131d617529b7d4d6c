Apple is reportedly slashing iPhone and AirPods production as surging inflation and and the war in Ukraine put a damper on demand for gadgets. Apple has told manufacturers that it’s cutting output of budget iPhone SEs, which were upgraded earlier this month, by about 20% during April through June, Nikkei reported on Monday. The cut amounts to 2 to 3 million iPhones, sources told the Japanese newspaper. Apple is also ordering 10 million fewer AirPods than anticipated in 2022, according to Nikkei. Apple sold about 77 million AirPods last year. One executive at an Apple supplier attributed Apple’s production cuts to would-be customers, especially in Europe, saving cash for essentials. “The war has affected spending at the European markets,” the executive told Nikkei. “It is understandable [consumers will] save the money for food and for heating.” Apple shares opened down 1.5% on Monday following Nikkei’s report even as the broader market remained relatively flat. The slump amounted to rain on Tim Cook’s parade after Apple’s film “CODA” became the first streaming service-backed flick to win an Oscar for best picture during the Academy Awards on Sunday night. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities and Apple bull, told The Post that the reported production cuts amount to “usual seasonal trims of production and nothing more,” adding that demand for the pricey iPhone 13 remains strong. “We view this as typical Apple seasonality, although the haters will try to make a mountain out of a molehill with this news,” Ives said.
