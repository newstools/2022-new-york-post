Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Poland and Romania next week in a show of support for the NATO allies amid Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Harris will visit the national capitals Warsaw and Bucharest in a trip beginning Wednesday and lasting through March 11. “Her visit will demonstrate the strength and unity of the NATO Alliance and U.S. support for NATO’s eastern flank allies in the face of Russian aggression,” the White House said in a statement Friday. “It will also highlight our collective efforts to support the people of Ukraine.” Late last month, President Biden dispatched the veep on a peace mission to the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Russian President Vladimir Putin proceeded with the invasion of Ukraine shortly after that trip. Republican members of Congress ridiculed the visit, pointing to Harris failing to halt the ongoing US-Mexico border crisis as Biden’s migration czar. The White House said that the VP will meet with the leaders of Poland and Romania next week and “advance our close coordination in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.” “They will discuss our continuing support for the people of Ukraine through security, economic, and humanitarian assistance and our determination to impose severe economic consequences on Russia and those complicit in Russia’s invasion.” Biden spoke by phone Friday with Polish President Andrzej Duda. A White House readout of that call did not mention Harris’ trip.
