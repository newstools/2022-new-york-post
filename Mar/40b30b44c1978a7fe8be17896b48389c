Time in the joint, indeed! New York State officials plan to initially limit eligibility for highly lucrative marijuana dispensary licenses to those previously convicted on pot-related offenses before the drug was legalized, documents show. Draft regulations likely to be adopted by the Cannabis Control Board at its meeting Thursday would limit eligibility to operators where at least one applicant was convicted — or immediately related to someone swept up before marijuana’s legalization. “If the applicant is an individual, or an entity with one or more individuals, at least one individual must be justice involved,” the bureaucratese states. ‘Justice involved’ covers anyone convicted of a pot-related charge, “had a parent, legal guardian, child, spouse, or dependent who was convicted,” or “was a dependent of an individual who was convicted of a [marijuana]-related offense,” the draft rules state. The regulations also would allow non-profits to qualify for a license if they can prove they “serve justice involved individuals and communities with historically high rates of arrest, conviction, incarceration or other indicators of law enforcement activity for [marijuana]-related offenses;” have an established track-record of creating jobs for returned convicts; and if they employ “justice involved” New Yorkers on their boards or in their executive leadership. Legalization advocates applauded the proposed rules in a statement to local cable network New York 1, which first reported the news. “The people that have fought for this change have been the people in New York that have been criminalized by the law, who have had their communities surveilled and punished,” said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.
