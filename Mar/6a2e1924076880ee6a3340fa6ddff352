New and growing data suggest that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is preventing COVID infections, hospitalizations and deaths as least as well as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, if not better. Too bad the Biden Food and Drug Administration undermined confidence in the jab. As of Jan. 22, The New York Times reports the unvaxxed were 3.2 times as likely to become infected as those who got the J&J jab; the number fell to just 2.8 times against those getting both doses of Moderna and 2.4 times for those with two Pfizer shots. Sadly, the FDA undermined confidence in the J&J shot (and in all vaccines) with its “pause” of the vaccine in April 2021. The fear was reports of blood clotting among those who got the jab, but they only numbered six cases out of (then) 7 million administered doses. The bureaucrats panicked not over a health threat, but at the thought they might get slammed for making a mistake in OK’ing the vaccine. In reality, the one-shot jab is crucial in vaccinating those who find shots of any kind scary or inconvenient. Plus, it can store (refrigerated) for months, far longer than the other two shots. It will likely be crucial to getting the people of Africa jabbed; only about 13% are fully vaccinated. America really, really needs something like the 9/11 Commission to look into the pandemic failures of the FDA, CDC and the rest of the nation’s public-health establishment.
