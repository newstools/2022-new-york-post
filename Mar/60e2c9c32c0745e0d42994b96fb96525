The driver accused of running over a man while doing donuts over the weekend during an illegal event in Soho surrendered to police Wednesday, cops said. Tyler Greer, 22, was charged with assault, leaving the scene of an accident and reckless driving for the incident on Saturday night, police said. Christopher Brito, 23, was struck by the vehicle as it made the dangerous moves near a group of bystanders and had to undergo multiple surgeries, his mother said. The red car had distinctive lettering on its side that said Tyler. Mom Jacqueline Brito, 48, told The Post her son needed to have surgery on two broken hips, his forehead and his nose. “It’s horrible,” she said. “His forehead is broken and his nose is broken too.”
