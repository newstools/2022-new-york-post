A multi-day manhunt ended Tuesday in Oklahoma after an inmate who escaped from a state facility on Sunday and was discovered roughly 25 miles away asking strangers if he could use a phone, officials said. Frank Logan, 56, slipped away from the Oklahoma State Reformatory in Granite on Sunday, when he was discovered missing during a 6 p.m. inmate count, the state Department of Corrections (ODOC) said in a press release. A spokesperson for the agency said Tuesday investigators were still looking into how he was able to escape. He was nabbed on Tuesday, less than 48 hours later, after a member of the public called 911 that morning to report that he saw someone matching Logan’s description “approaching people asking to use a phone,” the ODOC said. The ODOC had described him as being a White man with “low-cut balding hair and a goatee.” He weigh about 200 pounds and standing at 5-foot-10. He has a known link to the United Aryan Brotherhood and has swastika tattoos on his upper back and right upper arm and other tattoos on his torso. He allegedly goes by the aliases “Tony Crisp” and “Tony A. Crider.” Logan, who has been in ODOC custody since at least 1987, is currently serving multiple sentences, including 60 years for a prior escape from imprisonment, the department said. He has since been booked into the Jackson County jail and faces more felony charges for the escape, officials said.
