Secret Service agents arrested two men in Washington, DC, Thursday on weapons charges after appearing to remove an assault-style rifle from their car, according to a report. The men were cuffed by authorities in the Georgetown neighborhood Thursday afternoon and taken into custody. They apparently had body armor in their car, which has Marine Corps veteran plates from Indiana, according to a Reuters reporter who witnessed the bust. The Secret Service confirmed the two men were arrested on firearms charges after displaying suspicious behavior in the tony DC neighborhood. The Secret Service has yet to comment on the incident in the tony DC neighborhood, and video reviewed by Reuters shows police removing multiple army green military-style bags from the men’s black Ford sedan. One of the suspects was hauled away in a Secret Service vehicle. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. With Post wires
