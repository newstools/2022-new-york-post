Marwin Gonzalez hasn’t had much time to stand out since joining the Yankees last week, but he has been good since arriving at camp. The switch hitter homered for the second time and started at second base before moving to left field in Sunday’s 7-4 win over Pittsburgh at Steinbrenner Field. “I don’t think you expect results right away like he’s gotten,’’ manager Aaron Boone said. “He got to that fastball [on Sunday]. That’s one of his calling cards. He didn’t do that as much last year.” Gonzalez is coming off consecutive subpar seasons at the plate, but the Yankees value his versatility. With Gonzalez at second on Sunday, Gleyber Torres started at shortstop. Even if Gonzalez makes the team as a bench player, with the ability to back up Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Boone said he may still turn to Torres at short on occasion, even after his issues there last season, which led to his return to second base. “It depends what the day brings,’’ Boone said of who he might start at short on days Kiner-Falefa is unavailable, with the decision likely based on matchups. Torres got to a ball up the middle on Sunday, but was unable to make the throw to first in time. He also picked up another hit to improve to 6-for-17 this spring. Jordan Montgomery came in after Gerrit Cole left and threw 2 ²/₃ scoreless innings, with no walks and five strikeouts in the 55-pitch outing. It helped him put his rough debut against the Blue Jays in the rearview mirror, something he did with the help of some video review of that outing. The left-hander said he noticed the timing in his delivery was off in that first outing in Dunedin, Fla., and he was able to fix it by Sunday. Boone said he’s considering having more flexibility in the outfield this season. In addition to using Giancarlo Stanton there more often, there’s a chance Aaron Hicks could play left field on occasion and Joey Gallo may see time in center. Both might see time in the new spots this spring.
