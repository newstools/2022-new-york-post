PALM BEACH, Fla. – The Jets added another one of Robert Saleh’s former players on Monday. The team agreed to a deal with defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, according to a source. Thomas was the No. 3 overall pick by the 49ers in 2017 and spent four seasons in San Francisco with Saleh, who was the team’s defensive coordinator. Thomas, 26, played for the Raiders last season. He had 3.5 sacks, a career high. The 6-foot-3, 280-pounder has 9.5 career sacks. Thomas suffered a torn ACL in Week 2 of the 2020 season against the Jets and missed the rest of that year. He has played 65 games, starting 30. Thomas is the latest of Saleh’s former players to sign with the Jets. They also signed guard Laken Tomlinson and cornerback D.J. Reed, both former 49ers, in free agency. Saleh spoke to the media on Monday morning, before the Thomas deal, but he spoke about bringing players in that are familiar with his coaching. “There’s a saying that you want guys who can help you plant the flag in terms of the messaging and all that stuff,” Saleh said. Thomas is another flag bearer for Saleh.
