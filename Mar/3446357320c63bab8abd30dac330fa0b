The NL East arms race continues to heat up this offseason. Nick Castellanos is headed to the Philadelphia Phillies, according to multiple reports. ESPN’s Jeff Passan was first on the news, and MLB Network’s Jon Heyman added that the deal was worth $100 million over five years. This comes on the heels of the Phillies signing Kyle Schwarber to a four-year deal with an average of just under $20 million a season. Castellanos, 30, hit .309 with 34 home runs and a .939 OPS with the Reds last season, made the All-Star team and finished 12th in the NL MVP voting. Last week, former Yankee CC Sabathia cited a lack of willingness of Marlins ownership to pay up for Castellanos as a major reason why Derek Jeter abruptly resigned as CEO of the franchise. In 2020, Castellanos went viral as he hit a home run in the middle of former Reds broadcaster Thom Brennaman’s farewell apology to viewers after he had been caught by a hot mic on-air saying a gay slur. The NL East has had a very active hot stove. The Mets signed Max Scherzer, Starling Marte and Eduardo Escobar. The Braves, who are the defending World Series champion, traded with the A’s for star first baseman Matt Olson.
