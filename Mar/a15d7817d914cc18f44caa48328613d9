Bronx businesses have been terrorized by a string of robberies believed to be carried out by a gang of at least four young men, police said. Over the last two weeks, the gang has knocked off a nail salon, a barbershop and two delis — brandishing guns and grabbing cash and jewelry from their victims, cops said. The first of four incidents took place around 6:30 p.m. on March 12, when four men walked into a nail salon at 53 West 181 St. and approached a 36-year-old man sitting inside with his girlfriend.  One of the muggers pulled out a gun, and the group made off with a gold chain and Cartier glasses valued at approximately $19,500, police said. A few hours later, they hit up a barbershop at 2011 Anthony Ave. Apparently, the same group of men threatened the people inside at gunpoint and took off with cash and jewelry valued at approximately $21,800 and approximately $600 in cash, the NYPD said. A little after midnight on March 19, three unidentified men burst into a deli on the Grand Concourse, went behind the counter, brandished a weapon and stole a woman’s gold chain valued at about $3,800 before fleeing, cops said. They struck again two days later, this time at Kings Deli at 117 West Kingsbridge Road. Three thieves, brandishing weapons, took approximately $800 in cash from the register, $1,000 in CBD oils and $1,300 in electronic cigarettes. They ran from the store westbound on West Kingsbridge Road, police said. No one was injured in any of the robberies, the NYPD said.
