The Jets landed another weapon for Zach Wilson on Monday night. Tight end C.J. Uzomah agreed to a three-year, $24 million deal with the Jets, according to a source. The former Bengals tight end is coming off his best season in the NFL and gives the Jets a major upgrade at a position of need. Uzomah caught 49 passes for 493 yards and five touchdowns for Cincinnati last season, all career highs. The 29-year-old injured his MCL in the AFC Championship Game but was able to return for the Super Bowl. The Jets have not had a consistent threat at tight end since Dustin Keller left 10 years ago. Uzomah should immediately help Wilson and Mike LaFleur’s offense.
