Caitlyn Jenner has sided with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis about transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. Earlier this week, DeSantis declared Emma Weyant, the University of Virginia freshman who finished second to Thomas in the 500-yard NCAA women’s championships last week, the rightful winner. Weyant, who finished 1.75 seconds behind Thomas, grew up in Sarasota, Fla. “By allowing men to compete in women’s sports, the NCAA is destroying opportunities for women, making a mockery of its championships, and perpetuating a fraud,” DeSantis wrote on Twitter. “In Florida, we reject these lies and recognize Sarasota’s Emma Weyant as the best women’s swimmer in the 500y freestyle.” Jenner concurred. “@GovRonDeSantis agreed! She is the rightful winner!” Jenner tweeted. “It’s not transphobic or anti-trans, it’s COMMON SENSE!” Jenner, 72, won the gold medal in the men’s decathlon in the 1976 Olympics as Bruce Jenner. She transitioned from a man to a woman in 2015. For the past several months, she has been a vocal opponent of Thomas competing against women. “[Lia Thomas] is also not good for women’s sports,” Jenner told Fox News in January. “It’s unfortunate that this is happening. I don’t know why she’s doing it. She knows when she’s swimming she’s beating the competition by two laps. She was born as a biological boy. She was raised as a biological boy. Her cardiovascular system is bigger. Her respiratory system is bigger. “Her hands are bigger. She can swim faster. That’s a known. All of this is woke world that we’re living in right now is not working. I feel sorry for the other athletes that are out there, especially at Penn or anyone she’s competing against, because in the woke world you have to say, ‘Oh my gosh, this is great.’ No it’s not.”
