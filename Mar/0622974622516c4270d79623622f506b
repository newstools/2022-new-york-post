The top-seeded Providence Friars will play the Creighton Bluejays for a bid to the Big East semifinals. Providence handled Creighton with a 21-point victory in their only meeting of the season, but they find themselves as narrow favorites in this quarterfinal tilt. Gametime: 6:30pm EST TV: FS1 Live Stream: Fox Sports App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The Friars will probably find a way to advance to the Big East Tournament title game. No team in the country has been better at finishing close games, but no team in the country has been involved in so many close games. The Friars’ 21-point win over the Bluejays a few weeks ago doesn’t tell us much, occurring in Providence and on a poor shooting night from Creighton, which was first adjusting to the loss of Big East Freshman of the Year Ryan Nembhard. In its past nine wins, all but one other Providence win was decided by no more than four points and/or in overtime.
