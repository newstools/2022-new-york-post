In what could have been Coach K’s last game as Duke’s head coach, the Blue Devils unsurprisingly topped Cal State Fullerton, 78-61, in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The seventh-seeded Spartans had a tougher opening round battle as they defeated No. 10 Dayton 74-73. Mike Krzyzewski and Tom Izzo have plenty of history as their squads face off in the second round.

Improving to 13-3 lifetime against his quasi-rival should be less challenging than previous encounters, given the unusual talent gap between the teams. Michigan State, in addition to inconsistency and underwhelming performances against high-end programs (the Spartans lost to Kansas and Baylor by a total of 30 points), has turnover issues (ranked 224th in the nation). The Spartans will give too many extra possessions to potential No. 1 overall pick Paolo Banchero and Duke’s sixth-highest scoring offense in the nation. While the Blue Devils’ size and talent won’t be enough to carry them to the Final Four, it will be enough to send Krzyzewski to another Sweet 16. And after failing to cover five straight games, the Blue Devils are due for a big day.
