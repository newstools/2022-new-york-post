The cryptocurrency expert shot over his six-figure watch says he had no idea who would have targeted him. Pierrick Jamaux, 33, who was visiting the Big Apple from Hong Kong, was shot in the legs multiple times in front of his Manhattan hotel on March 18. The gunman tried to take his Richard Mille watch but wasn’t successful and fled. “I have absolutely no clue who did this. I just know why they did it for sure — to steal my watch,” Jamaux told The Post Saturday. Jamaux, who could be seen in Instagram photos wearing the watch, said he did not think he was targeted because of the social media posts. He said that maybe he had been followed. “Someone knew I had the watch and somebody knew I’d be back in the hotel at that time,” he said. “That’s up to the police to figure out who.” He was ambushed when he returned in an Uber to the Fifty Hotel and Suites at 155 East 50th St. at 4:15 a.m. with his wife and a friend. They had been at the Sapphire 39 strip club on West 39th Street. Jamaux, a native of France and a founder of an online banking platform called Hi, said he has his wife had been taking cars around town. “I never thought that there was a risk of this happening in New York,” he said. “In other countries, maybe.” Jamaux was still recovering from his wounds at Bellevue Hospital Saturday. The suspect fled in a black four-door BMW with an unknown female accomplice, according to the NYPD which said Saturday the investigation was ongoing.
