A man has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting his boss dead at work. On Thursday, the suspect was identified as Montavius Wright, 26. He was charged with murder and his bond was set at $500,000. The fatal shooting unfolded at a business on the 10th floor of Greenway Plaza in Houston just before noon on Wednesday. Officials found a male victim deceased from a gunshot wound to the head on the scene. Police immediately swept the building, and when the suspected shooter wasn’t found, a manhunt was issued. After cops learned the suspect’s identity, he was located inside his vehicle at his high-rise apartment complex. Police determined that the suspect was an employee at a Greenway Plaza business and the victim was his supervisor. Houston Police Department officials believe the suspect targeted his supervisor. Authorities reported that he “passed by everyone else.” “We do not think this was random. But that he was actually looking for his supervisor,” HPD Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite said. Satterwhite said HPD officials initially believed it was an active shooter situation because they thought the gunman was still inside the building. It’s unclear why the gunman targeted the supervisor. Officials are still trying to determine a motive after learning the suspect was not a “problem employee.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
