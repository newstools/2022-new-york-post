Lindsay Lohan’s career comeback just got even bigger. Months after it was revealed the actress is set to star in an upcoming Netflix holiday film, the streaming giant has confirmed they’ve now inked a multimovie deal with the former child star. The news was revealed Tuesday, with Netflix’s director of independent films, Christina Rogers, saying they’ve secured Lohan, 35, for an additional two feature films. “We’re so happy with our collaboration with Lindsay to date, and we’re thrilled to continue our partnership with her. We look forward to bringing more of her films to our members around the world,” Rogers told the Hollywood Reporter. Details of the two movies have not yet been made public, but they’ll reportedly be available for all 222 million Netflix subscribers when they hit the streaming service. That exposure could catapult Lohan back onto the A-list, after her dramatic personal life overshadowed her film career over the past decade. Lohan was one of America’s most famous child stars, with lead roles in “The Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls” before she suffered from drug and alcohol addictions that landed her both in prison and rehab. However, last November, the popular star became engaged to her boyfriend of two years, financier Bader Shammas, and her professional life is now blossoming right alongside her personal one. Later this year, Lohan will star alongside Chord Overstreet in the Netflix holiday film “Falling for Christmas.” An official summary of the film reads: “A newly engaged, spoiled hotel heiress (Lohan) gets into a skiing accident, suffers from total amnesia and finds herself in the care of a handsome, blue-collar lodge owner (Overstreet) and his precocious daughter in the days leading up to Christmas.” No official release date has been announced.
