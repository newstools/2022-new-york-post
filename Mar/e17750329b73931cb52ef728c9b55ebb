An unhinged Manhattan tenant is making life miserable for anyone in his building who follows pandemic mandates — even screaming at a mom that her 5-year-old’s face covering was causing “brain damage,” according to a lawsuit. Richard J. Hughes, 53, has allegedly harassed tenants at 307 East 44th St., ripped down signs throughout the 17-story building about social distancing and mask-wearing, and yelled at the building’s property manager, the landlord, Beaux Arts II LLC, claimed in a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit. The mom, who told management she was scared of the apparently erratic Hughes, encountered him in October, where he yelled at her and said she was “smothering” her daughter, Beaux-Arts said in the legal filing. In January, Hughes was videotaped ranting that requiring workers to get inoculated against COVID-19 subjected them to “death” and was “criminal.” Beaux-Arts II wants Hughes out of the building, where a one-bedroom rents for almost $5,000 a month. With an eviction potentially taking months to wend its way through a backlogged city housing court, Beaux-Arts II wants $25,000 damages along with a court order from a Manhattan judge telling Hughes to stop his bad behavior. Hughes did not return a message seeking comment.
