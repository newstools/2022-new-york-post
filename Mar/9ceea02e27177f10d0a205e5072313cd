Jackson Mahomes is ready for brother Patrick’s big wedding weekend. On Thursday, the younger brother of the Chiefs quarterback posted a photo of the pair in Hawaii, where Patrick, 26, is set to marry his longtime love, Brittany Matthews. “Best Man type vibes,” Jackson captioned the sibling snap on Instagram. Later in the day Thursday, Jackson also shared a video of himself poolside with bride-to-be Matthews. Sterling Skye, the 1-year-old daughter of Matthews and Patrick, also made a cute cameo. In addition to Jackson — who has been embroiled in some controversies in recent weeks — some of Matthews’ nearest and dearest have arrived for the upcoming nuptials, according to social media posts. Kayla Nicole, the girlfriend of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, posted a video of herself Thursday on her Instagram Story as she worked out with Matthews. Sydni Russell, who is engaged to safety Tyrann Mathieu, also posted a selfie to her Story as she lounged outside in a blue swimsuit. Both Kayla and Russell joined Matthews for her extravagant bachelorette party in Miami last month, when the group dined out together and enjoyed daytime boat trips. “The amount of shots taken & sleep not taken this weekend was well worth it. Love these girlies & so thankful for each of them!” Matthews exclaimed in an Instagram post from late February. Matthews, who is also a co-owner of the Kansas City Current soccer team, has been engaged to Mahomes since September 2020. The quarterback popped the question at Arrowhead Stadium on the same night the team received their Super Bowl rings.
