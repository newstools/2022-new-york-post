No, you aren’t seeing double. That’s just the name of this can’t miss sale from Our Place. For those already hooked on the viral cookware from Our Place, including the trailblazing Always Pan, this Seeing Double sale is for you. The Perfect Pot is now on sale with a Buy One Get One event. From today through March 14, buy one Perfect Pot and get a second one for only $95. This is a great bargain, as the non-stick pot normally retails for $165, so this deal slashes that price almost in half. These pots are rarely on sale, so this may be one of the only chances to get your hands on not just one, but two Perfect Pots to keep for yourself or gift to another fellow foodie. Since they come in seven different colors, you can even mix and match, pairing your new pots to whichever color Always Pan you have in the house, or add one of those to your cart for the whole set. The Perfect Pot really does live up to its name, coming with a Beachwood spoon, a custom roasting rack and a modular lid with a steam side for when things start to heat up. The pot has non-stick and nontoxic ceramic coating for easy cooking and cleaning, now available in seven colors while supplies last. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
