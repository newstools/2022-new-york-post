Mike White returns. The quarterback who stunned the NFL, and the Jets, with an out-of-nowhere one-game performance last season signed his restricted free agent tender, the team announced Tuesday, and will again take his place on the depth chart behind starting quarterback Zach Wilson. White, 26, burst onto the scene in Week 8 last season when he made his first career NFL start, with Wilson sidelined with a knee injury. White completed 37 of 45 passes for 405 yards and three touchdowns, leading the Jets to a stunning 34-31 upset victory over the Bengals at MetLife Stadium. White hurt his forearm in his next start. He finished the season completing 88 of 132 passes for 953 yards, five touchdowns and eight interceptions. The Jets previously re-signed veteran Joe Flacco, and there figures to be a battle for the No. 2 quarterback job behind Wilson this summer.
