Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall was wounded in Kyiv on Monday, the network said. Hall was reporting outside Ukraine’s capital when he was hurt, said Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott in a statement, adding that the network had “a minimal level of detail” about what happened. Scott said Hall is hospitalized but she had no details on his condition. “This is news that we hate to pass along to you, but it’s obviously what happens sometimes in the middle of a conflict,” Fox broadcaster John Roberts told viewers. “We’re working as hard as possible to get the best information that we possibly can. “The safety of our Fox team is of the utmost important and our highest priority.” The report comes one day after an award-winning journalist and former New York Times contributor, Brent Renaud, 51, was killed by Russian forces near Kyiv, according to the region’s head of police.

State Department spokesman Ned Price tweeted Monday, “I’m heartbroken by reports that my colleague, a State Department correspondent, was injured in Ukraine today. “Our thoughts are with him, his family, and all of his colleagues, and we wish him a full recovery. We stand ready to assist in any way we can.”
