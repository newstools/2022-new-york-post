A 12-year-old boy died of a fentanyl overdose last month after his uncle allegedly forced him to clean his home drug lab in New Jersey without wearing any gloves, prosecutors said. Troy Nokes, 35, was busted Thursday and hit with 28 charges in connection to the Feb. 1 death of his nephew, including manslaughter, employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme and endangering the welfare of a child, according to Camden County prosecutors. The 12-year-old died eight days after he was found unresponsive on his school bus in Gloucester Township, authorities said. An autopsy determined that the boy died of a fentanyl overdose. The boy’s uncle was accused of operating a “controlled dangerous substance production facility” out of his Blackwood home that he shared with his nephew. On the weekend before the child’s overdose, Nokes allegedly manufactured the potent opioid and then told the boy to clean drug paraphernalia containing fentanyl, prosecutors said. The boy was not wearing gloves, witnesses told officials. Ingesting just 0.002 grams of fentanyl results in “certain death,” according to the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics. Nokes’ co-defendant Joanna Johnson was charged with tampering with evidence and protecting the alleged killer from police.
