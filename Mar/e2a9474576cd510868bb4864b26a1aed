Thursday’s battle between No. 14 Longwood Lancers and No. 3 Tennessee Volunteers starts at 2:45 p.m. ET. The hot shooting Lancers will look to upset a talented Tennessee. Thanks to solid three-point shooting, Lancers achieved a 26-6 regular-season record. However, their work is cut out for them this weekend against Tennessee. Tennessee is led by guard Kennedy Chandler who helped them best the Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC semifinals. As a massive -2500 favorite, Tennessee will look to make a splash in the NCAA tournament. Provided by BetMGM Spread: Longwood +18.5 vs. Tennessee -18.5 Moneyline: Longwood +1200 | Tennessee -2500 Total: Over/Under 132.5 Gametime: 2:45 p.m. est TV Channel: CBS Live Stream: March Madness Live App, CBS Sports App  The Lancers don’t have the firepower to pull off the massive upset, but their strong rebounding and balanced offense — featuring the fifth-best collection of 3-point shooters in the nation (38.6 percent) — will prevent embarrassment. Coming off an SEC Tournament title run, the Vols will enter overconfident and hungover. Rick Barnes’ teams historically underperform in March — the coach has failed to cover in his past five NCAA Tournament games — and Tennessee recently struggled as a massive favorite, failing to maintain focus in a single-digit win over 6-26 Georgia.
