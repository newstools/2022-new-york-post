Add Devin Booker to the list of NBA players retaliating against hecklers. During Wednesday’s game between the Suns and Timberwolves in Minnesota, Booker was carrying the ball up the court and told a courtside heckler to “shut up, p—y.” Booker scored 28 points on the night, as he and the Suns defeated the Timberwolves, 125-116. Booker is at least the third NBA player in recent weeks to go after a heckler. Last week, also in Minneapolis, Russell Westbrook approached a fan who appeared to call him “Westbrick.” When Westbrook heard the fan taunting him during pre-game warm-ups, he quickly turned around, walked over to the fan, and asked, “What did you call me?” The heckler recanted saying, “Westbrook, Russell Westbrook. I didn’t mean it like that,” as the Lakers guard walked away. This past weekend, injured Trail Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic approached a heckler in Indiana, grabbed his phone, and tossed it. It was later reported that the heckler had told Nurkic that his mother is trash and grandmother is a b—h. Nurkic’s grandmother died of COVID-19 in 2020.
