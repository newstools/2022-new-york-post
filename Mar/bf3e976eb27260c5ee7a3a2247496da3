Aaron Rodgers has finally signed a new contract – and it’s a doozy. Rodgers has officially signed his extension with the Packers, which will lower his salary cap hit for the 2022 season and beyond – yet will still pay him a massive amount of money. The total value of the deal is reported to be $150 million over three years, according to several reports, but the structure of the deal reduces his cap hit to $28.5 million in 2022 – down from $46.7 million. Most of that is due to converting his salary to a roster bonus and adding voidable years at the end of his deal – years he is unlikely to play for the Packers. Which means Green Bay is kicking money down the line in exchange for cap savings in the short term. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported that if Rodgers retires or moves on after the 2023 season, the team will take on a $68.2 million cap hit for the 2024 season. Pelissero reported that after extending Rodgers and Preston Smith, as well as cutting Za’Darius Smith and Billy Turner, the Packers saved $45 million in cap space for the 2022 season. Green Bay still has to work out an extension for Davante Adams, whom they gave the franchise tag last week. Adams is reportedly unhappy with the idea of playing on the tag, and the two sides are “not in a great place” as they work towards a long-term deal.
