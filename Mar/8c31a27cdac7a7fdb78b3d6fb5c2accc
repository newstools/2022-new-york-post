David Bakhtiari’s lavish California wedding appeared to be the hottest ticket in town this weekend. The Packers offensive lineman, who wed fiancée Frankie Shebby at the Rosewood Miramar Beach resort, was joined by his Green Bay family for the momentous occasion. The star-studded guest list included quarterback-turned-officiant, Aaron Rodgers, and pals Miles Teller and wife Keleigh, who posted a series of photos and videos Sunday on Instagram. “Congrats to the most gorgeous bride and groom,” Keleigh captioned her post. “The most love for these 2. Can we do this every year  @davidbakhtiari @frankieshebby love you guys!! Incredible wedding weekend.” The new Mrs. Bakhtiari replied, “absolutely Down to do this every weekend.” Keleigh, who has been married to Teller, 35, since 2019, revealed that the “Whiplash” star made his way to the piano at one point during the night and played next to the groom. The Tellers have long been pals with Baktiari, 30, and Shebby, as well as Rodgers, 38, and his rumored ex-fiancée, Shailene Woodley, who also reportedly attended the nuptials. In May of last year, the group ventured to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby, where Keleigh and Woodley, 30, twinned in pink with the other ladies. Later that month, Rodgers and the “Divergent” actress traveled to Hawaii with the Tellers for vacation. Although Saturday’s wedding was a time for the Packers to let loose, this week appears to be a critical one as Rodgers will likely be making a decision about his future. The league’s reigning MVP is said to be “truly torn” on where he wants to play next, with the Broncos, Steelers, and Titans emerging as potential landing spots should he leave the Packers, per Pro Football Talk.
