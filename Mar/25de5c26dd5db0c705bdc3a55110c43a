There’s another must-see Juwan Howard video from a handshake line. Howard, Michigan’s basketball coach, wrapped his arms around sobbing Tennessee star Kennedy Chandler after the No. 11 seed Wolverines upset the No. 3 Volunteers in the second round of the NCAA Tournament Saturday to advance to the Sweet 16. It was just about a month ago that Howard went viral for punching Wisconsin assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft during the handshake line after the Wolverines were routed. A terse interaction between Howard and Wisconsin head coach Greg Garb set off the bad blood that led to the physical altercations and Howard was suspended for the final five games of the regular season. Unlike then, no one is calling for Howard to be fired now. In fact, this action was the epitome of sportsmanship. “He said to keep my head up. It’s tough for me, and he knew I wanted to get the win,” Chandler told reporters after the game. “I’ve played with his son since, like, fourth grade. So I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a great coach. I love him. He told me to keep my head up [and] ‘you played your heart out.’” Chandler didn’t address after the game whether he would enter the NBA Draft. A teammate answered the question for him and declined comment. “Kennedy is an elite player, and he’s one of the best guards in the country,” Howard said. “I got a chance to know Kennedy back when my youngest son, Jett, and Kennedy played in AAU, and they won the LeBron James tournament in Ohio. So we had a relationship back then. “Just watching his growth, I’ve always been impressed. We recruited him. Unfortunately, we weren’t that lucky, but to see the output, the effort, the growth, and being able to produce like that on the floor and how he led his team in a special way. I just gave him some words of encouragement. It shows his emotion, that he cares. As coaches, you appreciate that.”
