Kentucky deputies have arrested a 23-year-old in accused of breaking into a former lawmaker’s house, murdering his daughter in her bed and then confronting him with a rifle. The Madison County Sheriff’s Office said deputies arrested Shannon Gilday around 4:30 a.m. Monday – less than two miles from former state Rep. Wesley Morgan’s home on Willis Branch. He is accused of breaking into the home at around 4 a.m. on Feb. 22. He allegedly shot and killed Jordan Morgan, a 32-year-old lawyer, in her bed, according to Kentucky State Police. Then, according to investigators, he confronted her father, a single-term state House member who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Mitch McConnell in the GOP primary in 2020. Wesley Morgan returned fire and suffered “non-life-threatening injuries” in the shootout, according to authorities. The assailant fled in a white car. Jail records show Gilday faces charges of murder, attempted murder, burglary, criminal mischief, and assault. He was being held on a $2 million bond. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
