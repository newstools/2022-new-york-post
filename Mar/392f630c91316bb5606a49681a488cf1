A 19-year-old man survived being shot in the neck in Manhattan’s Little Italy on Monday night, police said. The teen took a single bullet to his neck outside an Italian restaurant in the vicinity of Canal and Mulberry streets at about 10:30 p.m. When cops and EMTs arrived on scene, the teen screamed at them: “Get me to the hospital,” an NYPD source told The Post. “I’ve been shot!” the teen added, according to the source. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment but was expected to survive, police said. The circumstances surrounding the shooting weren’t immediately clear. It also wasn’t known if the attack was targeted or random. No arrests have been made yet and police said they are still investigating.
