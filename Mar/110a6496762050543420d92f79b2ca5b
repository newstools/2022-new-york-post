A teen was shot in broad daylight in the rear end Friday on the grounds of a Bronx housing project, authorities said. The 18-year-old victim was blasted once in the buttocks and once in the back just after 11 a.m. at a building within NYCHA’s Mott Haven Houses on East 144th Street near Third Avenue, police said. He was taken to Lincoln Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries and is described as uncooperative, cops said. The motive for the gunfire was not immediately clear.
