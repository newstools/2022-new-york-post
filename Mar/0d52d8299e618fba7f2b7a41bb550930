Authorities are searching for two Philadelphia men who encouraged their dogs to brutally savage a cat named Buddy — shouting “Get him” and “Good boy” as the heinous attack unfolded. The evil attack was captured on a surveillance camera outside a family’s home in Frankford on Tuesday, the Pennsylvania SPCA said. The two men could be seen walking by the home with the dogs, which were on leashes, when they suddenly spotted Buddy sitting on the porch. They intentionally let go of the dogs and started cheering as the animals mauled the screeching cat, authorities said. At one point, one of the men repeatedly shouted “Get him” and “Good boy” before grabbing hold of the leashes. The dogs appeared to still have hold of Buddy as the cat’s owner rushed out of the home to intervene, the grim footage showed. Buddy sustained life-threatening injuries and was rushed to a nearby animal hospital, where he is still undergoing treatment. The two men, if found, face felony charges of animal fighting and animal cruelty that could result in up to seven years behind bars, the SPCA said.
