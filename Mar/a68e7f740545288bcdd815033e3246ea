Legendary British rocker Sir Rod Stewart took it upon himself to fill in the potholes near his home in England after he couldn’t get his Ferrari through. The “Maggie May” singer posted videos to his Instagram on Friday of him in a neon Hi-Viz safety vest shoveling asphalt out of the back of a truck into large, wet potholes. Several pals are seen working alongside Stewart in Harlow, Essex, about an hour outside the center of London. “This is the state of the roads near where I live in in Harlow and it’s been like this for ages … people are bashing their cars up,” Stewart said. He complained that the government has been putting “millions of pounds” into the nearby M11 highway while neglecting this road. “And the other day there was an ambulance for the first time, my Ferrari can’t go through here at all, so me and the boys thought we’d come out here and do it ourselves,” he said. Stewart, who released his latest album “The Tears of Hercules” last year, has scheduled a tour of the US and Canada set to kick off in June.
