An upstate New York couple was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide over the death of their 17-year-old son with cerebral palsy, a report said. Lisa and Anthony Waldron, of Oswego, were arrested in the case Wednesday – a month after a medical examiner ruled the boy’s death a homicide, Syracuse.com reported. The medical examiner said infection and malnutrition contributed to the death of the teen. The son, who died May 9, had bedsores on “a significant portion” of his body, according to the Oswego County Sheriff’s Office. As part of their investigation, police interviewed the boy’s doctors and teachers – and authorities also obtained medical and school records, the report said. The parents were also charged with endangering the welfare of an incompetent or physically disabled person. At their Wednesday arraignment, a judge ordered both parents were held on bail.
