A 38-year-old man was busted after fleeing a car stop and plowing his car through a Staten Island home early Thursday, police said. Michael Robles, 38, was driving a four-door Jeep Patriot at the corner of Hudson and Cedar streets in Stapleton Heights around 3:30 a.m. when police noticed that he had a defective brake light and stopped him. The officer also spotted a clear glass pipe with residue in the driver’s left sneaker, and asked him to get out of the car, authorities said. Instead, Robles drove off – driving a few blocks before he smashed into a home on Van Duzer Street near St. Paul’s Avenue, cops said. The impact of the crash detached the front door from the home and destroyed much of its façade, leaving loads of bricks and other debris on the ground in its wake. The FDNY said there were six minor injuries. All six refused medical attention, fire officials said. Robles had drugs in his possession, and his license was also found to be suspended, cops said. He was charged with reckless endangerment, fleeing an officer in a motor vehicle, criminal possession of a controlled substance, aggravated unlicensed operator, operating an unregistered vehicle, an equipment violation and a violation for driving without a license, police said. A full vacate order was issued for the building, according to Department of Buildings records. The FDNY also requested a structural stability inspection, the records show. “Structure rendered non-compliant,” the DOB’s records state. “Large section of brick wall collapsed onto sidewalk windows and doors damaged due to car impact.”
