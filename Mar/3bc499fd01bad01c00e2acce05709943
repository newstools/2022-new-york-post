The Falcons rebuffed trade inquiries from multiple teams about star receiver Calvin Ridley, who has since been suspended indefinitely for betting on NFL games. In the wake of Ridley’s suspension, ESPN reported Monday that Atlanta was recently approached by several teams — including the Jets, according to The Athletic – who inquired about Ridley, a former first-round pick. The Falcons “declined to enter into any talks out of good faith,” per Adam Schefter, amid the imminent fallout. Ridley, who announced in October 2021 that he’d be stepping away from football to focus on his mental health, placed bets during a five-day period in November, according to the NFL. At the time, the 27-year-old receiver was away from the team’s facility on the non-football illness list. In the wake of his suspension, Ridley — who is also said to have bet on Falcons games — tweeted: “I bet 1500 total I don’t have a gambling problem.” Commissioner Roger Goodell condemned Ridley’s actions in a letter, in which he notified the receiver of his suspension. “Your actions put the integrity of the game at risk, threatened to damage public confidence in professional football, and potentially undermined the reputations of your fellow players throughout the NFL,” Goodell stated. “For decades, gambling on NFL games has been considered among the most significant violations of league policy warranting the most substantial sanction. In your case, I acknowledge and commend you for your promptly reporting for an interview, and for admitting your actions.” Ridley can appeal the suspension within three days or he will otherwise be eligible for reinstatement next February.
