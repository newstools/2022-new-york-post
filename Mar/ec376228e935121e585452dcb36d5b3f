Would-be New York governor Jumaane Williams defends his appearances on RT America — the English-language wing of the Russian propaganda network RT — by protesting that he stopped in 2017 “because of its connections to the Russian government and its attacks on democracy, the harm of which far overshadowed any journalistic or public outreach value to the appearances.” Which doesn’t explain why he ever went on, let alone at least eight times in 2016-17. He not only went on the air to call then-President Donald Trump a “Nazi,” but also to insist that Russia and the CIA had turned the 2016 election in Trump’s favor. All this was after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and its election meddling. No need to actually apologize, Jumaane. But why not admit you were duped?
