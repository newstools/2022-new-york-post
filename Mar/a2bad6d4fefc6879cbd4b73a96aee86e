The NASCAR circuit heads to Las Vegas this weekend and Nick Giffen of The Action Network is here to give his best bets. Beginning with the driver with the best odds, Giffen has identified William Byron, who is a consensus 11-1 choice on the odds board. “Last year, [Byron] had the second-best running position at all one-and-a-half-mile ovals,” Giffen explains. Given Las Vegas Motor Speedway fits that designation, Giffen said he believes Byron’s implied probability to win should be closer to 9.4 percent. With his current odds suggesting an implied probability of eight percent, Giffen is happy to bet Byron. As for his favorite longshot, Giffen is targeting Ricky Stenhouse Jr., a driver bettors can find at around 50-1. “Las Vegas Motor Speedway is one of his best tracks,” Giffen says. “He has two top-six finishes in his last six races.” But as far as his pick to win the race, Giffen has selected Kyle Larson, who is looking to win his second race in as many weeks. “I personally am not going to bet him because his odds are right within the margin of error, but he’s definitely the driver to beat,” Giffen says.
