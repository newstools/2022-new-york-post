Did Russell Wilson have a rocky split with the Seahawks? According to The Athletic, some of Wilson’s Seattle teammates felt as though the quarterback had “checked out” last season — which was among the factors that contributed to the nine-time Pro Bowler’s trade to Denver on Tuesday. The Seahawks, meanwhile, were also reportedly unhappy with the constant headlines regarding Wilson’s issues with the team, including “leaks” by his agent, Mark Rogers. Last February, the quarterback’s camp leaked a list of four potential destinations for Wilson — which included the Cowboys, Saints, Raiders, and Bears, per ESPN — but made it clear the 33-year-old was not seeking a trade. Wilson later addressed rumors and said he did not request a trade. The Athletic also reported that Rogers privately reached out to reporters through the years to criticize Seahawks management, with an emphasis on head coach Pete Carroll. Wilson had voiced his frustrations about the Seahawks publicly in early 2021, explaining how he wanted to be more involved in the team’s decision-making. Although there are still many questions regarding Wilson’s exit from Seattle, tensions clearly reached a breaking point with both parties apparently ready to go their separate ways. Wilson was officially traded to the Broncos on Tuesday, with the Seahawks receiving two first-round picks, two seconds, and one fifth-round, as well as quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, and defensive end Shelby Harris. The quarterback took to social media the following day to thank the city of Seattle. “I Love You. Forever Grateful,” Wilson wrote, adding his Seahawks number “3.” After Wilson was traded to Denver, the Seahawks released All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wager, further signaling that the team is rebuilding.
