Police released horrifying video Sunday morning that shows a  deranged man jumping over a desk and stabbing two workers at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan a day earlier. The 60-year-old suspected of the stabbings was still on the loose as of the video’s release. The NYPD identified him as Gary Cabana. Authorities said he was angry after his membership was revoked because of two previous incidents of disorderly conduct in recent days. When he showed up to see a film at MoMA shortly on Saturday afternoon, he was denied entry and then stabbed the two workers in a rage at 4 p.m., sparking other visitors to scramble for the exits in panic. The movie “Bringing Up Baby” was set to be screened at 4:30 p.m. but cops didn’t confirm what the stabber had come to see. A 24-year-old woman was stabbed twice in the back and once in the neck, while a 24-year-old man was stabbed once in the collarbone, police said. Both victims were taken to the hospital but their injuries were considered non-life-threatening. The museum had been temporarily closed Saturday as police initially believed the attacker was still inside, but authorities later said he was caught on surveillance footage leaving the building.
