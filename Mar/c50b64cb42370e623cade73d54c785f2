Ukrainian officials are reporting initial successes in their efforts to retake territory from Russian invaders near Kyiv. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of the capital city, said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces had taken back most of Irpin, a northwestern suburb of Kyiv. Klitschko also said a battle was ongoing for the village of Liutizh, 20 miles to the north, and confirmed the retaking of Makariv, west of Kyiv, on Tuesday. The mayor spoke to reporters from a public park in the capital, over the sound of nearby gunfire. Ukrainian forces have also retaken territory northeast of Kyiv, toward Chernihiv and Sumy, NBC news reported. NBC reporter Richard Engel said he’d been briefed by two municipal officials in Kyiv. “This, they say, is the biggest counter-offensive they’ve seen since the start of the war,” Engel said. “So far, with this counter-offensive just 48 hours in, there have been significant changes around the capital.” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that the Ukrainians had launched another counter-offensive in the south, aimed at retaking Kherson — the only major city to fall to the Russians so far. Details of that operation, or its outcome, were not yet clear. With Post wires
