Pete Alonso is back behind the wheel again after the Mets first baseman was involved in a horrific car crash in Tampa on Sunday, while on his way to spring training. In exclusive photos by The Post, Alonso can be seen driving a rental SUV in Florida on Tuesday. He sported a baseball hat and sunglasses while driving solo. It’s unclear where he was headed. The 27-year-old Alonso appeared to be in good spirits at spring training on Tuesday. Other photos show the All-Star going through regular drills on the field, greeting fans and signing autographs. “[Sunday] was a real close experience to death,” Alonso said, standing in front of his locker at Clover Park on Monday. “My car flipped over probably about three times … and I am really thankful to be alive, thankful that I’m healthy.” Alonso recalled having to kick out the windshield to escape while his wife Haley, who was traveling in her own car behind him, called police. “I thought I watched my husband die in front of me and I will never forget that feeling,” Alonso’s wife wrote on Instagram, adding photos and videos showing the aftermath of the accident. Haley explained in her caption that a “distracted driver ran a red light going at an extremely fast rate and hit directly into Pete’s truck.” The crash, which left Alonso with only a scratch, occurred in Tampa, about five minutes from the couple’s home. Alonso took batting practice and fielding drills Monday and said he felt “normal.” He planned to be ready to join the rest of his team for full workouts Tuesday.
