Why have breakfast at Tiffany’s when you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner there? A sprawling penthouse in Palm Beach, Fla., situated on top of an actual Tiffany & Co. jewelry store is hitting the auction block on March 15. Currently listed for $19.5 million, the only private residence in the building has yet to be completed — with the developer hoping that any prospective buyers will design the interior to their liking. But it already holds some eye-popping amenities, which include a recently completed third-level rooftop terrace with a glass-enclosed room and an infinity-edge pool. Perched high above the iconic store at 259 Worth Ave., it is made up of five bedrooms and eight baths with almost 13,000 square feet of living space. About a year ago, it was first listed for $17.5 million. But as the pandemic raged on, it was taken off the market. Now, it has resurfaced with a much higher asking price. “We feel strongly the buyer who buys something like this is going to want to customize it to their own needs,” co-developer John C. Kean of Kean Development Co. told Palm Beach Daily News, noting that the glass-enclosed room on the rooftop terrace, originally envisioned as a bar-and-lounge area, for example, could instead become a family room. “We’ve already had offers. I’m very confident we’ll go to contract in the very near future.” Kean added that if it doesn’t sell by the summer, they will complete the interiors themselves. Pegged as a “treasure trove” and Palm Beach’s largest luxury penthouse apartment — according to the listing held by Concierge Auctions — the rooftop features views of downtown. “It sits ready for the addition of a lounge, full bar, gym, dining area, and firepit,the listing explains. “Offering an idyllic lifestyle, this one-of-a-kind penthouse is a short walk to the ocean and the legendary shops, boutiques, and restaurants that line Worth Avenue.”
