Donnie Baseball will be chronicled on the network built for baseball fans. The Post has learned that MLB Network will debut a documentary on Don Mattingly, arguably the greatest Yankee to never win a World Series with the organization, on Sunday, April 3. The film will be aptly titled “Donnie Baseball”. Speakers in the documentary will include former Yankees manager and current Mets skipper Buck Showalter, Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner, former teammates Wade Boggs, Bernie Williams, Ron Guidry and Mike Pagliarulo, broadcasters Michael Kay and Suzyn Waldman, Mattingly’s high school coach Quentin Merkel and Post baseball columnist Joel Sherman. “It’s probably very hard to think of baseball in the 1980s, especially the mid-to-late 1980s, where he isn’t the face of it,” Sherman, who was the Post’s beat writer covering the Yankees from 1989 through 1995, says in the documentary. “He’s as good a player as I’ve ever seen in my career,” Guidry says. Mattingly, who played first base for the Yankees from late 1982 through 1995 and served as the team’s captain from ’91 through ’95, was a six-time All-Star and and nine-time Gold Glove winner. He earned the 1985 AL MVP, batting .324 with 35 homers and 145 RBIs that season. The documentary is filled with nostalgic memories, from the voice of legendary Yankees P.A. announcer Bob Sheppard, to the various sights and sounds of the old Yankee Stadium in the 1980s and 90s. Mattingly gets emotional in the doc when talking about his 1995 retirement. Mattingly later returned to the Yankees as a coach in 2004 under manager Joe Torre and followed Torre to the Dodgers four years later before succeeding him as L.A.’s skipper in 2011. The Dodgers and Mattingly parted ways following the 2015 season and he was hired by the Marlins a week later. “Donnie was everything baseball should be about,” says Showalter. “There’s very few guys I would say their substance was their style. Donnie’s substance was his style.”
