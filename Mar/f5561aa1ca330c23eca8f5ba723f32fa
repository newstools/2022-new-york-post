Jay Williams has had a couple heated debates with Stephen A. Smith about Kyrie Irving, but he does not plan to hold back. Williams spoke with The Post last week on behalf of his NPR podcast “The Limits” and said that his “First Take” debates are not manufactured. Given how intense some of the segments have gotten, has this affected his relationship with Smith? “No, not at all,” Williams said. “Stephen A. is Stephen A. and I am Jay Williams. So, our relationship is solid. That’s real life, right? I don’t go into debates with things being manufactured. That’s not who I am. “It’s not like, ‘oh I’ll take this side just because you said that side.’ If I agree with something, and I get asked about a topic, and we happen to agree on it, I’m not going to change my stance on it for the sake of a debate. That’s not who I am.” Last November, Williams accused Smith of going easier on Aaron Rodgers than Irving on the athletes’ decisions not to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In January, Williams and Smith sparred again on Irving and vaccination. Williams said the story was “fluid” in the sense that narratives were shifting about how much being vaccinated protects others, and Smith accused him of being an Irving apologist. At one point, “First Take” host Molly Qerim stopped the debate, saying Williams had to be on another show. Williams accused Smith of plotting his exit, which Smith denied. “So, what people are seeing is real-life passion,” Williams told The Post. “Does that passion carry over sometimes to when we go off-air? It’s like ‘oh, okay, that was intense.’ But we also recognize that makes great TV because it was real. I think viewers deserve real s–t. They don’t deserve something manufactured.”
