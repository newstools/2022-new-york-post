It was just a tease. This game. This season. St. John’s, the thought earlier in the season, was supposed to be preparing for a big Selection Sunday. It had Villanova down 17 Thursday night. It couldn’t finish off Jay Wright’s Wildcats, like it couldn’t finish off so many big games this year. The dream of running the table here this week was ended at a raucous Garden, Villanova ripping off an 18-2 run to get back into the game and winning it 66-65 on two Brandon Slater free throws with 2.8 seconds left. It was all going so right for the Johnnies. It was 44-27. Posh Alexander hit his first 3-pointer in weeks. Julian Champagnie was dominating at both ends of the floor. Villanova couldn’t shoot straight. Then, in a flash, it all changed. St. John’s started throwing the ball away, in part due to Alexander’s foul woes keeping him on the bench. Villanova started to take advantage, catching fire from deep. When Caleb Daniels hit two free throws, after Alexander’s fourth foul with 8:11 remaining, the Wildcats had the lead for the first time since the early going. And when Jermaine Samuels completed a three-point play, the lead was four, a 21-point turnaround in the span of 10 minutes. St. John’s rallied, going ahead on Stef Smith’s three-point play with 2:08 left. It had a chance to extend a one-point lead with under a half minute left, but Champagnie failed to draw iron on a left-corner 3-pointer. On the other end, Samuels couldn’t convert, but the ball found its way into Slater’s hands and Champagnie was called for the foul, drawing boos from the non-Villanova section of the sold-out crowd.
