Buddy Boeheim, son of legendary Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim, appeared to punch a Florida State opponent during the ACC Tournament on Wednesday. Midway through the first half of Syracuse’s second-round matchup against Florida State, Boeheim and Seminoles guard Wyatt Wilkes were boxing out on a shot that ultimately went in. Boeheim then appeared to take a shot at Wilkes, who had to leave the game. “That looked intentional,” observed ESPN color commentator Jay Bilas, upon a replay. Boeheim was not called for a foul on the play, and the apparent cheap shot was not reviewed. The Orange went on to a 96-57 win and will face top-seeded Duke on Thursday at noon. “I saw the play, the kid pushed him twice, I think it was inadvertent,” the elder Boeheim said postgame. “It wasn’t much of a punch.” The 22-year-old publicly apologized after extending the courtesy to Wilkes. “In the heat of today’s game, after some shoving in the lane, I swung my arm while turning to go back up court,” Boeheim said in a statement. “It was wrong to act out in frustration. I apologized to Wyatt Wilkes multiple times in the handshake line. He said not to worry about it, but I know I was wrong. I pride myself in respecting the game and our opponent. I will not react that way again.” Boeheim, a senior guard, averaged 19.3 points per game this season for Syracuse.
