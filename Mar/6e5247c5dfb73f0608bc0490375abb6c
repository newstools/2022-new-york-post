This massive Upper East Side penthouse, which first went on the market nine years ago, just got a massive $10 million-plus price slash. The 5,100-plus-square-foot, five-bedroom co-op at 1185 Park Ave. is now asking $16.75 million — down from its $27.5 million ask in 2013. JPMorgan Chase honcho Jamie Dimon owns the neighboring penthouse. Now you can be his neighbor. Former AllianceBernstein chief investment officer Marc Mayer and his wife, Meera, an executive director at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, are the sellers, and their penthouse pad is quite palatial. The duplex comes with a library, a 700-bottle wine cellar and, most impressively, the “crowning jewel” — a 2,850-square-foot wraparound landscaped terrace. The home also features an eat-in kitchen, a garden/sunroom — reminiscent of a French orangerie, notes the listing — a woodburning fireplace with an 18th-century French mantel and 24-foot domed ceilings. A private landing leads to a central gallery with the high ceilings and a marble staircase lined with large windows showcasing city views. The building by Schwartz and Gross dates to 1929 and original details include coffered ceilings in the formal dining room — and wood paneling, pegged wood floors and decorative plaster in the library. The corner master bedroom suite has city and river views, a mahogany-paneled dressing room and walls of closets. Daniela Kunen of Douglas Elliman has the listing.
