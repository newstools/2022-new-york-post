Mike Krzyzewski was not happy with his Duke team after they suffered an ugly 94-81 loss to hated rival North Carolina on Saturday night — his final game as coach at Cameron Indoor Stadium. But he also probably wouldn’t be pleased with the lack of sportsmanship his Blue Devils assistant coaches appeared to display after the game. After Duke’s loss, video caught Blue Devils assistant coach Chris Carrawell refusing to shake hands and blowing past North Carolina coach Hubert Davis. Nolan Smith, the next Duke coach in the handshake line, shook Davis’ hand, but turned his head away from Davis while he was doing it. Coach K also wasn’t in a great mood as he returned to the court for his postgame farewell ceremony, but still gave his team some props. “I’m sorry about this afternoon,” Krzyzewski said in a brief impromptu speech to the crowd before the ceremony. “Today was unacceptable, but the season has been very acceptable. And the season isn’t over.”
