The Kremlin’s spin doctor is demanding the US return Alaska and pay Russia reparations due to the White House’s crippling sanctions imposed in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Parliament member Oleg Matveychev, who often speaks on behalf of top government officials, made the outlandish demands on Sunday while on Russian state TV, according to the Daily Mail. “We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back,” Matveychev said — even though Russia was the country that started the war. Matveychev then said he wants “the return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” That includes Alaska and even Fort Ross, California, a small area in Sonoma County that was at one point the Russian Empire’s southernmost outpost in North America and was sold off in 1841. The Doma member also said his demand includes the Antarctic. “We discovered it, so it belongs to us,” he said, according to the Daily Mail.

Matveychev continued to make wild claims Sunday, saying he wants “the return of all medals that have been unlawfully taken from our sportsmen during all Olympic games,” according to the Daily Beast. He also said the U.S. should allow Russia to extradite Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia’s anti-doping lab who admitted to doping Olympians. Western sanctions have devastated Russia, which is currently heading toward a debt default that will hurt its economy for years. The country is supposed to pay $117 million interest payment on some of its bond soon in dollars — but barely has access to US currency since sanctions barred it from Western markets.
