The chalk held in the Northeast Conference Tournament, as top seeds and the league’s two best teams — Bryant and Wagner — will square off in the final on Tuesday. Wagner really struggled down the stretch after losing star Elijah Ford. The Seahawks won just three of their final five games, including back-to-back losses, which cost them home-court advantage in this game. But since the NEC Tournament started, they’ve found their groove, winning the first two games by a combined 49 points. Bryant entered tournament play winning 13 of its last 14 games. But the Bulldogs needed a game-winning free throw by Charles Pride with 0.9 seconds on the clock to punch their ticket to the NEC finals. These two programs met in the season finale to determine who would earn the top seed in the NEC Tournament. Bryant prevailed in that matchup at home, which is why this matchup will be played in Rhode Island. Home-court advantage will be a crucial factor as the Chace Athletic Center will be rocking. This matchup will likely follow a similar pattern as the regular-season finale two weeks ago. It was a back-and-forth battle with Bryant’s playmakers making clutch shots down the stretch. The Bulldogs have the horses to make plays that Wagner does not, with Ford now out. We should see the hot outside shooting from Wagner come back to Earth. It hit 46 percent of its 3-point attempts in the first two games of the NEC Tournament despite hitting less than 30 percent from deep this season. The team has been prone to scoring droughts over the last three weeks without Ford in the lineup. The play: Bryant -3.5 (play to -4).
