The Boston Bruins are one of the NHL’s most in-form teams and one poor showing against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday night doesn’t change that. Only two teams, Colorado and Florida — the two Stanley Cup Favorites — have better records than Boston’s 27-10-3 mark since Jan. 1. The Bruins are achieving success in their trademark fashion. Over their last 40 games, the B’s rank seventh in goals allowed at 5-on-5, second in expected goals against, and second in high-danger chances allowed per 60 minutes at even strength. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: Devils +1.5 (-120) vs. Bruins -1.5 (+100) Moneyline: Devils +200 vs. Bruins -250 Total: Over 6.5 | Under 6.5 Everything is pointing up for the Bruins, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be opportunities to bet against the B’s. The New Jersey Devils are a team that bettors should keep on their radar for the rest of this season and going into 2022/23. The underlying metrics suggest that the Devils have played a lot better than their record implies. New Jersey’s 53% expected goals rate since Jan. 1 puts them 11th in the NHL and the Devs rank inside the top-5 over that span in terms of generating high-danger scoring chances. Boston’s defense will provide a stiff test for this underrated Devils attack, but the good news for value hunters is that the Bruins have confirmed Linus Ullmark — and not Jeremy Swayman — as the goaltender for Thursday night. Ullmark has been playing better of late, but his .909 save percentage and -3.0 Goals Saved Above Expected tell us that he’s been subpar despite playing behind a terrific defense this season. The Devils’ defense and goaltending are a cause for concern, but at +205 you’re only asking New Jersey to win this game about 33% of the time. I think the Devils tick that box and will be a live underdog in Boston on Thursday night. NHL prediction: Devils +205 moneyline
