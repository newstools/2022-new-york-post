Marie Antoinette would feel right at home at this oligarch’s palatial spread at the Plaza Hotel, which is quietly being shopped for $50 million, sources tell The Post exclusively. The sellers are Valery Kogan, co-owner of Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, and his wife Olga. The billionaires bought the two-unit combo as separate units — 1007 and 1009 — for $26 million around 2007 and then combined them. (They own an additional unit there that is not part of the unofficial sale.) They were last asking $45 million, when the listing — which hit just before lockdown and was pulled shortly thereafter — rather accurately described the digs as “reminiscent of French royalty.” Think lots of gold leaf detailing (on the walls, ceilings and even a TV); onyx in the bathroom and crystal chandeliers in almost every room. Details include intricate moldings, inlay floors, wood-paneled walls, and one of the Plaza’s castle-like turrets. There are also lots of built-ins, a wet bar, and a surprisingly small galley kitchen. The family also owns properties at 15 Central Park West and 515 Park Ave. that are also quietly being shopped for around $100 million, sources tell The Post. They also own a $250 million estate in Israel modeled after the White House, West Coast property, and a $20 million Greenwich, Conn., mansion — at 18 Simmons Lane — which also comes turrets and is also being quietly shopped. They had wanted to tear down the 1924 home, and rebuild bigger, but ended up renovating following reports of local opposition. Altogether they are “trying to dispose” of $250 million worth of real estate in the New York area alone.
