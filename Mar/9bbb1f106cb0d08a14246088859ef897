House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  said Tuesday he wants  a word with Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who publicly depicted  fellow GOP lawmakers as orgy-crazed party animals straight out of “House of Cards.’’ Several House Republicans sounded off to McCarthy (R-Calif.) at a closed-door conference meeting earlier in the day over claims by Cawthorn (R-NC) that some of his colleagues had invited him to orgies and snorted lines of cocaine in front of him, reports said. Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), one of the lawmakers who rose to speak at the meeting, said he was getting grilled by media members about Cawthorn’s claims of drug use and debauchery, Politico reported. Womack said many of his colleagues weren’t exactly wild, hitting the sack at 9 p.m. and still using fax machines and flip phones, the outlet said. He criticized Cawthorn — who was not at the meeting — for lumping everyone  together with his accusations of craven behavior, reports said. McCarthy promised the GOPers that he would speak to Cawthorn about his remarks, the Hill said. During a podcast interview last week, Cawthorn, 26, likened Capitol Hill to the corrupt and sexually charged environment portrayed in the Netflix series “House of Cards.” “The only thing that’s not accurate in that show is that you could never get a piece of legislation about education passed that quickly,” Cawthorn quipped. “The sexual perversion that goes on in Washington. I mean, being kind of a young guy in Washington, where the average age is probably 60 or 70 — [you] look at all these people, a lot of them that I’ve looked up to through my life, I’ve always paid attention to politics,” Cawthorn, who was elected in 2020, told the Warrior Poet Society podcast. “Then all of a sudden you get invited. ‘We’re going to have a sexual get-together at one of our homes, you should come.’ ‘What did you just ask me to come to?’ And then you realize they’re asking you to come to an orgy,” he said. Cawthorn also claimed to have seen people he described as leading national anti-addiction efforts snort coke. “You watch them do a bump of cocaine right in front of you,” he said. “And it’s like, this is wild.” Many of his colleagues found his claims hard to believe, Politico said. Some also want him to name names to try prove whether he his telling the truth, the outlet said. Cawthorn also made headlines earlier this month when  he referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “thug”  and the country’s government as “incredibly evil” to supporters, WRAL in Raleigh reported, citing video obtained of the event. Voters in North Carolina have sued to keep him off the ballot this November because of comments he made supporting the US Capitol rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, who attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
