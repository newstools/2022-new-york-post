An 18-year-old girl was repeatedly punched in the face in a random attack in an L train subway station in Manhattan early Monday, police said — in the latest violent incident in New York City’s transit system. The teen victim was walking in the 14th Street subway’s underground passageway between 6th and 7th avenues when the suspect suddenly struck her in the head at about 4 a.m., cops said. The suspect, who didn’t brandish any weapons or rob the victim during the assault, immediately fled. The teen suffered a cut to her face and was taken to the hospital for treatment, cops said. It came just hours after a 41-year-old man was stabbed in the torso on a 3 train in Harlem at about 11:30 p.m. Sunday. The victim had gotten into a fight with another male on the northbound train just moments before the stabbing, police said. The suspect fled at the 148th Street subway station, while the victim was taken to a Harlem hospital, where he remains in stable condition. Cops couldn’t immediately say if the 3 train stabbing was random — but did say the attack was unprovoked. Meanwhile, police said another 41-year-old man was robbed at knifepoint on a 6 train as he was getting off at the 96th Street station at about 2:40 a.m. Monday. The suspect had brandished a knife and ordered the victim to hand over his cash, cops said. He then fled with the victim’s property, but was arrested soon after. Cops said charges hadn’t yet been filed because the suspect was refusing to cooperate and they hadn’t been able to positively ID him.
