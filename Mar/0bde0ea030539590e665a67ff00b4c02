The best man was in the doghouse after this couple’s wedding — because he was their pet pooch. Sophia Coleman and Josh Makela, both 32, wanted their faithful hound Rocky to play a central role in their big day and deliver their rings. Dog walker Sophie even got the 13-year-old his own suit, tie and handkerchief so he looked the part. Rehearsals went well in Virginia, but on the big day, the pug and Pomeranian-mix got a little over-exited. Sophie said: “When his big moment came he was quite distracted and hoped every guest would give him a treat.” A friend of hers had to grab Rocky and guide him into place. Sophie went on: “The guests were laughing so much as Rocky finally made his way up the aisle. “He was the star of the show. I was happy for him to upstage me.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
