For these two radio stations, Christmas isn’t just a holiday — it’s a state of mind. US radio stations 92.7 FM in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and 1230 AM in Gainesville, Florida, have continually played Christmas music for the last five to six months, since the start of the holiday season in 2021, reported RadioInsight.com on Friday. Stations have been known to extend their holiday music playlist well into the New Year, but this year reportedly marks the longest holiday music stretch to date — and the second consecutive year that a radio station has celebrated Christmas into March. The radio industry news site added that 92.7 FM lost its flagship brand last fall, as Sabatino Cuppelli’s conservative talk “Nooga Radio” moved to 96.9. Meanwhile, the Gainesville station is reportedly embattled by its own ownership dispute under a buyer’s charges of racial discrimination by the seller, according to court documents. The Post reached out to the radio station owners and operators for comment on their continuous Christmas programming, though their ensuing broadcaster shuffle may be some indication. Last year, 100.9 in Richmond, Virginia, kept the holiday spirit alive through March 4, just before re-launching under a new brand as a classic hits radio station.
