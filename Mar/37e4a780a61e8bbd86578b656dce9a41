A hit-and-run driver doing donuts on a Manhattan street was captured on video slamming into a bystander who appeared to be trying to film the reckless act over the weekend, police said. The victim, a 23-year-old man, was struck by the red Infiniti Sedan just after midnight on Saturday as the driver drifted in circles for a large crowd near Vandam Street and Greenwich Street in Hudson Square, according to police. Police said the victim was critically injured — suffering a fractured skull, brain injury and severe trauma to the body. Video of the incident shared by the NYPD shows two men first walking towards the spinning car to record the spectacle from up close with their cell phones. The victim then heads towards the center to join them when he trips and falls on the ground, directly in the car’s revolving path, according to the footage. The video cuts out as the victim is pinned under the car. A final clip shows some in the crowd then raising their arms in disbelief over the horrific scene. The driver fled the scene in his vehicle eastbound on Vandam Street and was still being sought by early Monday, cops said. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment. NYPD is asking for the public’s assistance in identifying the vehicle and suspect. Anyone with information is urged to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
