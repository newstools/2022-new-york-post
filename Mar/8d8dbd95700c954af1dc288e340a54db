There are so many different ways the Jets can attack this offseason because they have so many holes on the roster. Do they go heavy in free agency and the draft to fix the worst defense in the NFL? Does the focus on offense remain building around quarterback Zach Wilson? Would they really draft a safety with the No. 4 overall pick? Should they use a first-round pick on an offensive lineman for the third straight season? These are just some of the decisions facing general manager Joe Douglas and head coach Robert Saleh in the coming weeks and months. The key to how it all works out could be how strong the bond is between those two men.
