Between launching his Feel Something Foundation (supporting the LGBTQ+ community), preparing for a world tour with Queen, working on the new “Starstruck” talent show and writing his own musical (set in 1970s New York) — singer-songwriter Adam Lambert has found time to house hunt in downtown NYC. The “American Idol” star was spotted at Lantern House — a new 22-story luxury condo complex in West Chelsea designed by Thomas Heatherwick, with two towers that link beneath the High Line. Two-bedroom units on the market (from 1,400 to 1,600 square feet) run from $3.65 million to $5.19 million, and are outfitted with bay windows, stunning water views, chef’s kitchens, wide-plank oak floors, high ceilings, walk-in closets and marble-clad bathrooms. But it’s the building’s wellness amenities that really shine. Those include a 75-foot pool, an infrared sauna, a cold plunge, a hot tub, massage and steam rooms, an Equinox-managed gym, and a yoga and meditation room overlooking the High Line. There’s also a common roof terrace, courtyard, playroom, co-working lounge, library, game room, private dining room and media lounge (should Lambert want to screen his new series for his neighbors).
