Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered yet another emotional address — this time to Israel’s Knesset — Sunday, invoking the Holocaust while accusing the country of ignoring Ukraine’s pleas for help. “Ukraine made the choice to save Jews 80 years ago, now it’s time for Israel to make its choice,” Zelensky, who is Jewish, said to a packed crowd of pols by video. “I want to remind you of the words of [revered late Israeli Prime Minister] Golda Meir that I think you recognize: ‘We want to live, and our neighbors want to see us dead. That doesn’t leave us a lot of room for compromise,’ ” he said. Zelensky condemned Israel’s current leaders such as PM Naftali Bennett, who has refused to provide Ukraine with Israel’s Iron Dome technology that would protect it from Russian missile strikes. They are showing “indifference” and “meditating without choosing a side,” he said. “You can mediate between nations but not between good and bad,” Zelensky said, according to the Times of Israel. “Everybody knows that your missile defense systems are the best … and that you can definitely help our people, save the lives of Ukrainians, of Ukrainian Jews,” he said. Zelensky also questioned why Israel has not provided more aid, even if it refuses to provide its Iron Dome technology. “We can ask why we can’t receive weapons from you, why Israel has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business. Either way, the choice is yours to make, brothers and sisters, and you must then live with your answer, the people of Israel,” he said. Zelensky also mentioned Russia’s attack on Babi Yar, a Holocaust memorial in Ukraine. He accused Russia of invoking a “Final Solution” on Ukraine, just like the Nazis did against Jews in World War II. ”Our people are now wandering the world and looking for a place the same way that you once wandered,” he said.
