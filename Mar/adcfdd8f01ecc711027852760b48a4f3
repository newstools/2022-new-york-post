Bob Saget was confusingly left out of the “in memoriam” at the 2022 Oscars on Sunday, sparking outrage from fans angry to see the snubs. Saget himself was an Oscar winner, scoring a student Academy Award in 1977 for his black-and-white documentary, “Through Adam’s Eyes.” Twitter was quick to point out the Academy’s glaring omissions in its special segment to honor those we lost in the past year. “Rioting because Bob Saget wasn’t in the In Memoriam portion of the #Oscars,” one fan pointed out. “No but seriously, why wasn’t Bob Saget in the memoriam?” added another. “Cancel the #oscars for not mentioning Bob Saget in the Memoriam,” chimed in another. The “Full House” star and comedian was found dead in a hotel room in January. He was 65. Despite the exclusions, this year’s in memoriam was particularly emotional, given the much-beloved performers who passed last year. The segment did mention the legendary actor Sidney Poitier, the first black winner of the Best Actor Oscar, who died in January at 94, breaking the hearts of many who were inspired by his successful 71-year career in classic Hollywood films “A Raisin in the Sun,” “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and “Uptown Saturday Night.” Follow the 2022 Oscars with our up-to-the-minute coverage:  “Golden Girls” star Betty White, who died at the end of 2021 just shy of her 100th birthday, was also included in the moving roundup.
