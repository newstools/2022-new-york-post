A rogue Florida cop has been fired for soliciting male prostitutes and taking graphic photos — both while on duty, according to a report. Investigators began a misconduct probe into former Palm Beach County Deputy Sheriff Joshua Brack in 2021 after a jilted ex-girlfriend claimed he routinely ran wild on the job. In a report released Monday, probers said Brack violated a raft of departmental rules and was terminated for the misconduct. Brack’s girlfriend ratted him out when she called cops to her home while several of his family members tried to retrieve his belongings after they split. She took the opportunity to recite the shocking allegations to the arriving cops  — who then alerted their bosses. Probers later found evidence that Brack trysted with male hookers while on duty and shot graphic pictures of himself while supposedly on patrol. Officials said Brack also improperly sent pictures and videos of graphic crime scenes to his former girlfriend — including one image of a man who had been decapitated in a car accident. The disgraced officer also confiscated drugs and other contraband from suspects to sell them off for personal profit, officials said. In another instance, Brack failed to respond to an emergency call because he was involved in a personal conversation with an unidentified man. The ex-cop admitted to much of the misconduct after being presented with evidence by investigators and said he regretted the behavior. At one point during the probe, Internal affairs officers surveilled Brack while he was on duty and caught him making frequent personal stops. The report found that none of Brack’s transgressions broke the law or merited criminal charges.
