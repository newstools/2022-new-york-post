Mayor Eric Adams decried as “unacceptable” the safety woes of the Big Apple’s homeless shelter system and its failure to make on-site mental health services widely available, promising to personally conduct surprise inspections at facilities. The mayor’s remarks Thursday came in response to a series of articles in The Post this week that highlighted the shoddy conditions and lack of easily accessible treatment and therapy at many facilities, with some shelter residents even telling reporters they wished they had remained on the streets. “I’m going to visit some of those sites,” Adams told reporters during a press conference after an unrelated event in the Bronx. “I’m going to do some pop-up visits. Unacceptable and we have to do better.” “I don’t want people sleeping on the side of the roads. As I drove up here, I saw people having encampments on the side of the road,” Hizzoner added. “That’s an indictment. We have to do better.” The mayor’s remarks come hours after one of the most powerful lawmakers on the City Council, Majority Leader Keith Powers (D-Manhattan), also promised additional oversight for city shelters as he condemned the conditions found by The Post. “We should never have individuals consider the streets or subway as better option than a city shelter,” Powers tweeted late Wednesday. “It’s time that we take a serious look at expanding oversight of our shelters to address the inhumane conditions inside of them.”
