An alleged drunk driver accused of killing two Pennsylvania state troopers and the pedestrian the duo were helping recently boasted to her Twitter followers she was the “best drunk driver ever.” Jayana Tanae Webb, 21, faced three counts of third degree murder after prosecutors said she mowed down troopers Branden Sisca, 29, and Martin Mack III, 33, along with pedestrian Reyes Rivera Oliveras, 28, on the shoulder of I-95 Monday night in Philadelphia, CBS 3 reported. The deadly crash unfolded as troopers were responding to a call of a person walking in the southbound lanes of the busy interstate highway near the Broad Street exit , the station said. Webb allegedly admitted to driving under the influence and reportedly cried as she was arraigned on 18 felony counts, including two counts of manslaughter of a law enforcement officer. Both of the troopers left behind wives. Mack had two children and Sisca’s widow is pregnant, according to fundraising sites. Earlier this year the suspect had taken to Twitter to brag about her alleged illegal activity. “If you ask me, I’m the best drunk driver ever,” she tweeted on Jan. 15. Webb’s feed featured other alcohol related tweets amid a steady stream of often vulgar stream-of-consciousness updates. “Why do the liquor store close so early,” she wrote on Feb. 5 along side a frowning emoji. Her account was bombarded by critical comments in the wake of the fatal crash.
