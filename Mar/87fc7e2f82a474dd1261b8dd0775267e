A 43-year-old woman is clinging to life after she was brutally beaten by a creep who tried to rape her in Harlem, police said Sunday. Video released by the NYPD shows the suspect donning latex gloves just before the 11:30 p.m. attack Friday on West 123rd Street between Lenox Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, according to police. “He was walking right behind her when you see him putting the gloves on in the video,” a police source said. “He pounced on her right after that.” The attacker repeatedly kicked the woman in the head and body – and even “curb stomped” her – while trying to rape her between two parked cars, the source said. He then fled. The victim sustained severe head trauma and was transported to NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem in critical condition. Authorities are considering the crime an attempted murder, police said. The individual is described as a male in his 40s, 5’8″, with a dark complexion and a stocky build. He was last seen wearing a dark green baseball hat, a black face mask, a white hooded sweatshirt with colorful designs and red lettering on the front, black pants, black shoes and blue rubber gloves, cops said.
