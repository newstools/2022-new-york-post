An off-duty city corrections officer smeared feces all over his Brooklyn tenant’s apartment – and then illegally evicted her less than two weeks later, cops said. The officer, Nigel Escalona, was inside the apartment where a 52-year-old woman rents out a room from him on East 83rd Street near Avenue K in Canarsie around 9:40 p.m. March 4, police said. When the tenant walked into the bedroom, Escalona ran out of the apartment, authorities said. The victim found feces smeared all over the bedroom door and door handle – as well as on the doormats, doorknob and faucets in the bathroom, cops said. Less than two weeks later, Escalona illegally evicted the woman, cops said. The victim told police she went to work on Wednesday and returned Thursday to find that the locks were changed and Escalona did not issue an eviction notice, police said. Escalona was charged with criminal mischief in connection to the feces incident and a violation of local law for the illegal eviction, cops said. Escalona started working as a Correction officer in December of 2004, according to the Department of Correction. He is assigned to the Manhattan Detention Complex in Lower Manhattan. Any discipline is pending the outcome of his arraignment.
