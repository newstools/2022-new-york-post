Iran has appreciably increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and is coming dangerously close to having enough weapons-grade material to produce a nuclear bomb, according to a report on Thursday. A confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to its members said Tehran had 33.2 kilograms (73 pounds) of 60 percent enriched material as of Feb. 19. It’s the highest level of enriched uranium ever recorded in Iran, up from the 17.7 kilograms (39 pounds) the agency recorded in early November, the Wall Street Journal reported. To produce enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel, Iran would need roughly 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of 60 percent enriched uranium, the report said. The IAEA report was released as negotiators from the US, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China meet with Iranian officials in Vienna to try to restore the 2015 deal brokered by the Obama administration. The accord lifted most sanctions against Iran in exchange for placing tight restrictions against its nuclear program, which Tehran contends is for peaceful purposes. President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal in May 2018 and slapped crippling economic sanctions on Iran. Iran claimed the US had breached provisions of the accord and began enriching uranium at a faster pace. Meanwhile, the head of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, will travel to Tehran on Saturday, according to Reuters, which cited Iranian media. In Israel, which has stood firmly against allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons, Defense Minister Benny Gantz repeated that vow as a nuclear deal appeared close. “In the coming weeks, perhaps even in the coming days, a nuclear agreement may be signed between [world] powers and Iran,” Gantz said, according to the Times of Israel. “Whether that happens or not, Israel will continue to do whatever it takes to prevent Iran from becoming an existential threat and possessing nuclear capability,” he said.
