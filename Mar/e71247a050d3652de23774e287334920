A pair of armed robbers yanked the sneakers off two teens in Prospect Park this week, cops said. The victims — an 18-year-old male and 16-year-old female who are friends — were inside the park at Fifth Street and Prospect Park West around 7:10 p.m. Sunday when the duo approached them, police said. The suspects displayed a gun before grabbing the teens’ shoes — at least one pair of which was Jordans — as well as their wallets, bags and credit cards, cops said. Then they took off, police said. Video released late Monday shows the pair inside a bodega, and then in an unspecified subway station. The victims did not report any injuries.
