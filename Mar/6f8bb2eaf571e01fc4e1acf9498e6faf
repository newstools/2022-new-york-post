A 17-year boy is clinging to life after he and a 16-year-old were stabbed during a brawl outside the Queens high school they both attend Tuesday, cops and police sources said. The older boy was stabbed in the torso and arm and the younger slashed in the leg and back around 10:30 a.m. across from John Adams High School in South Ozone Park, officials said. Both victims, who attend the school, were taken to Jamaica Hospital. The 16-year-old was expected to survive and the 17-year-old was in critical condition, cops said. The high school sent a letter to parents about the incident later in the day. “The safety and well-being of all students and staff members at John Adams High School remains our highest priority,” the letter from Principal Pedro Cubero states. “Toward that end, we are informing you about an incident that took place this morning outside in the vicinity of the school,” the letter says. “Two of our scholars were assaulted and sought shelter inside school.” The school went into lockdown and the NYPD and other officials were notified, the letter states. The order was lifted once the school was deemed safe. A third person also suffered an injury, a source with knowledge of the incident said. But details weren’t available. It’s unclear what sparked the fight, authorities said.
