When it comes to learning how to care for your baby, being a first-time parent is tough. Seasoned moms and dads have figured out first-hand which diapers leak and what crib mattress is best, but the newbies have a lot of research to do. That’s why sometimes it’s best to listen to the experts — like the pros at CES, the Consumer Electronics Show. This annual tradeshow in Las Vegas is run by the Consumer Technology Association and showcases the latest technology innovations, so it’s a great place to find some of the hottest new baby gadgets on the market. One of the most difficult (and pricey!) buys a new parent will make is a baby cam, so a CES exhibitor is a smart choice. This year one of CES’s top picks for nanny cams was the Nursery Pal Deluxe: 5″ HD Baby Monitor with Touch Screen Viewer & Portable Camera, which is currently on sale for $180.  If you’re looking for a sleek, portable baby camera, the Nursery Pal Deluxe makes a great pick. It’s an innovative Hubble product equipped with a 5″ HD color touch screen that can also be an interactive viewer as baby grows, thanks to its entertainment and educational tab packed with games, books, and videos for kids. The parent monitor lets you pan, tilt, and zoom and enjoy an impressive 1,000-foot range to keep a watchful eye, and the camera itself is easily portable with no wires thanks to a built-in battery. It also has a Hubble grip that makes it easier than ever to mount to any surface. Encrypted WiFi connectivity gives you peace of mind that your connection is protected, and a built-in privacy shield can be used to block the camera’s lens anytime. You’ll quickly see why this was the 2021 CES Innovation Award winner, and why it’s been seen in Forbes, The Bump, and Fatherly. Keep a watchful eye over your bundle of joy with the Nursery Pal Deluxe: 5″ HD Baby Monitor with Touch Screen Viewer & Portable Camera, on sale now for $180. Prices subject to change.
