The nightlife mayor is back at it. Mayor Eric Adams could be seen partying with model Cara Delevingne and hip hop artist A$AP Rocky during an event at One Vanderbilt in Manhattan on Monday night. The mayor urged New Yorkers to get their “butts back” to the city during the promotional event for a Wells Fargo credit card that lets people pay their rent with the plastic. “So everyone who moved to Florida, get your butts back to New York City because New York City is where you want to be,” Adams said from the stage. Along with A$AP Rocky, Wyclef Jean performed at the party, as Dr. Oz and Instagram celebrities mingled. In one video posted on Instagram by NewYorkNico, Delevingne stands next to Adams and hoists a champagne bottle during Rocky’s set. Other local Instagram celebrities such as the Italian America food connoisseur meals_by_cug could be seen in pictures with the mayor. Wells Fargo partnered with Bilt Rewards for the cards, which allows customers to earn perks such as points and miles when paying their rent. The move from Wells Fargo is part of a push by banks to allow the more than $500 billion in rent payments in the US to be paid with credit cards, according to Bloomberg.
