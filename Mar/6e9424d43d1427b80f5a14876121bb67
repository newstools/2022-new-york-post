After defeating the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night, the Los Angeles Lakers travel to take on the San Antonio Spurs in a game with two teams playing for a potential play-in tournament spot. What immediately stands out is that both of these teams haven’t played much defense since the All-Star break, with the Spurs ranking 27th in Defensive Rating (119.8) and the Lakers ranking 23rd (117.7) during the last two weeks. The Spurs have also been pushing the pace recently, playing the second-most possessions in the league since the break (103.3). They’re also second in offensive length of possession at 14 seconds. Nonetheless, it’s no surprise this is a team that has gone over in four out of its past six games, and we’re seeing oddsmakers open sky high totals for its games. Although the Spurs won’t be mistaken for a top-tier offense, the pace of their games means we’re likely to see high-scoring affairs. Since the break, they’ve scored 157, 129, 105, 112 and 117 with their lowest scoring outburst coming against the Memphis Grizzlies, who are eighth in Defensive Rating this season. The Lakers are far from the Grizzlies defensively. The Lakers have gone over the total in their last two games, and a big part of that is their lineups with LeBron James at center. In Saturday night’s 124-116 win against the Warriors, James scored 56 points, and the Lakers as a whole made 18-of-41 3s and scored 1.2 points per possession. I believe the Lakers have found a gear offensively, which they can use throughout the rest of the season. However, with James at center, we aren’t likely to see a ton of rim protection. The Lakers are just 22nd in opponent field goal percentage at the rim (66.2 percent) and struggle in both half-court and transition defense. In three Spurs-Lakers games this season we got scores of 121-125, 106-114 and 138-110. The outlier — a 220-point performance — came in a game with just 96 possessions and James in the lineup. The other two matchups we saw games with possessions of 103 and 105. Overall, I’m expecting a fast-paced game between two teams that struggle to defend. With my model making this game 238 and oddsmakers opening this total at 234, I’ll play the over in this spot. The play: Over 232.5
