Bennedict Mathurin, an Arizona guard who appeared to tap a TCU cheerleader on the chest in a viral video from Sunday’s March Madness game, said he has reached out to her and attempted to apologize. “I actually sent an email trying to reach out to the cheerleader,” Mathurin told reporters on Wednesday. “Through the TCU athletic department, I reached out to her and that is it.” Before Mathurin’s comments, Arizona athletic director Dave Heeke had issued a statement saying that Mathurin did not recall touching the cheerleader. “Shortly after returning to Tucson, I was notified that people on social media were claiming a video clip showed Bennedict Mathurin may have made physical contact with a TCU student while walking off the court. I have reached out to TCU’s Athletics Department and I spoke with Bennedict,” Heeke said, according to ESPN. “While he does not recall any contact, he has attempted to reach out to the TCU student through their athletic department to apologize.” TCU has not made any public comment on the matter. In the video, Mathurin bowed toward the crowd and entered the Arizona locker room with his arms spread wide. In the midst of that, he appeared to touch the TCU cheerleader’s chest, though his head was turned away, and she had no immediate reaction. Mathurin, a sophomore, scored 30 points in Arizona’s win over TCU on Sunday.
