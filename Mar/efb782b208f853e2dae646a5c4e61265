NCAA tournament stalwart, Tom Izzo, will take on the Davidson Wildcats for this 7 vs. 10 matchup. BetMGM Sportsbook has the Spartans as very slight underdogs ahead of tonight’s game. Despite limping into the tournament, the Spartan’s legendary defense could be expected to carry them past the first round. However, while Izzo looks to right the ship, they will have to stop the hot three-point shooting from this Davidson Wildcats team. Predictions, odds, and how to watch below…  Gametime: 9:40 p.m. est. TV: CBS Live Stream: CBS Sports App, March Madness Live app Provided by BetMGM Spread: Davidson +1.5  vs. Michigan State -1.5 Moneyline: Davidson -105 | Michigan State -115 Total: Over/Under 140.5 The Spartans closed the season with four wins in 11 games, half of them coming against Maryland’s worst team in 25 years, and don’t have the top-end talent — no player averages more than 12 points per game — to carry Tom Izzo to another tournament win. Michigan State’s edge in athleticism and in transition will be erased by Davidson’s unbelievably slow pace (ranking 305th in the nation), 9.8 turnovers per game (11th fewest in the nation) and 38.5 percent 3-point shooting (ranking sixth in the nation). After three years at Michigan State, Foster Loyer is now Davidson’s leading scorer, hitting 44.5 percent from deep.
