The way you see a woman’s face in this optical illusion claims to reveal an insight into your personality. Viewers should be able to see an in-profile or a face-to-face shot of the woman, or maybe even both. If you see the woman from the side, it means that you’re caring, according to the test. You will face every challenge with rationality and you don’t tend to get carried away with your emotions. You are an optimist as you always see the glass half full, rather than half-empty, according to Insta News. And, the test claims that you would always help a friend in need. The illusion appears to show the woman looking toward a camera. Those who see a face-to-face shot like to be direct with their peers. You try to remove tension from any situation and are someone who tries to meet goals no matter how difficult they may be to achieve. Americans that see a side-on view also try to live their life without fear. But, the test claims that a person’s stubbornness can often help them succeed. Meanwhile, a trippy optical illusion has left viewers’ heads spinning. In a video, uploaded to Reddit, layers of black and white circles made up of tiny blocks spin in different directions at the same time. It gives a hallucinatory effect of circles growing towards you while others fade away. If you focus on the inner middle circle where letters flash up before looking at your hands, you’re set to be in line for a trippy surprise. It appears as though your hand is both moving and melting at the same time. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
