It’s times like these we give respect to one of rock music’s heroes. The late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins will be honored during the 2022 Grammy Awards broadcast on Sunday, April 3. He and the rest of the band were previously slated to perform at the event before his unexpected death last Friday. “We will honor his memory in some way,” Jack Sussman, CBS’ executive vice president of specials, music, and live events, confirmed in a statement to Variety. “We want to figure out what is the right thing to do that is respectful to everyone involved. We’re patient. We’ll be planning right up until the very end.” On Tuesday, the band announced the cancellation of all standing concert dates worldwide — including, presumably, their previously scheduled Grammys performance. However, there was no official word on whether Hawkins’ bandmates themselves would take part in the weekend tribute. “We’re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won’t be seeing one another as planned,” the band said in a statement. “Instead, let’s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we’ve made together.” News of the Foo Fighters’ slot during “Music’s Biggest Night” came just days before Colombian newspapers reported the untimely passing of Hawkins, 50, who was scheduled to play with the band at a festival in Bogota on March 27 before he was found dead in his hotel room.
