Greg Bird is back in the AL East — or at least has a chance to work his way there. The former Yankees top prospect signed a minor league deal with the Blue Jays, MLB.com reported Thursday. Bird, 29, spent last season with the Rockies’ Triple-A affiliate, batting .267 with 27 home runs and a .894 OPS in 112 games. The first baseman last played in the major leagues in 2019 with the Yankees, but they designated him for assignment after the season following a once-promising tenure that was derailed by injuries. As a rookie for the Yankees in 2015, Bird hit .261 with a 135 OPS-plus. But he missed all of 2016 after undergoing shoulder surgery for a torn labrum. He went on to have ankle and foot injuries in the following years, limiting him to just 140 games from 2016-19. Since leaving the Bronx, Bird signed minor league deals with the Rangers and Phillies before landing in the Rockies’ organization last season.
