San Diego Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. suffered a fractured left wrist in the offseason and will miss the start of the 2022 season. Padres general manager A.J. Preller told reporters on Monday that surgery is a “distinct possibility” and that the All-Star shortstop could miss up to three months. Preller said Tatis fractured the caphoid bone in his left wrist early in the offseason and that the injury flared back up when Tatis began to swing a few weeks ago. The injury news came after the 23-year-old signed a massive 14-year contract extension with San Diego worth $340 million before the start of the year. Tatis has dealt with back and shoulder injuries in his career. According to The San Diego Union-Tribune, Tatis was involved in a motorcycle accident last December. It’s unclear if the incident is related to his wrist injury. Tatis led the National League in home runs (42) last season, while finishing with a .364 on-base percentage and a .611 slugging percentage.
