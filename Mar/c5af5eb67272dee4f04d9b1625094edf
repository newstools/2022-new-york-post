The Indiana Hoosiers took care of business vs. the Wyoming Cowboys in the First Four, forcing 18 turnovers. This was the key and the major difference in their eight-point win. However, they now go up against the Saint Mary’s Gaels, one of the only programs this season to take down the top-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs. Both the Gaels and Hoosiers thrive on the defensive end, but the Gaels rank ninth in adjusted defensive efficiency, per KenPom, versus Indiana’s 21st. Saint Mary’s also has a stronger offense and can hit shots both inside and out, while Indiana lives in the paint and at the free-throw line. Do not expect the Gaels to give the ball away too often, as they are a disciplined squad that will be much more poised for the moment than the Cowboys were Tuesday night. They should cover the short number as the favorite. Saint Mary’s also has the inside presence of Matthias Tass to counteract Trayce Jackson-Davis and Race Thompson. On top of that, the Gaels have stronger, more-experienced guard play. As long as Saint Mary’s takes care of the ball and can limit the impact from Jackson-Davis on this game, Indiana could look lost, especially if Jackson-Davis can’t get to the free-throw line.  Look for the Gaels to limit second shots when the Hoosiers have the ball. Once that happens, they should control the pace of play for much of the game. Since Indiana is not a very sound offensive squad, the Hoosiers will not dictate how this matchup is played. The play: Saint Mary’s. -2.5.
