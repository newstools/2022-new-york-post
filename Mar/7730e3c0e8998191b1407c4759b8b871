Human bones were found on the side of the Hutchinson Parkway in The Bronx Friday afternoon, police said. A construction crew made the grisly discovery at around 12:30 p.m. in a wooded area near the northbound Orchard Beach/City Island exit, the NYPD said. Multiple officers were looking for evidence at the site of the gruesome find Friday night, according to footage shot by News 12. The possible crime scene had been cordoned off with a blue tarp and was illuminated by flood lights, the footage showed. The remains have been sent to the medical examiner for evaluation, according to police.
