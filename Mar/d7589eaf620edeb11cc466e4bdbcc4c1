At least 10 people were wounded in a shooting outside of a Dallas party venue early Saturday night, including an 18-year-old man who was hospitalized in critical condition, police said. The gunfire erupted just before midnight at The Space, an event venue in South Dallas, after multiple people were turned away by security when they tried to enter with firearms, according to a report and police. Joe Morgan, who was working crowd control for a spring break party at the venue, told WFAA that the suspects grew irate when security searched them and tried to confiscate their weapons. “They just got in their car and started shooting,” said Morgan. When the shooting began, all of the people waiting in line “started running through the gate and trampled us,” he said. First responders found multiple gunshot victims upon arrival, including an 18-year-old man who was transported to a local hospital in critical condition, cops said. Over the next several hours, nine other victims checked into various hospitals across the city in stable condition. The youngest victim is 14-years-old, the report said. No arrests have been made and police have not released information about any suspects.
