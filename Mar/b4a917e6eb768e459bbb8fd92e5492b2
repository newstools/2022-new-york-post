The Knicks realize they may have to plan for life without starting center Mitchell Robinson, the longest-tenured current Knick. The free-agent options at center are plentiful — some cheap, some pricey; some young, some old. On Feb. 13, The Post reported Robinson and the Knicks weren’t on solid ground regarding a new contract and he likely will hit the road if he reaches unrestricted free agency without an extension. ESPN subsequently confirmed Sunday that talks haven’t gotten anywhere close.
