Two women killed when a man lost control of his vehicle on the FDR Drive and slammed into a concrete barrier in Manhattan have been identified. Cops said they found the victims — Kesha Montez, 35, of Yonkers and Mahogany Robinson, 29, of Columbus, Ohio — dead in the back of the unidentified driver’s white 2006 Infiniti M35, which was  “engulfed in flames” when first responders arrived on the scene around 4:30 a.m. Friday near East 72nd Street. The suspect, Daquan Allen, 33, was in “serious but stable condition,” at Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he was also in police custody, NYPD said. He is in custody, with charges pending, on suspicion of drunk driving, cops said.
