JetBlue announced on Monday that the airline will add 5,000 new jobs in the Big Apple – which Mayor Eric Adams billed as one of the elements necessary in order to reboot the city’s tourism industry as it continues its pandemic recovery. “You are the ambassadors for New York City to help our economic recovery. We have a tourism industry that…$72 billion dollars comes from – 400,000 people are employed in that industry,” said Adams during a JetBlue hiring event at John F. Kennedy International Airport. “If we get it wrong, if someone fails to have a good interaction with you at a JetBlue counter or on the plane. Then people don’t want to come back to our city.” Adams has vowed to bring back Gotham’s economy, recently rolling out a COVID recovery plan aimed at building back businesses and attracting tourists to visit the city. “This is not merely a moment of being employed, this is a moment of finally getting our economy back into flight, so we can turn around our city and show the country how resilient we are,” he added. The airline plans to make the hires for a wide range of roles – in-flight crewmembers, ground operations, and information technology – all within 2022. Headquartered in Long Island City, the airline already employs 8,000 in the city. Robin Hayes, JetBlue’s CEO, said the move comes as the airline plans to ramp up its daily flight schedule this summer – from 200 to 300 flights per day. It’s also another positive development from the Big Apple’s hometown airport, as The Post reported last year JetBlue expanded jobs after flirting with the idea of moving the bulk of its operation down to Florida.
