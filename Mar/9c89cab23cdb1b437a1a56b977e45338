JuJu Smith-Schuster is taking his talents to Kansas City, and his mother is making it clear to Steelers fans that this was the franchise’s choice, not her son’s. Sammy Schuster, the mother of the wide receiver, posted on her Instagram Story over the weekend that she’s lost a bunch of followers, and claimed that Pittsburgh did not want to put forth the effort to save the proverbial marriage. “As expected I’ve lost 400k followers,” she wrote. “It’s all good. I will say this … like all marriage, relationships, friendships … there is always one person who fights to keep that love alive … In our case … We JuJu & I fought to stay in Pittsburgh because it was never about money it was about loyalty.” “But I guess Steelers had a new boyfriend in mind [laughing emoji]. So they didn’t want JuJu anymore. FYI Pittsburgh!! We fought to stay!!! If your [sic] not wanted then why? Stay!!! Thank you to the loyal family (fans) who are still following me!!! Steeler Nations!!!!” Smith-Schuster, 25, had his season cut short after just five games last year when he underwent surgery to repair a dislocated shoulder. Off the field, Jackson Mahomes, the brother of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, is excited that the receiver wound up in Kansas City, hoping that the two social media stars can collaborate on TikTok at some point. One suspects that will ultimately happen.
