Kid Rock discussed his recent album “Bad Reputation,” and revealed why he hasn’t been canceled Monday on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “So if there was a message behind the album, what would it be?,” Tucker Carlson asked. Kid Rock responded, “To my fans, I love you dearly. To [the] critics, haters and trolls – go f— yourself.” “I love the trolls and the haters and the critics who’ve been trying to, you know, knock me down for 20, 30 years. And I just, I’m still standing, [and] still operate at the highest levels.” Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, has come under fire by critics for things he has said, and beliefs he holds. “So why haven’t you been canceled?,” Carlson asked. “I’m uncancelable,” Kid Rock said. “Because I don’t give a f—.” “I’m not in bed with any big corporate things. At the end of the day, there’s nobody I’m beholden to. No record companies, no corporate interests, no nothing. And you can’t cancel me. I love it when they try.” Carlson asked why more artists aren’t like Kid Rock. “Because they’re in bed with record companies and, you know, corporate deals and instructors at every level,” he said. “I think I crawled out of the womb with both middle fingers in the air.”
