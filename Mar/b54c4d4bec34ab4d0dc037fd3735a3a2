A wild sucker-punch was thrown during a high school track race in Florida over the weekend. The punch occurred at the Tohopekaliga Tiger Invitational in Kissimmee on Saturday. According to Canadian Running Magazine, the incident happened during a 1,600-meter race. TMZ cites witnesses as saying that the athlete who threw the punch was not involved in the race. He was reportedly standing on the track, and the runner in first place — who ultimately got punched — told him to move out of the way. During the next lap, instead of moving, the athlete reportedly further impeded the first-place runner, who pushed him over. In apparent retaliation, the athlete in the black chased him down and socked him in the head. It was not immediately known if any criminal complaints were made over the incident. Running Magazine reported that police were called over the incident, but it was not immediately known if any charges were filed.
