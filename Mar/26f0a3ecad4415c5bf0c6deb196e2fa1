Kelly Stafford seems to be feeling a bit nostalgic following a wild week of blockbuster quarterback trades. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Matthew Stafford’s other half quipped about the current happenings in the NFL — with Russell Wilson and Carson Wentz now officially on the move — writing, “Everyone getting traded and we’re just over here like…,” as she shared images of the Rams’ Super Bowl-winning quarterback lounging on the couch with the couple’s four daughters. The “Morning After” podcast host also added the hashtags, “been there done that,” and “offseason duties.” Kelly’s clearly referencing last year’s stunning trade that sent Stafford to the Rams after 12 seasons with the Lions. Detroit received LA quarterback Jared Goff, two first-round picks, and a third-round selection as a result. Kelly, who has been married to Stafford since 2015, previously opened up about the culture shock of relocating to LA after spending over a decade in Detroit. “Random tears come very often when I think about not being here,” Kelly shared in a January 2021 Instagram post. The trade ultimately worked out, however, as Stafford led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl 2022 last month, earning the first championship title of his career. While the Staffords now appear to be enjoying a quiet offseason, some of the quarterback’s peers have experienced an eventful 48 hours. Wilson was traded to the Broncos from the Seahawks on Tuesday, while Wentz landed in Washington on Wednesday after a one-season stint in Indianapolis.
