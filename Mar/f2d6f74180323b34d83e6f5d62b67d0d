An Oklahoma woman has recalled the horrifying moment she learned her dad had bedded her best friend. Autumn Ankerich, 21, shared the shocking story in a TikTok video that has racked up more than 1.7 million views since it was posted earlier this month. “Thinking about the time on vacation I found a condom wrapper in my dad’s truck from the night before but he was only with me and ‘bff,'” the disturbed daughter captioned the clip. In a subsequent interview with Jam Press, Ankerich detailed how she confronted her gal pal after finding the incriminating item inside the vehicle. “I asked her why there was a condom wrapper on the seat and she told me she thought it was a dream,” Ankerich stated. The frisky friend initially refused to admit she had bedded her bestie’s dad, saying they “just made out.” However, after further interrogation, the pal eventually admitted to the steamy sex session — prompting the end of their longtime friendship. According to Ankerich, the backstabbing bestie brazenly bragged about the X-rated romp on social media. “She posted [about it] on Instagram a few weeks later,” she told Jam Press. Ankerich and her former friend haven’t seen each other since. Despite Ankerich’s initial shock, she says that, in retrospect, both her dad and her best friend were acting suspiciously on the night of their truck tryst. “My friend was flirting with my dad and he was flirting back, so I went to the room as it made me uncomfortable,” she stated. “I used to be a ‘daddy’s girl’ but as I got older and smarter, we grew apart because I realized he wasn’t normal.” The best friend was over the legal age of consent, and Ankerich does not accuse her father of any criminal wrongdoing. Meanwhile, the story stunned TikTokers, many of whom responded with quippy comments beneath Ankerich’s video. “So she was calling him daddy too?” one viewer joked. “I mean at least he used protection,” another wisecracked.
