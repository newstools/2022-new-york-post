Baker Mayfield still isn’t the most sought-after quarterback on the market – but there seems to be some interest materializing. Mayfield has been expected to be dealt out of Cleveland after the Browns traded for controversial star quarterback Deshaun Watson. Mayfield’s camp has been in preliminary discussions with the Seahawks, according to The Athletic. The report also mentioned that the quarterback was in talks with the Panthers, though that idea was refuted by a local reporter Tuesday. However, the Seahawks are likely looking for a quarterback after they pulled off a huge trade of their own, sending Russell Wilson to the Broncos for a trove of draft picks. Browns insider Mary Cay Cabot has reiterated that a few teams have reached out to Cleveland to inquire about the quarterback, who struggled through injuries and poor play in the 2021 season. Sports Illustrated reported that the team is asking for a first-round pick, which may be too high of a price. In a potential worst-case scenario, Cabot also reported that the Browns may be forced to cut their former No. 1 overall pick – and if they do, the division-rival Steelers would be ready to “pounce.” Pittsburgh recently signed another underwhelming top-pick quarterback in Mitchell Trubisky, but only committed to him for two years and could still be looking to add another signal-caller. After a strong rookie year and a third season, in which Mayfield led the Browns to their first playoff win in over two decades, the wheels fell off in 2021, when he suffered a torn labrum in his shoulder and threw for only 3,010 yards with 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. After the Browns made their intentions to trade for Watson known, Mayfield requested a trade, with the Colts as his preferred destination. The Colts then traded for Matt Ryan, leaving Mayfield in the wind. We will see where he ends up as the offseason rolls on.
