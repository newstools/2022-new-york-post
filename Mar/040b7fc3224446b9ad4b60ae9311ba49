A hater hurled homophobic slurs and threats at a former Howard Stern show regular who was jogging in Manhattan last month, hissing “Kill the f—-t” and throwing a white substance on his head, police said Thursday. “Elegant” Elliot Keith Offen, who often talked on the radio program about jogging around the city in women’s clothing, was targeted at around 8:25 p.m. Feb. 21 at 77th Street and Second Avenue on the Upper East Side, cops said. As the unidentified men approached Offen and hurled the slur, one also said “Get the gun out,” police said. One of the men then threw an unknown white liquid substance onto the back of Offen’s head. It wasn’t clear if the men were aware of Offen’s identity. Offen was a regular bombastic character on the Howard Stern show from 2000 to 2006. He was banned from the Sirius building after a dust-up with Stern in 2016, according to reports. Offen was also attacked in a hate crime outside a Brooklyn synagogue in 2014. It’s still underdetermined what the white substance was, cops said.  Offen could not immediately be reached for comment. The Hate Crime Task Force is investigating.
