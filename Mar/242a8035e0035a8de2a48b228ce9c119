Eleven people were hurt – including a 3-year-old girl – when a blaze erupted in a Brooklyn apartment early Thursday morning, according to police and fire officials. Firefighters responded around 1:45 a.m. to the Williamsburg building on Moore Street near Manhattan Avenue, where the flames broke out on the third floor, the FDNY said. Video posted to Citizen shows what appears to be locals setting up a ladder on the street – moments before several pops rang out and a huge fireball erupted. A total of nine civilians and two firefighters were hurt, according to the FDNY. Five of the civilians were hospitalized, including the toddler, who suffered smoke inhalation and was taken to Woodhull Medical Center in critical but stable condition, cops said. Three women – 45, 47 and 57 years old – and a 43-year-old man went to the same hospital, all in stable condition, police said. The firefighters, who sustained minor injuries, were also hospitalized, officials said. Nine people were displaced as a result of the fire — which may have been sparked by a space heater, cops said. The blaze was placed under control just before 3 a.m., according to the FDNY.
