Dramatic drone video released by the Ukrainian military captured the moment a Russian tank was blown to smithereens in Mariupol — as a crewman jumped from the 40-ton vehicle and ran for his life. The footage shows the “Z”-emblazoned tank rolling along a deserted street in the besieged city before it comes under fire by the Azov Battalion’s artillery. One crew member is seen clambering out of the turret and running away as smoke spews from the smoldering wreck of the disabled vehicle, which was hit multiple times. The soldier appears to have been wounded and ends up writhing on the ground nearby as a dead comrade lies a short distance away. It was not immediately clear how many Russian crewmen were killed in the strike. Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage. Kyiv has claimed Ukrainian forces have killed or captured 13,000 Russian soldiers so far, and destroyed nearly 200 planes, 400 tanks and 2,000 other vehicles.
