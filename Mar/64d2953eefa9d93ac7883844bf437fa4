A 15-year-old boy was shot in the back and torso inside a playground at 89th Street and Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights, Queens, police said. The teen was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital Center in stable condition, an NYPD spokesman said. A police source said the teen “was not an innocent bystander.” “He got into a fight and he got shot for it,” the source said. Two older men in their early 20s, one of whom was wearing a black T-shirt and blue jeans, were believed to have shot the teen, sources said. The sources noted a recent uptick in shootings in the neighborhood, including two people struck at 82nd Street and Northern Boulevard early Saturday and another incident last week at 90th Street and 34th Avenue. The young victim in the playground shooting is expected to survive, cops said.
