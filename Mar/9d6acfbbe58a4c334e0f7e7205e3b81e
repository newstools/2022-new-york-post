Duke has performed much better in the March Madness 2022 tournament than many thought they would, considering the way they limped into the tourney. Still, when you have the greatest head coach in college basketball history, you always have a shot. Duke will square off with a Texas Tech team that has torched its competition thus far, and it could be the game that proves to be Coach K’s last. Gametime: 9:39 p.m. EST TV: CBS Live Stream: CBS Sports App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: Duke +1.5 vs. Texas Tech -1.5 Moneyline: Duke -110 vs. Texas Tech -110 Total: Over 137.5 | Under 137.5  The man with the most wins in NCAA Tournament history will likely see his career end against a coach who is leading a team in the Big Dance for the first time. Mike Krzyzewski has one of the most talented teams in the country, but the inexperienced group is ill-prepared for the physicality and frustration awaiting them in a matchup with the nation’s top-ranked defense. Though the experienced group of Texas Tech will be facing a top-10 offense for the seventh time this season — the Red Raiders swept Baylor, beat Kansas, then later took the Jayhawks to double-overtime — the Blue Devils spent conference play without once facing a top-40 defense. Duke has spent much of the season pointing to its potential, but time has run out for a team whose toughness remains in question and will likely struggle against the slow-paced grind of each possession against Texas Tech’s defense.
