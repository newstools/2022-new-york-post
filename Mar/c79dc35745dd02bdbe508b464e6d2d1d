Happy player, happy agent. Russell Wilson and his agent Mark Rodgers are all smiles in the first photo showing the quarterback after he was traded to the Broncos on Tuesday. ESPN’s Mike Tannenbaum tweeted the snap, which captured Wilson with his arm around Rodgers while the two stood outside a private plane. Wilson addressed the blockbuster trade Wednesday in a tweet, writing: “SEATTLE, I Love You. Forever Grateful. #3.” The nine-time Pro Bowler will now compete in a stacked AFC West that includes quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, and Derek Carr. The Broncos were reportedly one of Wilson’s desired trade destinations — and that smile says it all. According to ESPN, the Broncos agreed to trade quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022, No. 9 overall and 2023), two second-round picks (2022, No. 40 overall and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round pick for Wilson and Seattle’s 2022 fourth-round pick. Wilson signed his no-trade clause and passed his Broncos’ physical, ESPN reported.  There are pending physicals for the other players involved in the trade, which cannot become official until the new league year begins March 16. It’s unclear if Wilson asked for a trade. However, some fans weren’t shocked to see him leave Seattle after he aired his frustrations about the team last February.
