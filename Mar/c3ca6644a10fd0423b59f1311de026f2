The Post’s Brian Costello, Paul Schwartz and Ryan Dunleavy all spent last week at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis reporting on what players have caught the attention of the Giants and Jets, both of whom have multiple top-10 picks in this year’s draft. Let’s recap what was learned through the text messages The Post’s experts sent to Sports+ members on the Inside the NFL Draft thread. If you’re not already signed up to get the latest draft rumblings sent straight to your phone, you can do so here. Tuesday, March 1 • The feeling I got today talking with GMs and coaches at the Combine is that not everyone is buying into the idea that no QB will be drafted in the top 10 picks this year. That’s only happened once since 2001, and this is just the beginning of “falling-in-love season” for draft prospects, as one source put it. For the Giants and Jets, teams falling in love with these QBs means creating a trade market for 4 picks in the top 10, especially the Jets’ No. 4 and Giants’ No. 5 if the Panthers are going to go QB hunting at No. 6.— Ryan Dunleavy
