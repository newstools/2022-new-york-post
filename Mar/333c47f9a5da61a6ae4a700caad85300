Coca-Cola on Tuesday said it will suspend business in Russia, joining a list of companies that are giving in to consumer pressure over the war in Ukraine. It joins a list of companies that have filed out of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier Tuesday, McDonald’s announced that it will temporarily shut its 850 restaurants in Russia after it came under intense pressure on social media to cease doing business in the country.

In a letter to employees, McDonald’s president and CEO Chris Kempckinski praised the company’s workers in Russia, saying they have “poured their heart and soul into our McDonald’s brand.” “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,” Kempczinski said.
