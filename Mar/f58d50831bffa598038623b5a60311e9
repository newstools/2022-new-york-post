The NYPD released a clear picture Friday of the suspect in the horrific attack on an 87-year-old woman in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood last week. The unnamed attacker shoved the elderly woman from behind at West 28th Street and 8th Avenue around 8 p.m. on March 10, seeing her to the ground where she smacked her head, cops said. The victim, identified online by family and friends as Barbara Maier Gustern, was in critical condition before she died Tuesday. Services will be held Gustern, a beloved singing coach, on Saturday, according to her Facebook page.
