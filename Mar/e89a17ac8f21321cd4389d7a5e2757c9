A man found a dead body underneath his girlfriend’s home while doing some plumbing work. Tracey Douds, of Pennsylvania, thought a dead animal was causing the foul smell as she could never have imagined it was a rotting corpse. She told KDKA that her boyfriend was fixing the plumbing of her mobile home on Thursday when he came across the skeletal remains. Recalling the ordeal, Douds said: “He came out and he’s like, ‘Tracey, you’re not going to believe this.’ “I’m like what. He’s like, ‘I think there is a dead body under there.” At first, Douds thought her partner was joking until they unearthed the bones. The police were called and cops said the human remains were in an “extreme state” of decomposition, WPXI reports. The manner of the death hasn’t been determined, according to a state police report. Cops are trying to work out how long the body has been under the Ohioville home. They do not know when the person died and are unsure about the body’s gender. Douds admitted that she has been left traumatized by the ordeal. She said: “We’re a little traumatized. But it will be over with soon.” She has lived at the property for around five years with her daughter. Douds said sleeping at the property has been “weird” since the remains were discovered. She said: “I am no Nancy Drew but I’ve been freaked out for a long time.” Pennsylvania state police are continuing to investigate as the probe remains ongoing.
