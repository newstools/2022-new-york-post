Here are three potential targets for the Jets in free agency: The 30-year-old knows Mike LaFleur’s system after playing the past five years for the 49ers. The Jets have a hole at right guard Tomlinson could fill. Davis has six interceptions in the past three years and is just 25 years old. He comes from a winning program in Tampa Bay and would help an inexperienced group of cornerbacks. Another Buccaneer, Howard has not lived up to they hype around him coming out of Alabama, but he is just 27 and the tight end market was weakened by how many potential free agents received the franchise tag. Howard may be an affordable option for Douglas at a position that desperately needs an upgrade.
