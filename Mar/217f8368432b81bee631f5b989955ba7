Eight games fill out Wednesday’s NBA card, but Joe Dellera of The Action Network is focusing on one matchup for his best bets (video above). That matchup? A showdown in Philadelphia between the Knicks and 76ers. Rather than choosing a side for Wednesday’s tilt, Dellera’s first wager is on the total: over 222 points. “Over the [Knicks’] last five games, they’re playing at the 14th-fastest pace in the league,” Dellera explains. “Even though that’s still in the middle, it’s a significant jump off 29th for the season.” Couple that with the Knicks’ defensive issues and inability to limit opposition free throw attempts, and Dellera believes there could be a good amount of points in this matchup. Dellera also found value in two player props for the matchup: James Harden over 23.5 points and Tyrese Maxey over 16.5 points. In terms of Harden, Dellera believes the market hasn’t caught up to the fact Harden has the ball in his hands more often than in Brooklyn. For Maxey, Dellera’s bet comes down a unique statistical trend since the arrival of Harden.  “He’s taking about five more shots per game [since the arrival of Harden],” Dellera explains. Given Maxey is averaging 24.5 points/game over his last two outings, Dellera believes he can clear this number with relative ease.
