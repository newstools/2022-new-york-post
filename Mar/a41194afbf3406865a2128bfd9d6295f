President Biden is considering a trip to Europe in the coming weeks focused on the Ukraine invasion, according to a new report. Five sources familiar with the discussions inside the White House told NBC News that the president might visit Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based, during the potential trip. The potential European trip comes as Ukraine endures the 19th day of Russia’s devastating invasion, and comes on the coattails of Vice President Kamala Harris’ own visit to the region. Harris traveled to Poland and Romania to meet with the country’s respective leaders and affirm the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine and NATO. During her visit, the vice president also spoke with US and Polish service members stationed in Warsaw — which is approximately 186 miles from the border of Ukraine. Some staff who accompanied Harris on her trip stayed behind in Europe to help plan for Biden’s potential travels, three administration officials told the outlet. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also made a trip to Poland to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart along the border. “The entire world stands with Ukraine, just as I am standing here in Ukraine with my friend, my colleague,” Blinken said at the time. Biden’s potential trip to Europe has yet to be finalized and the exact timing of it has not been revealed. The White House declined to confirm the possible trip to The Post on Monday.
