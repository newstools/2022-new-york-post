Saint Peter’s has enjoyed the popularity of saints. Local basketball fans looking for the next area team with title hopes now can root for, well, Blue Devils in Kyrie Irving’s case. The magical run for the Peacocks that put a tiny Jersey City school on the map, that inspired every mid-major around the country, that captivated the same fans whose brackets they busted, has ended. The final — a 69-49 win by No. 8 North Carolina on Sunday — was deceiving. Saint Peter’s was never in the game, down 9-0 after three-and-a-half minutes and 27-9 with 6:02 to play in the first half. The Peacocks, finally looking like the No. 15 seed they were, had their hopes dashed once they entered Wells Fargo Center.
