Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Mets’ spring training action on Saturday: Eduardo Escobar unloaded his first homer of the spring — a solo blast against Kyle Finnegan in the sixth inning — that helped the Mets to a 4-2 victory over the Nationals at Clover Park. Robinson Cano went hitless in three at-bats and is 1-for-9 (.111) this spring. Cano started at second base with Jeff McNeil in right field. Chasen Shreve, a third lefty competing for a spot in the Mets bullpen, pitched a scoreless eighth inning with one strikeout. Shreve, Alex Claudio and Rob Zastryzny have eight combined appearances this spring without allowing an earned run. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer will face the Cardinals in Port St. Lucie. DeGrom is scheduled for three innings with Scherzer expected to throw the next five or six.
