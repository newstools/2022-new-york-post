Matthew Stafford and wife Kelly‘s memorable offseason kept rolling this weekend. The longtime couple attended the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills on Sunday, a little over a month after Stafford, 34, and the Rams defeated the Bengals in the Super Bowl. Both dressed in black attire, the Staffords met up with Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey inside the bash, along with his girlfriend of nearly three years, Olivia Culpo. The foursome posed for photos, with McCaffrey, 25, sporting a black tux while the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model, 29, wore a pink off-the-shoulder number. Throughout the night, Culpo — who has been dating McCaffrey since 2019 — posted a collection of photos and videos from the Oscars bash on her Instagram Story. In one clip, McCaffrey is seen smiling and moving his head to “Sweet Dreams.” “I know the nights heading in a good direction when I see this small move,” Culpo quipped. Earlier in the night, McCaffrey and Culpo shared a kiss on the red carpet before making their way inside the party. Although Kelly didn’t share any snaps from inside the soiree on her social media page, the “Morning After” podcast host did say the Vanity Fair bash is “something [she’ll] never forget.” In addition to Stafford, a fellow Super Bowl-winning quarterback was also in attendance at Sunday’s party: newly minted Bronco Russell Wilson and his wife, Ciara. Wilson, who played in Seattle for the first 10 years of his NFL career, was traded to Denver earlier this month in what has been one of the wildest quarterback moves this offseason.
