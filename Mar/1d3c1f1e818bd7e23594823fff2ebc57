Brooke Shields has parted with a Pacific Palisades home she’s had since 1989. The actress and model initially bought the home for $3.24 million at the time — a few years after her iconic appearances on the front cover of Vogue. The lucky buyer? Actor Sam Page and his wife, Cassidy Elliott, who were able to negotiate a near $600,000 price cut, at $7.4 million. The five-bedroom, 5.5 bathroom abode has been on and off the rental market over the years, since 2015. Spanning over 5,300 square feet, the home is nestled in a secluded canyon in the Upper Riviera and boasts canyon and mountain views, the previous listing notes. Pegged as a “tranquil retreat,” features include a gated private driveway, a two-story foyer with walls of windows surrounding the home and a wrap-around patio. The primary suite on the third floor offers an office, sitting room, a fireplace, a balcony and sauna. Outdoor features include a multiple decks including a dining and barbecue area, pool and spa. Jade Mills and Albert Sousa of Coldwell Banker Realty held the listing; Cody Garcia of the Agency represented Page. “The home is filled with so much character and offers some of the best canyon views that expand all the way out to the Getty,” Garcia told The Post. “The private estate is sure to be a wonderful family home that will bring many great memories to come.” Meanwhile, Page, known as the face of Hallmark films, and who has snagged roles in snag roles in “Desperate Housewives,” “Scandal,” “House of Cards,” “Mad Men” and “The Bold Type,” listed his own four-bedroom, four-bathroom Pacific Palisades. As he upgrades to a much larger abode, Page, 45, has already found a buyer to his 2,815 square-feet abode, only two weeks after it first hit the market for $3.95 million.
