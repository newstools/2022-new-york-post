Seton Hall takes on TCU in a Round of 64 NCAA Tournament on Friday in San Diego, here are their three keys to victory. TCU is a poor shooting team, hitting just 30.4 percent of its 3-point attempts, but the Big 12 school makes up for it by crashing the offensive glass. The Horned Frogs are fourth in the country in offensive rebounding percentage at 36.2 percent. The Pirates need to limit those second-chance opportunities. Seton Hall should be productive in the paint. TCU lacks an eraser around the rim, which will make it important for Jared Rhoden, Kadary Richmond and Alexis Yetna to get into the lane rather than firing from the perimeter. The nation’s fifth-ranked shot-blocker at 3.3 rejections per game, Seton Hall center Ike Obiagu has to stay out of foul trouble to neutralize TCU’s activity around the basket.
