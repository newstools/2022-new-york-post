Rory McIlroy had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill Club & Lodge in Orlando. McIlroy shot a 76, for four-over par, on both Saturday and Sunday. As a result, he dropped from a tie for second to a tie for 13th in the tournament, as high winds wreaked havoc on the field. McIlroy had entered the weekend at seven-under par, finishing the tournament at one-over. “I feel punch drunk, to be honest,” he said. “The weekend, it’s like crazy golf. You just don’t get rewarded for good shots. Like I’m venting here and I’m frustrated and whatever. I think as well the frustration is it’s a carbon copy of what’s happened the last three years here. I started off really, really well with a 66 or 65. Friday afternoon conditions got a little tougher. Then over the weekend it’s sort of been the same stuff.” McIlroy was looking forward to a day off to regroup. “As I said, I just need a day off tomorrow to forget about what’s happened this week and then just sort of focus on next week,” McIlroy said. Later, he provided some suggestions for making the course less “penal.” “I think it’s just a golf course setup issue and maybe just trying to make it a little less penal when you miss, I guess,” McIlroy said. “Or not even less penal when you miss. I don’t mind golf courses being penal when you miss, but it’s not rewarding good shots. I think that’s where it starts to get across the line.” McIlroy, 32, has won 20 PGA Tour tournaments, including four majors.
