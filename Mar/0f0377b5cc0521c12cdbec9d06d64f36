An aggressive panhandler beat a 91-year-old man with a cane in Brooklyn when the senior only forked over $4, new video shows. The elderly man was sitting on a stoop at East 14th Street and Avenue I in Midwood just before 6:30 a.m. Monday when a man — who walked with a limp and used a cane — allegedly demanded cash, according to cops and the footage. The victim handed over $4, but that wasn’t enough for the suspect — who struck him in the head with the cane, according to cops and the video. The senior used his own cane to defend himself, and the attacker fled to a bus stop at Avenue J and East 16 Street, where he boarded an eastbound B6 MTA bus, cops said. The victim was later taken to New York Community Hospital by Hatzolah for head pain and a cut above his eye, police said.
