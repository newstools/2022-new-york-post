Cam Reddish finally worked his way into some playing time with the Knicks only to be sidelined by a right shoulder injury. Reddish, who initially played sparingly upon arrival in a January trade from the Hawks, was injured on an awkward crash to the floor after trying to block a shot by Davion Mitchell in the fourth quarter of Monday’s win over the Kings in Sacramento. Reddish has been ruled out of Wednesday’s game against the Mavericks in Dallas with what the Knicks reported as a sprained shoulder, but the team revealed no other details about the injury or a time frame for a return. He was spotted after Monday’s game “walking into the Knicks’ locker room with his right arm in a sling,” according to a tweet by reporter Sean Cunningham of ABC10 in Sacramento. The 22-year-old forward has missed significant time in each of his first three NBA seasons — with groin, Achilles and ankle injuries. The Hawks drafted the former Duke star with the 10th-overall pick in 2019, seven picks after the Knicks grabbed his former college teammate RJ Barrett. Reddish was acquired by the Knicks for a first-round pick and one-time lottery pick Kevin Knox. He has averaged 18.5 minutes per game in six games since the All-Star break, including a 17-point effort in 25 minutes in Sunday’s win in Los Angeles against the Clippers. Mitchell Robinson has been listed as questionable after playing just two minutes Monday against the Kings due to an illness. Obi Toppin (hamstring), Nerlens Noel (foot) and Quentin Grimes (knee) also remain out. Former Knicks Tim Hardaway Jr. (left foot surgery), Frank Ntilikina (non-COVID illness) and Theo Pinson (fractured finger) are out for the Mavericks, and point guard Jalen Brunson has been listed as questionable with a right foot contusion. Forward Marquese Chriss also is out due to knee soreness.
