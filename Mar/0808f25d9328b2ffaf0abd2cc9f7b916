A 13-year-old boy was driving a pickup truck that struck a van in Texas and killed nine people — including six New Mexico college golfers  — in a fiery crash, authorities said Thursday The boy, identified in a Daily Mail report as Ricky Siemens, was driving illegally on a spare tire before it blew out and the truck slammed head-on into a van carrying golfers from the University of the Southwest Tuesday night, said National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Bruce Landsberg. The teen and his 38-year-old dad Henrich Siemens — who were heading to pick up a new car — also died in the collision, according to authorities and Siemens’  heartbroken widow. “They were going to pick up a car that [Siemens] bought. I was supposed to see him about two hours later,” she said, adding they left around 8 p.m. The crash killed college golfers Mauricio Sanchez, 19, Travis Garcia, 19, Jackson Zinn, 22, Karisa Raines, 21, Laci Stone, 18, and Tiago Sousa, 18. Their coach, Tyler James, who was driving the Ford van, was also killed. Dayton Price, 19, and Hayden Underhill, 20, the two survivors of the crash, are in stable condition, officials said. “This was clearly a high-speed collision,” Landsberg said, adding it was unclear how fast the vehicles were traveling. The cause of the crash had not been determined Thursday but cops have ordered toxicology and other forensics reports, Sgt. Steven Blanco of Texas DPS told The Post. Texas law requires motorists to be at least 15 years old to receive a provisional license and at least 14 before they can take classes to get a learner’s license. The college’s Ford Transit van was carrying nine people and towing a box trailer while heading back from a golf tournament in Midland, where both the women’s and men’s teams were competing. The accident remains under investigation. With AP wires
