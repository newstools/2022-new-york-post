A British man said local legislators are shark-raving mad for landmarking his father’s infamous home. Designed as a protest against nuclear weapons, the 25-foot sculpture depicts a shark diving into the roof of an Oxford home. It was installed in 1986 by Bill Hanson-Heine, against the wishes of the Oxford City Council. However, the council has apparently grown quite fond of the controversial “Shark House.” This week, city planners voted to add the home to the Oxford Heritage Asset Register. Hanson-Heine died in 2019, and his son, Magnus, now owns the home. “Using the planning apparatus to preserve a historical symbol of planning law defiance is absurd on the face of it,” said Magnus Hanson-Heine, a quantum chemist. Bill Hanson-Heine, an American who studied law at Oxford, commissioned the sculpture after he saw US planes fly over his house to bomb Libya in 1986. They installed it on Aug. 9, 1986, 41 years to the day after the United States nuked Nagasaki. With Post wires
