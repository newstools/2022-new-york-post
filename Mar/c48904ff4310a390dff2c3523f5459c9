DUNEDIN, Fla. — The Blue Jays still figure that Brett Gardner and the Yankees will find their way back to each other. Nevertheless, Toronto has engaged the representatives of the free-agent outfielder just in case. The Yankees have yet to make their intentions with Gardner public. At present, the plan is to use Aaron Judge as the backup center fielder to Aaron Hicks with Estevan Florial and Ender Inciarte available for depth as either a fifth outfielder or at Triple-A. Gardner’s representatives has said the veteran intends to play a 15th season. But clubs that could be interested wonder if Gardner, 38, is so aligned with the Yankees that if he cannot latch on with them he just retires. The Blue Jays have a heavily righty hitting lineup. They would like to add a spare lefty-hitting outfielder with plate patience — an asset of Gardner’s throughout his career. If Gardner is interested in playing somewhere besides the Yankees, multiple executives told The Post they believe he could get a major league contract somewhere because he can still run, defend and is viewed as a hard-working clubhouse leader.
