PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Giants continue to add low-priced, experienced offensive linemen. The newest member of the club is Max Garcia, who signed a one-year deal to add depth to a position group that went into the offseason with only five healthy players on the entire roster. Garcia, 30, has 52 NFL starts on his résumé, including 11 last season for the Cardinals. In 2016 and 2017, he was a full-time starter for the Broncos, the team that selected him out of the University of Florida in 2015 in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. In his NFL career, Garcia has 39 regular-season starts at left guard, nine at right guard and four at center. His one postseason start was at right guard. Thus far in free agency, new general manager Joe Schoen is shopping from the discount rack to restock the depth chart.  He added guard Mike Glowinski, center Jon Feliciano, tackle Matt Gono, guard Jamil Douglas and now Garcia. Schoen also re-signed tackle Korey Cunningham, who was on the Giants’ practice squad in 2021. Glowinski is the only new lineman who received longer than a one-year contract. Glowinski, a former starter for the Colts, signed a three-year deal worth $18.3 million and he is expected to move in as the starting right guard. Garcia was ranked No. 66 among all guards in 2022 by Pro Football Focus, allowing four sacks and 17 total pressures. Glowinski was ranked No. 21 and Feliciano No. 59 with the Bills. Will Hernandez, a starting guard for the Giants the past four years, ranked No. 60 last season, according to PFF. The only returning offensive lineman expected to remain in the starting lineup is left tackle Andrew Thomas. Shane Lemieux played in only one game last season before requiring knee surgery. He is expected to be healthy this season and will compete for the starting right guard spot.
