Colgate and Navy will play for the Patriot League championship, with a bid to the NCAA Tournament on the line. It’s become a familiar stop for the Raiders. Navy will look to pull the upset on the back of one of the best scoring defenses in the country. Gametime: 7:30 pm EST TV: CBS Sports Network Live Stream: ESPN App, FuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV A win by the Midshipmen — who haven’t reached the NCAA Tournament since 1998 — is a much better story, but a Colgate victory makes it even more likely that we will see madness next week. The Raiders, who are making their fifth straight Patriot League title game appearance, will again be a sharpshooting, first-round threat in the Big Dance, having lost one game in the past two months. Colgate, which swept the season series against Navy, can win on the strength of the second-best 3-point-shooting unit in the nation or through 6-foot-10 Keegan Records, who had 25 points (11 of 13 shooting) against Navy’s undersized frontline in the first meeting.
