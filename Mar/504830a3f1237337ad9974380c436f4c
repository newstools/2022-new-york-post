Bawdy female guidance counselors at a Brooklyn charter school subjected a male colleague to explicit conversations about sex and penis preferences for years — and he was fired for complaining, he claims in a lawsuit. Alexis Garraway says the humiliating abuse at New Dawn Charter High School began in 2019, when lead counselor Janisha Crawley struck up a conversation about what she “sexually wanted” in a man, according to the lawsuit filed last week in Brooklyn federal court. Crawley said she needed a penis at least “seven inches” long — and “thick” with “good stiffness,” according to court papers. “Yes, baby!” a fellow counselor, Beranda Felder, allegedly chimed in. Garraway was berated with such horny heart-to-hearts daily, with the randy pair “openly and loudly” discussing past and present partners, complete with “graphic details,” his suit says. “Crawley and Felder even started allowing female students at the school to come into the office and openly discuss their intimate sexual relationships in return for advice,” the suit alleges. Garraway complained to the administration — but says that instead of putting a stop to the “sexual harassment,” the bosses ratted him out to Crawley, who then chewed him out. In 2021, Crawley was promoted and became his direct supervisor, with the administration again taking no action in response to his complaints, the suit says. In a meeting that year with operations director Jose Obregon and HR director Steve Ramkissoon, Garraway was told he needed to “show more courtesy to female co-workers and work better with them,” according to court papers. “We have to be sensitive.  Women have special needs,” Obregon allegedly said. Six weeks later Garraway was fired. He is demanding $68,286.40 in lost wages plus damages. Garraway’s lawyer, and Crawley, Felder, and Obregon, did not return messages. New Dawn executive director Sara Asmussen declined comment.
