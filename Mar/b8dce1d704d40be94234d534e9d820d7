Pete Davidson has another job under his belt. The 28-year-old is teaming up with his “Saturday Night Live” boss Lorne Michaels for a new comedy series, “Bupkis.” The comedian and Kim Kardashian’s boyfriend will star as a fictionalized version of himself in the series based on his life, Deadline reported. Davidson is co-writing the show with his long-time collaborator Dave Sirus and Judah Miller. While negations are still being discussed,  Michaels’ Broadway Video and Universal Television company is producing the project. The outlet described “Bupkis” as a “raw, unflinching, fictionalized version of Pete Davidson’s real life. It will include a mixture of grounded storytelling with absurd elements depicting an unfiltered view through Pete’s eyes.” The comedy has been pitched to streaming services such as Amazon’s Prime Video and NBC’s Peacock. Several A-listers are currently in talks to star with the “King of Staten Island” actor. Davidson’s upcoming series reportedly has a Larry David “Curb Your Enthusiasm” vibe to it, as viewers will get a chance to see the “SNL” cast member’s real personality through his raunchy and NSFW anecdotes and storytelling. This show won’t be the first one from the “SNL” family that Michaels has produced in recent years. His past TV projects have included Aidy Bryant’s “Shrill,” Cecily Strong’s “Schmigadoon!,” Michael Che’s “That Damn Michael Che” and the “Bust Down” with Chris Redd. The New York native is currently in his eighth season on the long-running NBC comedy sketch show. However, he is on hiatus from the program in order to film his horror picture, “The Home.” Davidson is playing Max in the film, who is a young man who begins working at a retirement home and comes to realize that the residents are concealing scary secrets. Max explores the building and its forgotten fourth floor, where he starts to learn about his own past as an orphan child. The screamer started production in late January.
