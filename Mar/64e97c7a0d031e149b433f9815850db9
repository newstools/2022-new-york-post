With March 21 on the horizon, the needs that have been self-evident since mid-November have not changed. Indeed, the need to create a third line and to add a top-six piece on the right side has crystalized. The cap issues — that will strike with the start of next season and continue through a cycle in which second contracts will be required for Kaapo Kakko (for 2022-23) and Alexis Lafreniere and K’Andre Miller (2023-24) while the expensive deals for Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad, Adam Fox, Jacob Trouba and Chris Kreider remain on the books — have not changed. The available names have not changed, either, though potential rental acquisitions such as Anaheim’s Rickard Rakell and Winnipeg’s Andrew Copp suffered injuries of unknown severity over the weekend. The Rangers have all this cap space on hand — an estimated $32 million by next Monday, according to Natural Stat Trick — but it’s not as if anyone would be coming for free.
