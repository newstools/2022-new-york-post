A suspected gunman who shot four people Saturday near the South By Southwest festival in Austin is in police custody, officials said Sunday morning. The shooter opened fire at the intersection of East 6th and Neches streets, officials said. The Austin-Travis County EMS said all the victims were taken to a local trauma hospital with what are expected to be non-life-threatening injuries. Austin city officials are asking festival-goers to avoid the Sabine and East 7th streets intersection as another possible shooting has been reported. Police are continuing the investigation and also asking people to avoid the area. They say there is no threat to the public. SXSW is a festival and conference event focusing on music, tech, and film. This year’s festivities started on March 11 and are scheduled to end with a Los Bitchos concert on Sunday.
