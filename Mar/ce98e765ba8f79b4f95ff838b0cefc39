Burger King is making some deep-fried cuts to its menu to increase profits and offset soaring food and labor costs. The fast food giant will reduce the number of chicken nuggets in its meals from 10 to eight, according to Carrols Restaurant Group, which operates 14 percent of all of the Burger Kings in the US. “The Burger King brand has about a dozen menu and promotional initiatives, some of which have already been implemented, and some that will be implemented over the course of this year,” Carrols CEO Dan Accordino told investors last week in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings presentation. “Recent actions in this regard from our franchisor include lifting price caps on value menu items and reducing the number of nuggets in meals from 10 pieces to eight,” he said on the call, held Thursday. The shrinking nugget meal is just one action aiming to boost “restaurant-level profitability” amid growing prices of meat, fuel and worker salaries, he said. “The Whopper, the brand’s most popular product by a wide margin, has also been removed as a core discount item,” he said. “We believe this to be one of the most impactful initiatives underway.” The signature sandwich is no longer offered in two-for-$6 or two-for-$5 promotional deals, the CEO said. The shrinking nugget meal was the first change in count in Burger King history and went into effect in the third-quarter of 2021, a spokesperson told Fox Business. “Moving forward, we’ll continue to innovate on nuggets, offering guests both a competitive price and differentiated product not found anywhere else,” the spokesperson said. The company recently unveiled Ghost Pepper nuggets, according to the spokesperson. Carrols reported a 7.4 percent increase in Burger King sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a 12.1 percent increase in the average check driven by beefed up menu prices. The franchisee operates 1,027 Burger Kings and 65 Popeyes in the US.
