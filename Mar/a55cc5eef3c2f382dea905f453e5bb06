A full-floor co-op at 1 Fifth Ave. — a Greenwich Village building tied to a number of high-profile names — is on the market for $5.99 million, down from its $8.5 million ask in 2019. The 25th-floor tower unit, featuring two bedrooms and two bathrooms, has been in the same hands for more than two decades. One Fifth is a landmarked Art Deco building that dates to 1927, and it’s seen some real pedigree in its day. The building is home to Jessica Lange, who bought two units in the building. It’s where Robert Mapplethorpe shot Patti Smith’s “Horses” album cover — and where Helena Bonham Carter lived with Tim Burton before their 2014 split. It’s also been home to Gwyneth Paltrow’s mom, actress Blythe Danner. And it has also been the setting for a bestselling novel, “One Fifth Avenue,” by Candace Bushnell. Rock royalty Keith Richards also once owned there, as did “Scarface” director Brian De Palma. The building is close to Washington Square Park and the unit comes with stunning city views including the Empire State Building. There are two large, and separate, bedroom wings, and each comes with an ensuite bathroom. (There’s also room to carve out a third bedroom or a home office.) The residence features a loft-like open living/dining room that is more than 64 feet, and an open kitchen. Original details include hardwood floors and picture windows. Built as an apartment-hotel for the rich in 1927 by Harvey Wiley Corbett, and developed by Joseph G. Siegel, the building features a two-story lobby, doormen a laundry room. The listing broker is Douglas Elliman’s William Martin.
