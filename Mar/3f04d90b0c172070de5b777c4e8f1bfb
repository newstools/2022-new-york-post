Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Mets’ spring training on Sunday: Daniel Palka went 2-for-2 with two RBIs in the Mets’ 6-4 exhibition loss to the Cardinals in Port St. Lucie. Palka, a first baseman/outfielder, doubled and was the only Mets player with an extra-base hit. Sean Reid-Foley allowed one run on two hits and a walk in the eighth inning. The right-hander struck out three batters in the inning. The Cardinals brought most of their regular players on the road for the game. Paul Goldschmidt, Tyler O’Neill, Nolan Arenado, Dylan Carlson and Harrison Bader were among the players in the lineup. Max Scherzer will debut for the Mets in the Grapefruit League, against the Marlins in Jupiter, Fla.
