Any woman will know that maintaining your eyebrows is no easy task. And let’s face it, from being too over-plucked to looking like slugs, we’ve all heard a horror story or two. So when Abigail, who is from the UK, turned to a friend for help, she thought she was in safe hands… Taking to TikTok, Abigail shared a short clip and explained: “When you let your ‘mate’ tattoo your eyebrows.” She could then be seen rolling her eyes and pointing to her eyebrow, which clearly showed a second brow inked above her natural one – giving the very unfortunate illusion of two eyebrows. In the background, the song by Muni Long could be playing with the lyrics blaring out: “I wish I had a time machine.” Abigail captioned the post: “It be your friends who hate on you.” The video has since received over 21,000 likes – and many of her social media followers were left gobsmacked by the eyebrow fail. “NOOOOOOO IMAGINE,” wrote one. A second commented: “No joke I’ll donate to the go fund me for laser.” Meanwhile, a third added: “I’m so sorry girl!!? Still look fire though” while a fourth wrote: “This can’t be real.” Another asked: “How are you still friends with them?” Elsewhere, a further advised: “You can have a solution tattooed that will get rid…and in future if you want it done make sure the follow ur natural shape.” In response, Abigail replied: “Ermmm… I didn’t do this to my face,” followed by a laughing face emoji.
