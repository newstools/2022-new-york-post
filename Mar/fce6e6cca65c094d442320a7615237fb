President Joe Biden doubled down Monday on his “this man cannot remain in power” remark over the weekend about Vladimir Putin, while admitting it’s not US policy, just “more an aspiration than anything.” That is, he’s now claiming that an American president gets to say whatever comes into his head, without consequences. This is, to put it mildly, new. For decades, presidents have chosen their words carefully precisely because the office has such vast power. But Biden can’t be bothered, or maybe just . . .  can’t. Worse, he spent much of that press conference in an alternate reality, insisting that none of his bungles on the trip (threatening a chemical attack on Russia, telling the 82nd Airborne they were headed into Ukraine) had been walked back by his staff and even Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Worse, he insisted “none of the three occurred,” because the people he was actually talking to understood what he meant. As if the whole world weren’t always watching a US president speak on grave matters of war. This much is true: A sympathetic, informed listener familiar with Biden’s ways can figure out what’s going on. But that’s not enough (nor was it for the last guy): Lots of people won’t understand, and America’s enemies (heck, Biden’s enemies) will exploit every fumble. Also true: Biden’s staff does its best to keep reporters away, because even with his cheat sheets the man can’t control his mouth. But it’s not working. Pray that the staff (or Democratic powerbrokers) can get someone of stature (former President Barack Obama?) to read him the riot act, because Biden clearly intends to go on like this. Loose lips sink ships, and a president’s loose lips can sink us all.
