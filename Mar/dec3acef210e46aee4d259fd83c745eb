A woman was stabbed to death early Saturday in Leonia, NJ, in what police said was a domestic violence incident. Alicia Arnone, 35, was found with a fatal stab wound in a garden apartment at 147 Grand Ave., near the Leonia Tennis Club, after someone called 911, according to a spokeswoman for the Bergen County Prosecutor’s office. Police sources told the Daily Voice they were searching for a Bergen County man with a 20-year criminal history involving assaults, threats, harassment and violating restraining orders in connection with the murder. The victim’s father, Peter, called Alicia his “sweet angel” on his Facebook page and alluded to her “three year battle with the state of New Jersey regarding domestic violence, having shown evidence after evidence after evidence of domestic abuse with arrest warrants issued and never carried out.” A pit bull was seen being taken away from the crime scene in an animal protection vehicle. Leonia Police Chief Scott Tamagny referred all inquiries to the prosecutor’s office.
