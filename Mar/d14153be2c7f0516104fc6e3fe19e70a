British race car driver Lewis Hamilton admitted that he’s been struggling mentally and emotionally “for a long time” in a candid note that he posted on social media Thursday. The seven-time world champion took to his Instagram stories, writing, “It has been such a tough year already with everything that is happening around us. Hard some days to stay positive. I have struggled mentally and emotionally for a long time, to keep going is a [constant] effort but we have to keep fighting, we have so much to do and to achieve. “I’m writing to tell you it’s ok to feel the way you do, just know that you are not alone and that we are gonna get through this! A friend reminded me today, you are so powerful & you can do anything you put your mind to! We can do anything we put our mind to. Let’s remember to live in gratitude for another day to rise. Sending you love and light.” Hamilton’s post came after the Formula One star finished a surprising 10th in last Sunday’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where drivers nearly staged a boycott over safety fears after an attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on a nearby oil storage facility. “I am so happy the weekend is done,” Hamilton said after the attack. “I am so happy that everyone is safe, I am just looking forward to getting out. I just want to go home.” After Hamilton crossed the finish line and was told of his 10th-place finish, he wondered aloud on the team’s radio if he would even get any points. “Is there even a point for that position?” Hamilton said during the cooldown lap. “Eh, yeah, you do get a point…” replied race engineer Pete Bonnington. Only one other time in the last decade has Hamilton finished as low as 10th in a race. The next race for Hamilton and his Mercedes team is the Australian Grand Prix on April 10.
