When you talk sports as hard as you can, sometimes there are consequences. In his weekly Wednesday co-hosting role on ESPN’s “First Take,” Chris “Mad Dog” Russo railed on Aaron Rodgers, saying the Packers quarterback has been bad in the playoffs since his Super Bowl win over a decade ago and to go away and “go host Jeopardy!” As the segment continued to get hot and heavy, an emotional Russo — on an aside about how Vince Lombardi was spinning in his grave over the horrific performance of Matt LaFleur’s Packers special teams in their home playoff loss to the 49ers — fell out of his chair and could not immediately make his way back in. Molly Qerim offered to help him get back in his seat. Dog would have none of it, insisting he could do it himself. However, he could not immediately accomplish that goal. “WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH THAT CHAIR?!” he barked. Stephen A. Smith cracked up, as one should. After what must have felt like an hour for him, Dog got back in the chair, and immediately launched back into how much blame Rodgers does or doesn’t deserve for Green Bay’s postseason collapse.
