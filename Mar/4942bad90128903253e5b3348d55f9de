Four US Marines are officially missing, and likely dead, after an aircraft crash during a NATO exercise in Norway. “Four Marines assigned to 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, II Marine Expeditionary Force are currently listed in Duty Status Whereabouts Unknown following an aviation incident involving an MV-22B Osprey during a training mission in support of Exercise Cold Response 2022 near Bodo, Norway,” 1st Lt. Jacob Sugg of the Marines said in an email to The Post on Saturday. Friday’s training mission crash is under investigation by American and Norwegian authorities. The service members will not be publicly identified until 24 hours after next-of-kin were notified, Sugg said. The annual NATO drills included about 30,000 troops, 220 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 countries. The exercises began last week and finish on April 1. Norway said Cold Response would “carry on as planned, with the measures we have to take due to the weather.” With Post wires
