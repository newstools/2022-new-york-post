The Texas A&M Aggies are riding back-to-back upsets of Auburn and Arkansas in the SEC tournament, and pose a legitimate threat to Tennessee for the conference championship. Once again entering a game as an underdog, the Aggies are a good bet to cover. Gametime: 1:00pm EST TV: ESPN Live Stream: ESPN App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Only two teams seeded lower than seventh have ever won the SEC Tournament. Following upsets of Auburn and Arkansas, it wouldn’t seem strange to see the eighth-seeded Aggies take home the title. This season, nothing seems strange in College Station. The Aggies opened the season 15-2, then lost eight straight games. Now, sitting squarely on the bubble, A&M enters the championship with seven straight wins. If the Aggies — 11-5 against the spread as an underdog — go down, it won’t be quietly.
