The No. 3 seed Texas Tech Red Raiders will square off with the No. 6 Iowa State Cyclones in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 Tournament. The Red Raiders hold opponents to the ninth-fewest points per game, and will set their sights on stifling the Cyclones in an effort to reach the semifinals. Gametime: 9:30pm EST TV: ESPN2 Live Stream: ESPN App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The rock-fight rubber match shouldn’t look much different than the first pair of offensively challenged affairs. While the Red Raiders’ top-ranked defense has earned great acclaim without Chris Beard, the Cyclones have quietly boasted a top-10 unit, likely to once again stymie the 284th-ranked perimeter shooting team into another embarrassing effort from outside.
