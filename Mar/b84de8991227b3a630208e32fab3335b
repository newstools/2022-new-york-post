What in the ham sandwich? Ellie Kemper is looking to sell her Manhattan home! Kemper, known to many as the star of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” — a Netflix sitcom in which she played a woman rescued from a doomsday cult who’s adjusting to life in New York City — will list her elegantly designed Upper West Side co-op for $3.35 million, The Post has learned. The renovated unit, adorned with pastel-toned walls and handsome herringbone hardwood floors, has three bedrooms and three full bathrooms — and opens off a semi-private elevator vestibule. Kemper, a Missouri native and an alumna of Princeton University, purchased the prewar pad alongside her husband — the comedian and television writer Michael Koman — for $2.8 million, according to records filed with the city Department of Finance in early 2016. Kemper, who also had a role in the hilarious 2011 film “Bridesmaids,” wasn’t available for comment on this listing. Inside the apartment, an entrance gallery leads to side-by-side living, dining and great rooms, with three exposures that look out to townhouse gardens and Japanese maple trees. There are also ceilings 10 feet high, enlarged bay windows — and listing images even show a fireplace. But while the old world style comes through in the unit’s look, there is a blend of new. There’s through-the-wall air conditioning, new double-pane thermal windows, a full electrical upgrade and a washer/dryer. The eat-in kitchen, with top-grade appliances, has custom cabinets and granite countertops. Elsewhere, the master bedroom has plenty of closet space and a marble ensuite bathroom. Listing images additionally show period moldings and space for a home office. “The distinctive architectural grace of the home, the building and the location drew my clients to this beautiful apartment, and their stunning renovation will sing to this market,” said Maria Manuche, of Compass, who shares this listing with Clare Cukier.
