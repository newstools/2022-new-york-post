It’s deception in its sweetest form. A new Netflix show asks one of life’s essential questions: “Is It Cake?” Premiering on Friday, March 18, skilled bakers make cakes that look uncannily like everyday objects from conch shells to coolers. Their goal is to fool a panel of celebrity judges with their imitation creations — and vie for a $50,000 grand prize. Host Mikey Day then gleefully reveals whether or not it is cake by cutting into the object. The “Saturday Night Live” star told Yahoo he was nervous at first to gash the gateau as there was only one shot but then: “I feel like I became an expert on cutting cakes! A big portion of the show is the reveal.” So make Marie Antoinette proud and see if you can tell the cake fakes from their real-life counterparts by taking The Post’s quiz below.
