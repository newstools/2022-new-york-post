In the last year or two, have you noticed more boys are being born? If you have, it’s not just you. A baby nurse also said she’s noticed a big uptick in women pregnant with boys last year. The nurse named Kara revealed in a video that there’s actually a scientific phenomenon that could explain the boom in boys. She said it might be the result of something called the “returning soldier effect.” Kara explained that the effect is a theory that the number of boys being born increases after wars and times of stress, like a global pandemic. “The idea is that men who are taller, stronger, more likely to survive, more likely to make it home and procreate, and for some reason more likely to produce male offspring.” She then referred to a chart of babies born from 2018 to 2020 and explained that every year, there are slightly more boys born in the US than girls. We’ll have to wait until the numbers for 2021 and 2022 are released to see if the trend continues or spikes, Kara said. According to Psychology Today, the returning soldier effect was first noticed in 1954 following World War II and the Korean War, but there’s evidence it occurred in the UK after World War I as well. The British soldiers who survived World War I were found to be one inch taller than those who were killed. The site also concluded that taller parents are more likely to produce sons than shorter parents. So interestingly enough, the spike in boys born during and after World War I could have been the result of taller soldiers returning home.
