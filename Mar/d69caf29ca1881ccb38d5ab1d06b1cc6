The suspect in last weekend’s stabbing at the Museum of Modern Art was apprehended in Philadelphia early Tuesday morning, according to the NYPD. Gary Cabana, 60, had been on the lam since the incident on Saturday night. He was apprehended by Philadelphia police at about 1:36 a.m. and is awaiting extradition to New York for arrest and charges. Although he remained at large, Cabana opened up to a Post reporter on Instagram on Sunday night. “When they said I couldn’t go upstairs to see STARRY STARYY NIGHT EVER AGAIN I lost it.” After losing his job in January, Cabana was also charged with a criminal harassment complaint after sending threatening emails to a woman at the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees office. Authorities suspected Cabana may have fled to Philadelphia when a lookalike checked in to a Best Western Motel under the name “Joseph Cabana.” On his social media accounts, Cabana listed his middle name as “Joe.” Philadelphia Police were also looking for Cabana after the Best Western guest started a fire in his room, causing the motel to be evacuated on Monday night.
