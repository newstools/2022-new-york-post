China’s Shanghai Disneyland has closed its pearly white doors temporarily after the country saw a rise in coronavirus cases. The amusement park posted a “Friendly Reminder” on their website Monday to alert fans of the new change. “Due to the current pandemic situation, Shanghai Disney Resort, including Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown and Wishing Star Park will be temporarily closed from Monday, March 21, 2022,” the company wrote. The memo continued, “We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations.” “We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide refund or exchange for all guests impacted during this period. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! We look forward to seeing you soon,” they concluded. Chinese officials reported 1,807 new symptomatic COVID cases on March 13 and two people died from the virus over the weekend, the first couple in over a year. The Shanghai Disney Resort first put a halt to functionalities because of COVID-19 back in January 2020. They reopened the park in May of that year. However, last November, the Mickey Mouse playground was on lockdown for two days after 33,863 park visitors had to be tested for coronavirus. The parkers had to be locked inside after one woman tested positive from her visit a day earlier. One visitor told the Associated Press she was inside the park when she heard an announcement at 5 p.m. that everyone had to be tested. “No one complained, and everyone behaved really well,” she said. Starting on January 9, 2022, Disneyland Shanghai had increased their ticket prices. A 25% discount was still put into effect for children (aged 3 to 11-years-old), seniors (65-years-old and above) and guests with disabilities (certificate/proof of disability is required). Infants (under the age of 3-years-old) were still admitted for free to the Disney park.
