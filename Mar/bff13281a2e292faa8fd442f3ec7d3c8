A Rhode Island man allegedly killed his girlfriend, wrapped her body in towels and plastic, then stuffed the corpse in the refrigerator of his apartment, cops said. Nathan Cooper, 53, was slapped with a murder charge for the killing of Sherbert Maddox after police found her body inside the Providence apartment on Tuesday, authorities said. Police said they were first called to the apartment on a tip, then obtained a search warrant. Maddox, 40, appeared to have been fatally shot and could have been dead for two or more days, authorities said. A .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun believed to be used in the killing, and a rifle were recovered by cops, The Providence Journal reported. Although reports said the couple shared the apartment where Maddox’s body was found, family told the Journal the victim didn’t live there. Cooper apparently had prior convictions and a pattern of domestic violence with Maddox, according to the newspaper. Relatives of Maddox were left struggling to come to grips with the shocking end of their loved one. “My mom called me this morning and let me know that her boyfriend killed her and put her in the refrigerator like a piece of steak,” cousin Shermaine Johnson told WSAZ-TV. Sister Nakia Maddox Pigues told WPRI that she felt others may have been involved in trying to coverup the murder. “I want the world to know that justice will be served for my sister,” Maddox Pigues said. “You took a part of my family that we can never get back. Your day is coming.” Cooper didn’t enter a plea at his arraignment Wednesday. With Post wires
