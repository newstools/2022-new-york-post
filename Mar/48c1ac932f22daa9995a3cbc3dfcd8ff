New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy tested positive for COVID-19 but is “feeling well” and not showing any symptoms, a spokesman said Thursday. Murphy, 64, is vaccinated and boosted but is considered high risk because he had a cancerous tumor removed from his kidney in 2020, according to NJ.com. “This afternoon, as part of a regularly scheduled testing regime, Governor took a rapid antigen test that came back positive for COVID-19,” communications director Mahen Gunaratna said in a statement. “He subsequently took a PCR test, which also came back positive.” Murphy will isolate for five days and cancel in-person events, Gunaratna said. Anyone who has come into contact with the governor during the potential infection window will be notified, he said. “The Governor has diligently taken precautions to limit the spread of COVID-19 and encourages everyone eligible to get vaccinated and boosted, as he has done, to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus.” Murphy’s wife, Tammy, had tested positive in another breakthrough case in January but the governor and their four children came up negative at the same time. Murphy didn’t quarantine since he was vaccinated, but wore a mask at in-person events following the test, his office said at the time.
