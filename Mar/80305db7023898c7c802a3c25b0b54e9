Hey, New Yorkers, do a good deed today. Place some action for a friend in Jersey. They can return the favor when Colgate takes the floor Friday night. Wednesday’s game between Rutgers and Notre Dame starts at 9:10 p.m. ET. After opening as a favorite, BetMGM has moved the line and made Rutgers the underdog for this contest. While the game is expected to be slow-paced and low-scoring, this should help provide us with an edge for the game. The full prediction for Rutgers vs. Notre Dame is below… Spread: Rutgers: (+1.5) vs. Notre Dame (-1.5) Moneyline: Rutgers (+100) vs. Notre Dame (-120) Total: Over/Under 133.5 Gametime: 9:10 p.m. ET TV Channel: truTV Live Stream: March Madness Live App, Sling TV, Watch truTV App  It was easy money backing Mike Brey during back-to-back Elite Eight runs (2015-16), but the Irish have won just one NCAA Tournament game since then and are appearing in the Big Dance for the first time in five years. This season, Notre Dame finished second in the ACC, but few of its 22 wins hold any value. The Irish went 2-8 in Quad 1 games and enter Wednesday with two losses in their past three games. Rutgers will relish the opportunity to play another slow-paced opponent and frustrate Notre Dame with a physical defense that is built for March (see: last year) and has slowed more talented Big Ten offenses this season. Rutgers will control the glass. Ron Harper Jr. and Geo Baker will control the game. The Scarlet Knights will live to see another round — and maybe more.
