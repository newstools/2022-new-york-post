A Bronx man who allegedly smeared human feces on a woman’s face on a subway platform last week has been arrested, NYPD said. Frank Abrokwa, 37, approached a 43-year-old woman who was sitting on a bench on the southbound platform of the Wakefield–241st Street subway station in The Bronx around 5:15 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 21, cops said. Suddenly, without saying a word, he hit the unsuspecting woman in the face and the back of her head with human feces before fleeing, footage released by police showed. It’s not clear whether the feces was his. Abrokwa was arrested on Monday and charged with forcible touching, menacing, disorderly conduct and harassment. Mayor Eric Adams called the incident a “horrific experience for anyone to go through” at an unrelated press conference Monday afternoon. “Human waste or someone spitting in your face, those are real signs of mental health issues … and we really must dig into how we’re dealing with these mental health issues,” the mayor said. The nauseating incident comes amid a frightening uptick in Big Apple subway crime. In response to the violence, Adams announced his Subway Safety Plan on Feb. 18, pledging to crack down on rule-breaking and preventing people from living on the trains and in the stations. Adams said teams of outreach workers and city cops began last week canvassing the subways to identify mentally ill and homeless people who need to be removed and will work to get them the treatment and housing they need.
