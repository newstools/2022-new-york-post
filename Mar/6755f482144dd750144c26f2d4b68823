Ford is recalling 195,864 pickups and SUVs in the US that may leak brake fluid from the master cylinder and reduce stopping power. The recall covers certain 2016-2018 Ford F-150 pickups and 2016-2017 Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigator SUVs equipped with the 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 engine option. According to the NHTSA report, drivers should see a warning light before braking performance is affected, but they will experience a change in brake feel and a reduction in the effectiveness of the front brakes if the problem is not addressed. Ford previously recalled the F-150 twice for the same issue and knows of four low- speed accidents but no injuries related to it. Affected owners will be notified of the recall starting April 25.
