A pint a day could make your brain pint-sized. According to a recent scientific study, having just one or two alcoholic drinks per day might make your brain smaller — literally. The peer-reviewed paper, published Friday in Nature, found “negative associations” between alcohol consumption and brain size. Harmful effects were “apparent” even in those averaging one or two drinks per day, and “become stronger as alcohol intake increases.” The authors looked at 36,678 brain scans of “generally healthy middle-aged and older adults” stored by the UK Biobank.
