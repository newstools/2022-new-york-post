Microsoft on Friday became the latest big tech company to pull out of Russia amid Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “We will suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia,” vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a blog post that came after other tech firms  including Apple, Dell, Intel also halted sales in the country. “In addition, we are coordinating closely and working in lockstep with the governments of the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and we are stopping many aspects of our business in Russia in compliance with governmental sanctions decisions,” Smith added. Smith did not say how the ban on new sales would affect Microsoft’s existing subscription customers, such as Russian companies that rely on products like Microsoft Office, the Windows operating system and the company’s Azure cloud computing service. It was also unclear whether online gamers who subscribe to Microsoft’s Xbox Live service would be cut off. Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage. Microsoft told The Post it had no comment beyond what it had already said about the pullout. In addition, Smith said that Microsoft has helped protect Ukraine from cyberattacks since Russian troops began pouring into the country last week. “Since the war began, we have acted against Russian positioning, destructive or disruptive measures against more than 20 Ukrainian government, IT and financial sector organizations,” Smith said. “Our single most impactful area of work almost certainly is the protection of Ukraine’s cybersecurity.”
