Jackson Mahomes, the younger brother of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, is fed up with the media attention he’s received while in the spotlight. Mahomes took to his Instagram story on Friday, according to Awesemo, and shared a selfie with the caption, “I hate media/news it’s destroying my life…” In a second selfie post, Mahomes added, “broken/sad/disrespected,” according to a screen grab on Twitter. The social media influencer, who’s known for his viral TikTok dances, didn’t explain his posts — which came a few days after Mahomes was embroiled in another internet controversy. Some Twitter users questioned if Mahomes’ message was a reaction after he didn’t appear to be invited to his brother’s bachelor party, which took place last weekend in Las Vegas. The younger Mahomes wasn’t seen in any photos from the celebratory weekend. The Super Bowl champion quarterback shut down a report last month that claimed he had a sit-down with his brother and fiancée, Brittany Matthews about their headline-grabbing antics last season. Last week, Mahomes was called out by a business on TikTok for allegedly scamming the company. That came after Mahomes was ripped by a Kansas City bar, which claimed in a December social media post that he acted entitled and was rude to staffers at the establishment. Mahomes, along with soon-to-be sister-in-law Brittany Matthews, made headlines throughout the 2021-22 NFL season for a number of viral situations. Last September, Mahomes poured water on Ravens fans for taunting him. The next month, he apologized after facing backlash for dancing on the late Sean Taylor’s logo during a memorial game in Washington. Matthews was also criticized for walking on the logo.
