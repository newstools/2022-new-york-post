Hollywood is ready for its closeup. The 94th Oscars kicked off — on an eye-popping, futuristic stage — from Los Angeles’ Dolby Theatre at 8 p.m. Sunday, March 27, on ABC. And, for the first time since 2018, the awards show is led by a host — actually, make that three, with Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall in the house. It marks the first time three women have ever hosted the ceremony. The funny trio kept things topical in their opening group monologue, suggesting that the coronavirus pandemic has been rough on everyone, especially 26-year-old Timothée Chalamet — before cutting to a closeup of 67-year-old Oscar winner J.K. Simmons. They also predicted a fun night for everyone — but an especially “gay night” for residents of Florida — a slap to the recent dustup over legislation there. In the top categories, Jessica Chastain (“The Eyes of Tammy Faye)”), Olivia Colman (“The Lost Daughter”), Penelope Cruz (“Parallel Mothers”), Nicole Kidman (“Being the Ricardos”) and Kristen Stewart (“Spencer”) are all vying for the Actress in a Leading Role statue, while Javier Bardem (“Being the Ricardos”), Benedict Cumberbatch (“The Power of the Dog”), Andrew Garfield (“Tick, Tick… Boom!”), Will Smith (“King Richard”) and Denzel Washington (“The Tragedy of Macbeth”) are in a race for Actor in a Leading Role. Meanwhile, the whopping 10 films in the running for Best Picture include “Belfast,” “CODA,” “Don’t Look Up,” “Drive My Car,” “Dune,” “King Richard,” “Licorice Pizza,” “Nightmare Alley,” “The Power of the Dog” and “West Side Story.” The full list of Academy Award winners and nominees — plus highlights (and lowlights) from the show — will be updated throughout the night.
