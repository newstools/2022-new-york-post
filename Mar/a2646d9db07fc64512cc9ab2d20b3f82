The mom, from Scotland, often shares pictures of her and her daughters’ glamorous outfits on her Instagram account, louiseyoung1975. And Louise’s good looks have left many users in shock. Despite the age gap, she is often mistaken for her children’s sister. Louise has eight daughters with her husband, three of whom are now married. Although Louise is often posting glamorous photos of herself and her family, she’s still a mom of eight and has to get on with the housework like the rest of us.

People praised her in the comments as a “wonder woman” for her upbeat energy, stunning looks, and for being a great mom. The mom has been inundated with people commenting on how young she looks. Not only that, Paris Fury — wife of boxer Tyson Fury — even showed her love, reposting the picture of Louise working out with her daughters. Paris wrote: “Seriously goals right there. This is a mother with three of her eight daughters working out. #femaleempowerment.” Many thought Louise was her daughters’ sister, not mom, one wrote, “I’m trying to work out who mom was … Goals right there!” “Wow what a woman you look so young to have a big family, love to have your energy.” Added another user.
