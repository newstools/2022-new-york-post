Daniel Faalele, a prospective NFL offensive tackle who played at Minnesota, is an enormous human being. Even by the standards of NFL offensive linemen, who are characteristically enormous human beings, Faalele’s girth stands out. According to the NFL’s research department, Faalele measured at 6-foot-8 and 384 pounds at the 2022 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. Faalele, 22, is the heaviest player at the NFL Scouting Combine since 2003  — by a whopping 15 pounds. He would be the second heaviest player in NFL history, behind Char-ron Dorsey, a former tackle for the Cowboys and Texans, who once weighed in at 388 pounds. However, 384 pounds is actually not even close to the largest Faalele has ever been. He told reporters earlier this week he weighed in at 426 pounds when he reported to Minnesota. The Melbourne, Aus. native also has a gargantuan wingspan. At the combine, he went to put the bench press bar down but wound up going over the top of where it was supposed to go because his arms are  so long. “I ain’t ever seen that,” a Vikings strength coach said. A number of recent mock drafts have projected Faalele, who only began playing football in 2016, as a first-round pick.
