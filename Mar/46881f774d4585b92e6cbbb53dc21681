A total of 19 children and two adults were in the classroom at the time of the crash. The sheriff’s department said that 14 of the children were transported to the hospital along with one staff member. Five of the children were taken to the hospital by their parents, USA Today reported. A Drug Recognition Expert from the department determined that the driver was “impaired” at the time of the crash.
