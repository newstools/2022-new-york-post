A Bronx couple is accused of stabbing to death their roommate after he turned on music to drown out their fighting early Friday, according to cops and police sources. The 29-year-old victim told the couple – a 21-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman – to keep it down when he heard them arguing around 3 a.m. inside the apartment on Perry Avenue near East 205th Street in Norwood, police sources said. At some point, the victim turned on some music to compete with the couple’s shouting, according to the sources. That sent the couple into a rage – and they stabbed the victim in the neck and chest, cops and the sources said. Responding officers found the victim unconscious and unresponsive, and he was pronounced dead on scene by EMS, police said. His name was not immediately released, pending family notification. The couple was taken into custody with charges pending, cops said.
