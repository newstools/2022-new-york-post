So a weekend with 29 shootings led Mayor Eric Adams to call his police commissioner and chief of department to City Hall for a reaming-out Tuesday, prompting major redeployments in a de facto revival of the “broken windows” policing abandoned in the de Blasio years. Adams is furious and frustrated: Good, we are too. The mayor took office Jan. 1, having won on promises to get crime under control, but it’s still rising. Time for dramatic action. Now Chief of Department Kenneth Corey has ordered 100-plus top supervisors to stop the bleeding by putting extra cops on patrol “to engage with quality-of-life infractions and criminals,” a Brooklyn supervisor told The Post. The Blas-created “neighborhood coordination officers” will shift from helping solve cases to quality-of-life enforcement, along with other redeployments to put hundreds more police on the streets. Yay! In high-crime precincts, the new anti-gun units will work 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. shifts. Excellent. “We’re going back to what works. This is exciting times,” says another police source. We don’t care what they call it, but “back to what works” is long overdue.
