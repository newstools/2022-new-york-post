Jonah Hill is the latest in a fleet of celebrities to say goodbye to New York City. The actor, 38, has put his Manhattan loft up for sale for almost $11 million — $1.83 million more than he paid for it in 2015, The Post can report. Initially buying the Noho neighborhood pad to upgrade from his previous 2,000-square-foot loft in Soho, the four-bedroom, four-bathroom 3,280-square-foot residence hit the market last week. In 2019 and 2020, the loft glided on and off the rental market for $37,500 per month. The official move to sell the Big Apple pad comes after “The Wolf of Wall Street” actor has been spending most of his days in the Hawaiian Island of Kauai with girlfriend, Sarah Brady. The two have been linked since August. Located at The Schumacher pre-war building, the home has since been converted into an expansive three-bedroom. Features include soaring 12 feet exposed brick barrel vaulted ceilings (the highest ceilings in the building), oversize arched wood-frame windows, white-oak floors and blackened-steel accents. “This apartment includes today’s most advanced smart home technology,” the listing notes. The living room comes with a large custom-made projector and screen for a movie theater effect. Adjacent is a chef’s kitchen with Calacatta marble countertops and stone island with marble waterfall. Features of the primary suite include soaring brick, barrel-vaulted ceilings, four large windows overlooking a lush courtyard garden by the famed Ken Smith, who is known for his work designing the MoMA roof gardens. “The entire home has been outfitted with state-of-the-art audio/video in-wall and invisible speakers, all controlled by a Crestron system linked to a tablet or phone for convenience,” the listing adds. “Automatic shades are installed in each room.” Building amenities include 24/7 doorman concierge, fitness center, children’s playroom, and a roof deck.
