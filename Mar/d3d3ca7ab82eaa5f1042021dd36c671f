Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to city streets across the globe, including in occupied Ukraine, to protest Russia’s military aggression Saturday. In Kherson, the first city to fall to the Russians on March 2, thousands of people engaged in peaceful demonstrations against the occupying force. “Peaceful demonstrations broke out in Courageous Kherson inspires Ukraine and the world!” tweeted Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs. “Thousands of peaceful Ukrainians protest Russian occupation in front of armed Russian soldiers. What a spirit. I call on everyone around the globe: express your support for the fearless Ukrainians in Kherson!” More than 30,000 people marched in the German city of Hamburg, some carrying signs in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag that read “I’m with Ukraine.” Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage. At the Place de Republique in Paris, thousands of demonstrators demanded that NATO establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine — an action that the alliance has so far shied away from carrying out. In Tel Aviv, hundreds of protestors blocked city streets. They carried Ukrainian flags as they called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion.
