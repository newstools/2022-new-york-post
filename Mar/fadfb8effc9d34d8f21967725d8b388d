Olivia Culpo is missing her two biggest fans. Taking to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star, 29, expressed that she “can’t wait” to reunite with boyfriend Christian McCaffrey and their adorable pup, Oliver Sprinkles, as she’s currently overseas for Paris Fashion Week. “Can’t wait to be reunited with these two soon!!!!” Culpo captioned a photo of herself kissing the Panthers running back, 25, while holding their furry friend. Culpo continued to gush over her two favorite guys, adding, “Can you handle the cuteness,” in a separate post. She then remarked, “and hotness?!?” over a solo shot of McCaffrey emerging from the water. Culpo and McCaffrey have been dating for more than two years. Recently, a source told Entertainment Tonight how the couple has “talked about getting engaged.” “They have been thinking about taking their relationship to the next level and have talked about getting engaged,” the insider said in February. “Christian is really close with Olivia’s family and her sisters love him.” McCaffrey, whose fifth NFL season was cut short in November due to injury, recently vacationed with Culpo’s family in Mexico. The model’s younger sister, Sophia Culpo, was present for the getaway, as well as her boyfriend, Jets receiver and soon-to-be free agent Braxton Berrios. With the new league year slated to begin March 16, the rumor mill is already churning about McCaffrey’s future. On Monday, CBS Sports reported that the Panthers have “fielded more than one call” for the Pro Bowler. Carolina is said to be looking for a first-round pick, as well as “another piece of compensation” for McCaffrey, whom they signed to a four-year, $64 million extension in April 2020. McCaffrey was selected by the Panthers in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft with the eighth overall pick.
