President Biden drew cheers from both sides of the aisle by condemning the “Defund the police” movement during his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night. “We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police, the answer is to fund the police,” Biden said to a standing ovation. “Fund with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.” The president mentioned slain NYPD officers Jason Rivera, 22, and Wilbert Mora, 27, who were gunned down last month as they responded to a domestic call in Harlem. Biden met with the families of the fallen cops during his visit to the Big Apple days after their funerals. “I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves,” the president said in his address. “I know what works: Investing in crime prevention,” Biden said. He also highlighted moves by the Justice Department requiring body cameras, banning chokeholds, and restricting no-knock warrants for federal law enforcement. And Biden got more applause as he touted his American Rescue Plan, saying it “provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.” “I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe,” he said.
