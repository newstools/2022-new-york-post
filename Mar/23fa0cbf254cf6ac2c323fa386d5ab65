Bronx drill rapper Dougie B was taken away in cuffs Thursday afternoon outside of Bronx criminal court after an argument in the parking lot, police sources said. The rapper, who a day earlier had filmed a music video with Cardi B, was arrested on undisclosed charges outside of Bronx Supreme Court following a commotion in the E. 161st St. parking lot, according to police. Cops believe there was some sort of car collision and shots were fired at one point but no one was injured, according to sources. Dougie B, whose real name is  Arion Howard, was due in court Thursday afternoon on an unrelated shooting case. A woman who told The Post she witnessed the argument said a “group of guys were arguing and all of a sudden I heard a gunshot.” “So crazy because right in front of the Bronx Supreme Court?” she said. “What did they think was going to happen? They weren’t getting away.”
