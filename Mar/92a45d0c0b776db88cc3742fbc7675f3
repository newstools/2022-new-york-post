Design maestros Whitney Robinson, Elle Decor’s former editor-in-chief, and his husband, Marc Karimzadeh, editorial director for the Council of Fashion Designers of America, have just listed their lavishly renovated, colorful condo at 181 E. 90th St. for $1.65 million. (They bought the home for $1 million in 2014, then shelled out $400,000 on renovations.) The Carnegie Hill building, known as the Metropolitan, launched in 2004 and was one of the final commissions of legendary architect Philip Johnson. At 1,100 square feet, the one-bedroom, two-bath unit is straight out of the glossy pages of a shelter magazine. A formal entry features Fromental wallpaper, while the living room boasts hand-painted lacquered walls by Augustin Hurtado, custom oak bookcases, a faux fireplace, hardwood floors and windows overlooking townhouse gardens. The large bedroom comes with bespoke closets and a spa-like bathroom that “instantly transports you to the Beverly Hills Hotel,” the listing (from mother-daughter team Wendy Sarasohn and Jamie S. Joseph of Brown Harris Stevens) notes. The design duo love the building so much that they’re now ensconced in a three-bedroom rental on a higher floor, with a terrace and Central Park views. Last July, Robinson and Karimzadeh got hitched at Park Avenue Synagogue. It was the first gay wedding held inside the conservative synagogue, with an over-the-top reception held at the Polo Bar.
