With MLB and the union ending the lockout, what’s next in baseball? Here are five things that will happen now that the barriers are cleared. There are still a few hundred. If history holds, about 60 will sign major league contracts and scores more will sign minor league deals. Carlos Correa and Freddie Freeman will be the highlight names, followed by a next tier such as Kris Bryant, Trevor Story, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber, not to mention Zack Greinke, Kenley Jansen and Clayton Kershaw. Talks had to be put on hiatus for the lockouts. But groundwork was done beforehand, and the key team to watch is Oakland. The A’s are expected to make large-scale moves, potentially involving their corner infielders Matt Chapman and Matt Olson, as well as their top three starters in Chris Bassit, Sean Manaea and Frankie Montas. There are roughly 125 cases that have to be settled or go to a hearing. The biggest names and dollars are likely to flow to the Yankees’ Aaron Judge, the Nationals’ Juan Soto and the Dodgers’ Trea Turner. Teams were not allowed to oversee any rehabilitations during the lockout. Thus, clubs will have to acquaint themselves with where each of their injury-rehabbing players are and what they have been physically up to. This will be trickiest for those coming from foreign countries, particularly those who did not work with their teams and do the legwork necessary to set up a visa prior to the lockout.
