It’s no mystery why a well-heeled anonymous buyer spent big on this historic Upper West Side pile. It’s huge. The six-story, 20-foot-wide, 10,000-square-foot Queen Anne-style mansion at 248 Central Park West just sold for $26 million. That’s less than its $30 million ask — but still an Upper West Side townhouse record. Sources say that the buyer is “a New York family.” Built by developer William Noble in 1887, today the renovated spread has its own heated lap pool, as well as six bedrooms, high ceilings, oversize windows, two skylights, four Juliet balconies with wrought-iron balustrades, a landscaped garden and a landscaped roof-deck overlooking Central Park. Other details include a grand staircase, an elevator, five decorative marble fireplace mantels, decorative ceilings, parquet floors, a chef’s kitchen, a full-floor main bedroom, and two floors of “formal entertaining” spaces. In the basement, there’s an 1,875-square-foot “wellness center” with a lap pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and hydrotherapy steam shower. The limestone and brick facade boasts bas-relief sandstone carvings, balcony grills and a wrought-iron entrance gate. There’s even a limestone fountain in the garden “inspired” by Central Park’s Bethesda Fountain, notes the listing from Corcoran’s Ileana Lopez-Balboa and Deanna Kory. Compass broker Charlie Attias repped the buyer.
