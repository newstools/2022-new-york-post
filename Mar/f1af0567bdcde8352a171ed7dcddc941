It’s freedom fries, part deux. A Canadian diner temporarily renamed poutine in order to show support for Ukraine after Russia invaded it. Poutine is a popular Canadian specialty of French fries and cheese curds, topped with brown gravy. When said out loud, it sounds similar to Putin — the Russian president’s last name. Le Roy Jucep, which has touted that it invented poutine, wrote in a Feb. 24 Facebook post that it was changing the name to “la frite fromage sauce” — the fry cheese gravy. The post also revealed “a revised logo sporting Ukrainian blue and yellow,” Eater Montreal reported. The backlash was swift for the restaurant and it removed the post after it was reported that they received death threats. Since the invasion, liquor stores in both the United States and Canada have removed Russian vodka from their shelves. In New York City, people have flocked to the East Village’s Ukrainian diner, Veselka, to show support, while Midtown’s Russian Tea Room has seen less customers. After the well-known diner received media attention, it posted: “Very touching to learn that our tiny message of support has been sent from Drummondville all the way to Ukraine! If we could make someone smile there, that’s already a win! We are with you from the bottom of our hearts.”
