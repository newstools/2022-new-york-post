The Peacocks’ dancing days may be over, but Saint Peter’s biggest fans have nothing but love for the beloved Cinderella squad of March Madness. Shortly after North Carolina defeated Saint Peter’s in the Elite Eight on Sunday — with the Tar Heels advancing to this year’s Final Four —Doug Edert’s girlfriend, Olyvia Smith, congratulated the Jersey City team for taking the country by storm. “Supa proud @dougedert25 and @d.b.iii,” Smith posted to her Instagram Story, celebrating both Edert and Saint Peter’s point guard Daryl Banks III for making the East Region’s All-Tournament Team. Smith, who is a softball player at Saint Peter’s, also posted a photo of herself holding a cutout of Edert’s face from Sunday’s game, per Side Action. The Peacocks made history during this year’s NCAA tournament, becoming the first 15th seed to ever reach the Elite Eight following their win Friday against No. 3 seed Purdue. Edert, a junior guard who hails from Nutley, New Jersey, had become a fan favorite during the team’s run and even climbed onto the scorer’s table to celebrate the Peacock’s victory over Purdue. “I found a little opening and people started moving stuff, so I don’t know. I was so excited,” he said at the time. Throughout the tournament, Smith has shown her support for Edert and the Peacocks on Twitter, including the moment Saint Peter’s took down No. 2 seed Kentucky when the tournament first began. Although it’s unclear when the couple began dating, Edert posted photos of the pair to his Instagram page in August, when he celebrated Smith’s birthday.
