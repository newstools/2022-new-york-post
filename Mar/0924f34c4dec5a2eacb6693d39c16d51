Beth Stelzer isn’t a swimmer, she’s an amateur powerlifter. But she’s been at the McAuley Aquatic Center in Atlanta for the past three days protesting controversial transgender swimmer Lia Thomas‘ presence at the NCAA swimming championships. Thomas finished the 500-yard freestyle in 4 minutes, 33.24 seconds Thursday night to become the first known transgender athlete to win a Division I national championship in any sport. Stelzer, 37, has been joined in Atlanta by women from all over the country who are part of Save Women’s Sports, a group she says fights for biological sex-based eligibility for female sports. The group is part of a growing backlash against transgender athletes like Thomas. “This is not an anti-Lia campaign,” Stelzer told The Post. “It’s a pro-woman campaign. We think everyone should play sports fairly.” Stelzer said while Save Women’s Sports has members from all over the political spectrum, she said many were former lifelong Democrats disillusioned by what she called the “radical ideology” of the Democratic Party. Amy Sousa, who protested alongside Stelzer and others against Thomas in Atlanta, told Fox News she is “a lifelong registered Democrat who ultimately feels politically homeless” because the Democratic Party no longer “represents my beliefs or my views.” “We came down here to support the female athletes,” Stelzer told The Post. “Our intention was to respectfully raise awareness while letting the girls know they matter and that we will hold the line for them.” Stelzer formed the group, she said, after JayCee Cooper, a transgender woman, tried to join the 2019 USA Powerlifting Women’s State Championship, which Stelzer was also competing in. “I’m just an average American mom and I thought it was a joke at first,” Stelzer said.“It threw me down a rabbit hole of what turned out to be the erasure of women in sports.”
