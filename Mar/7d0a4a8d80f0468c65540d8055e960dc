A new computer tool can spot heart disease in 20 seconds, a study found — nearly 40 times faster than experienced medics. It uses artificial intelligence to read complex MRI scans in record time and does so more accurately than humans. Doctors are alerted to potential heart problems before the patient is even out of the scanner. Until now, specialists would spend an average of 13 minutes examining final MRI images. With 120,000 cardiac scans conducted each year, the British Heart Foundation claims the “revolutionary” tool will free up medics to help tackle backlogs. It was developed by researchers at University College London and Barts Heart Centre. Their leader, consultant cardiologist Dr. Rhodri Davies, said: “Our new AI reads complex heart scans in record speed, analyzing the structure and function of a patient’s heart with more precision than ever before.” “The beauty of the technology is that it replaces the need for a doctor to spend countless hours analyzing the scans by hand.” The tool is being rolled out in London, with plans to expand its use to 40 more sites. The BHF funded the study, published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
