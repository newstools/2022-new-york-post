Aaron Rodgers got to be involved in a wedding after all. Despite splitting from former fiancée Shailene Woodley, Rodgers was near Santa Barbara on Saturday to officiate the wedding of Packers offensive lineman David Bakhtiari, per video obtained by TMZ. According to the gossip site, Rodgers was heavily involved in the affair, drinking and mingling with guests. ET also reported that the quarterback was spotted with Woodley at the event and she “lovingly patted his behind.” Interestingly, with Rodgers set to tell the Packers whether he wants to stay or go by Tuesday afternoon, according to NFL reporter Michael Silver, Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur was reportedly in attendance. Whether they crossed paths at all, we don’t know. NFL Network reported this weekend that Rodgers is “truly torn” and “going back and forth” on whether to leave the place he’s spent his entire career. Pro Football Talk reported that Rodgers has lined up the Broncos, Titans and Steelers as potential trade destinations, with deals in place, though ESPN has reported that Green Bay hasn’t yet gone through trade scenarios with Rodgers. The saga with Rodgers has been ongoing since the 2020 draft, when Green Bay unexpectedly took Jordan Love and set off speculation that Rodgers would soon be on his way out. Over two years, it’s built to a crescendo, with Rodgers becoming a lightning rod over the last season thanks to trade rumors and his refusal to be vaccinated. It looks now like this chapter will finally be coming to an end soon. Exactly how, though, is anyone’s guess.
