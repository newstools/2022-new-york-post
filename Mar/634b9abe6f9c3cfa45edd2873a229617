If you struggle when it comes to getting a good night’s sleep, chances are you’ve tried a fair few remedies to try and improve the quality of your slumber. But one expert has come up with a unique way of ensuring you have a satisfying snooze – and it involves putting an ice pack between the breasts. Alan Mendell, aka the Motivational Doc, took to TikTok to reveal the unusual hack, explaining that putting something cold on the torso helps activate the “vagus nerve”. “Which helps calm you down,” he added. “So take an ice pack and put it on your chest. “This will destress your body and send you off to sleep.” In writing over the top of the video, he explained “ice between the breasts puts you to sleep”. He also advised wrapping the ice pack in a cloth, to avoid any uncomfortable freeze burns, and use for up to 15 minutes. People quickly took to the comments section to have their say on Dr Mandell’s suggestion. “This helps my panic attacks and hot flashes 100%,” one person wrote. While another added: “I just started doing this in the last week and it works. “I have struggled getting to sleep since I was 12. Thank you.” “I love sleeping cold, I HATE being hot when i sleep. I’m trying this,” a third wrote. “I put an ice pack on my throat when I’m nauseous,” another comment read. Others insisted they were less than convinced by the hack, with one writing: “Did it 3 nights in a row…DID NOT WORK.” “doesn’t work for those who are always extremely cold,” someone else added.
