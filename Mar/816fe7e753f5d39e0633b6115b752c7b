Two women died and several people were injured after an elderly driver lost control of his car and crashed into an outdoor dining area in Washington, DC on Friday. The car plowed into diners outside of the Parthenon restaurant in the 5500 block of Connecticut Avenue shortly after noon, authorities said. Eight people were transported to area hospitals, five in life-threatening condition, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly told reporters. The two women who died were among those critically hurt, according to local reports. Their names were not immediately released. Three additional victims were treated for minor injuries on the scene. “All indications are that this was truly accidental,” DC Metro Police Commander Duncan Bedlion told reporters. Bedlion said the elderly driver had been alone in the car, and was cooperating with police. The commander added that the incident was under active investigation.
