Ivy League swimmers who complained about Lia Thomas were rebuked and told not to speak to the media, according to emails that were given to The Post by parents.This message was sent by Harvard coaches to swim team members, chastising them for “focusing [on] what is fair and what is ethical” — saying that’s wrong because Thomas has been following the NCAA rules.The note references Schuyler Bailar, who was a transgender male who competed for Harvard, darkly suggesting he wouldn’t be alive if he wasn’t supported by his team. “Life is more important than politics,” it lectures.Finally, the message tells the swimmers to stop being annoyed and “focus on our team,” saying if the media calls, “ideally, refrain from comment.”
