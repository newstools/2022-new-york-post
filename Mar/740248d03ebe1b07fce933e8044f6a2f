Disgraced ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo took to the pulpit Sunday not to beg forgiveness but preach fire and brimstone on the “political sharks” who supposedly drove him from office. He claimed to be “truly, truly sorry” and that he “learned a powerful lesson,” but only because he hadn’t “appreciated” changing norms in the workplace. He actually said his “behavior has been the same for 40 years in public life” (which suggests that dozens more women have ugly tales to tell), which turned out to be “the problem.” Among other things, this also means he’s still stonewalling on his deadly care-home orders, issued to protect a big-donating special interest at the expense of vulnerable elderly and special-needs New Yorkers. “I’ve gone through a difficult period the past few months. I resigned as governor, the press roasted me, my colleagues were ridiculed, my brother was fired,” Cuomo moaned. “It was ugly. It was probably the toughest time of my life.” Cry us a river! “God isn’t finished with me yet,” he insisted. Maybe not, but the voters are: Polling shows a majority believe the accusations, even if he’s escaped prosecution. In the Siena survey, 58% say they believe Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women as governor against just 21% who think him innocent. Cuomo’s spending big from the millions that special interests put in his political warchest in his salad days to try reversing those numbers. If he ever decides to try earning real redemption, he’ll donate that fortune to a genuinely good cause.
