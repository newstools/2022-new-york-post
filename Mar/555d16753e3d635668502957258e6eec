The casket carrying the body of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, who was found dead Friday at a hotel in Colombia, was seen being loaded onto the band’s plane for the somber flight back to the US, photos show. The chartered Boeing 757 took off from Bogota and landed in Los Angeles on Tuesday night, according to the Daily Mail, which published the images from the El Dorado International Airport. Gus Brandt, the tour manager, remained in Colombia after the other band members returned to the US a day after the 50-year-old musician was found dead at the Four Seasons Casa Medina, the outlet reported. On Tuesday, the Foo Fighters announced that they have canceled their remaining shows in light of the untimely death. “We’re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won’t be seeing one another as planned,” they said. “Instead, let’s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we’ve made together. With Love, Foo Fighters.” Hawkins was found unresponsive in his hotel room before the band was scheduled to play a show in Bogota on Friday. From there, they had planned dates throughout the Americas and Europe. He had reportedly complained of chest pains before going alone to his room. Medical authorities in Colombia have stated that Hawkins had apparently suffered from an enlarged heart muscle, possibly leading to cardiac arrest, and also reportedly harbored 10 different drugs in his system at the time of death. Forensic experts during an examination found Hawkins’ heart weighed “at least 600 grams,” double the average of 300 to 350 grams (three-quarters of a pound), the Daily Mail previously reported.
