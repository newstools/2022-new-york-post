This Instagram influencer is performing a different kind of guitar lick. Miami model Vvs Diamond, 27, has stunned social media users by sharing a video of herself seemingly playing an acoustic guitar with nothing but her tongue. The short clip, which was posted to her Instagram page late last month, shows the amateur musician holding the instrument up to her mouth to recite the well-known 20th Century Fox fanfare. In the video, Diamond quickly flicks her tongue across the strings of the guitar in order to play the famous tune. “Tag a friend to annoy them,” the model humorously wrote beneath the clip, which has now been viewed more than 2 million times on Instagram and 202,000 times on TikTok. Viewers quickly flocked to the comments section awed by Diamond’s musical abilities. “That tongue has a career!!!” a user exclaimed. Several men were so enamored by Diamond’s mouth movements that they even asked for her hand in marriage. “WILL YOU MARRY ME?!!!” one male wrote, using all caps to express his enthusiasm. “Sorry brother, but she gonna marry me first,” another man quickly replied. And while Diamond’s performance garnered both praise and proposals, others were left somewhat disgusted. “Gross.. guitar strings are covered in bacteria!” one critic railed, noting that Diamond was inside a guitar shop seemingly playing an instrument that did not belong to her. Others questioned the authenticity of Diamond’s daring musical abilities, with a skeptic stating: “Fake! Her fingers aren’t moving to different frets and her tongue isn’t strumming enough strings to generate the chords we hear.” Diamond has not yet shared any other music videos playing the guitar with her tongue, prompting further speculation the clip was nothing more than a manufactured stunt. The Post has reached out to Diamond for comment.
