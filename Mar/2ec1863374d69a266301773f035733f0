Mayor Eric Adams just put a major asterisk on his COVID slam dunk. While announcing Sunday the likely end of indoor mask and vaccine mandates in New York City (including, hallelujah, in schools), Adams said he’s sticking with one of the worst policies he inherited from the last guy. Namely, the mandate requiring all city private-sector employees to get jabbed to come to their workplace. This is the rule that keeps Nets point guard Kyrie Irving from playing home games, even as unvaxxed away players rotate through Barclays and the Garden weekly. Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered this in December to stop Omicron. Yet it did absolutely nothing: Omicron cases in the city shot up, peaked and receded exactly as they did everywhere else. The mandate made literally no difference. Per Mayo Clinic data, mandate-allergic Florida saw about 347 average daily cases per 100,000 people at its Omicron peak. New York hit 366. Florida’s fatality rate reached 1.2%; New York’s, 1.4%. With rare exceptions, mandates don’t significantly affect COVID outcomes. Period. Adams knows this. We all do, with two years of COVID data to look at. That’s why he’s rolling back most rules. Yet the mayor said Monday that letting Kyrie play would “send the wrong message,” echoing his earlier claim that lifting the vax mandate might send “mixed messages.” Yet now it’s keeping this rule that mixes up the message. Free Kyrie, Mr. Mayor, and every other unvaccinated private-sector worker. Tell the whole town it’s time to let go of COVID fears.
