In 1994-95, Fred McGriff was both power hitter and iron man. He hit the ninth-most homers in the majors during those two years combined, and he played in all but one of the Braves’ 258 games. But it was 258 games rather than the standard 324 because of labor interruptions to the 1994 and 1995 seasons. McGriff played every day, so he left as many as 66 games on the table. If he stayed at his pace as one of the mightiest bats of the era, he would have hit an additional 15 homers. Few truly can understand baseball-induced labor pains like McGriff can. He hit 493 home runs for his terrific career. Without those labor stoppages in 1994-95, it is hard to imagine he would not have hit seven more homers to reach 500. Would 500 have been the magic number to nudge McGriff from a strong candidate to a Hall of Famer?
