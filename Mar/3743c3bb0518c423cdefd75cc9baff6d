The head coach of a New Mexico college men’s and women’s golf program was killed in a head-on collision between the school’s van and a pickup truck in Texas — as several other victims, including students, still have not yet been identified, according to local reports. Tyler James, who was entering his first season as head coach at the University of the Southwest in Hobbs, was killed when the private school’s vehicle collided head-on with a Ford F-150 on SH 115 and 1788 about 8:15 p.m. Tuesday, KWES-TV reported. Several others were believed to have also died in the accident on the two-lane road about nine miles from the city of Andrews. “We are still learning the details about the accident but we are devastated and deeply saddened to learn about the loss of our students’ lives and their coach,” university president Quint Thurman said in a statement, NBC News reported. “My understanding is that two of our students have survived and have been airlifted to University Hospital in Lubbock with serious injuries,” Thurman said. “We would ask for prayers for their recovery and for comfort and strength for all of families and friends and students of those whose lives have been lost.” It was unclear how many people were in either vehicle. Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Steven Blanco said there were deaths in both vehicles, which caught fire. “Both suffered extremely heavy damage,” Blanco said, according to NBC News. He said at the scene that the van was transporting the teams from a tournament in West Texas, KWES reported. On its website, the Christian school listed events for both teams at Midland College on Tuesday.
