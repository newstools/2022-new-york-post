With a loaded slate of conference tournament action Thursday, BJ Cunningham of The Action Network is here to share his best bets (video above). The first contest Cunningham is targeting comes in the ACC Tournament as favored Virginia Tech gets set to face Notre Dame. For Cunningham, he sees value to be had on an “underrated” Hokies squad. “[Virginia Tech] plays an extremely slow pace, but they’re number one in points/possession in the half-court offense,” Cunningham says. “They’re also top-five in shot selection, spacing, and open three-point rate.” Given Notre Dame also plays a slow pace, is dead-last in the conference in offensive rebounding, and is below-average in free throw rate, Cunningham expects a solid performance from Virginia Tech as it seeks a tournament spot. The second contest Cunningham is targeting on Thursday is a Big 12 conference tournament matchup between Texas Tech and Iowa State. Given the atrocities associated with Iowa State’s offense – second-to-last in offensive efficiency, dead-last in offensive rebounding percentage, and free-throw rate – Cunningham believes this is a good spot for the favorites.  “Texas Tech is the number one defense in college basketball,” Cunningham explains. “They are [also] number one in the country in points per possession allowed in half-court defense.” In order to have a chance at beating the Red Raiders, Cunningham believes teams need to hit a lot of three-point shots or crash the offensive boards. Given Iowa State does neither well, Cunningham is willing to lay seven-and-a-half points with Texas Tech.
