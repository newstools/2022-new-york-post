Gov. Kathy Hochul has a running-mate problem: Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin played fast and loose with the state Senate’s per diem and travel reimbursement system as well as state campaign-finance regs. Times Union investigators found 12 instances where the then-state senator used his campaign’s credit card on trips for which he also got taxpayer-funded reimbursements for his expenses. His per diem records and campaign filings confirm the double-dipping. State law says submitting faked reimbursement vouchers “may be a felony or misdemeanor offense.” (Senate forms don’t carry that explicit warning, but the Assembly’s travel voucher plainly says so.) It’s meant criminal cases against other legislators. Raising state legislators’ pay to more than $100,000 was supposed to put an end to those kinds of abuses. Ha! Even if Benjamin pleads incompetence, rather than arrogance, in submitting his false claims, he’s at least a liar: As Team Hochul vetted him for his current post, he stated on a State Police background check form that he’d never been contacted by a “regulatory body” over a possible campaign-finance violation or investigation — when both the state Board of Elections and the city Campaign Finance Board were investigating his campaigns. Benjamin only repaid his campaign after media inquiries exposed him. If Hochul decides to keep Benjamin as her No. 2, including on this year’s ballot, she’d better explain why his ethical breaches don’t matter.
