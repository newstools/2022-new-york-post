Doug Edert and his glorious mustache have to be here. The Saint Peter’s guard has signed an NIL deal with Buffalo Wild Wings, he announced on his Instagram page. He is promoting a campaign where fans get six free boneless wings if one of the remaining NCAA Tournament games goes to overtime. Edert is a busy man in the NIL space, as he’s also launched a “Dougie Buckets” apparel collection with Barstool Sports. Edert, a junior, scored 20 points in Saint Peter’s shocking overtime victory over Kentucky in the first round, and added 13 as the Peacocks defeated Murray State on Saturday to reach the Sweet 16. NIL is new to college sports in the last year and has provided college athletes like Edert with opportunities to capitalize on their name, image and likeness while in the limelight. Edert has alternately gained attention for being a sharpshooter, and for his throwback mustache. “Once people started calling him a ’70s porn star, calling him Ted Lasso, he’s like, ‘All right, just bring it, let’s go,’ ” Edert’s father, Bill, told The Post last week. “He called me and said, ‘There are kids at Saint Peter’s with mustaches on their face, what is going on?’ I’m like, ‘What’s going on? This is what you did. You created this.’ “Most people have a little bit of fear about what people think of them. He’s out there with that crazy hair and that mustache right now just doing his thing. That’s who he is. He almost reminds me of Will Ferrell.’’ For his part, Edert laughed his father’s words off. “It’s just my personality,’’ Edert said. “The way I grew up, I didn’t really care what people thought about me, and I try to embrace it so when I’m on the court I try to do my own thing. It helps me stay relaxed.’’
