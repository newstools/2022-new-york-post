Expect the unexpected they say when it comes to March Madness. With brackets busted by upsets and game winners, any college basketball fan would tell you that’s just the norm. But fans were not expecting to see one of NFL’s greatest wide receivers Terrell Owens shaking pompoms with cheerleaders while rooting for the Chattanooga men’s basketball team, reported by Philadelphia Inquirer. Owens made a surprise visit at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh to support his alma mater Chattanooga, as they took on Illinois in a first round March Madness matchup. Footage on Twitter captures the Hall of Fame wideout in school spirit, shaking a pair of pompoms in unison with the Chattanooga Mocs’ cheerleaders on the sidelines. It was a true Owens’ moment that flash-backed to when he waved a pair of pompoms during a touchdown celebration in his San Francisco 49ers days. But the cheerleading show was more of a bitter-sweet moment, as Chattanooga would end up losing to Illinois, 54-53, in a thrilling March Madness first round matchup. Owens attended Chattanooga from 1993-96. While at the university, the six-time Pro Bowler played football, basketball, and ran track. From there on, he was drafted into the NFL as a third round pick by the San Francisco 49ers.
