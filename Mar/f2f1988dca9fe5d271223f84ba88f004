Sharing your Amazon account with a partner or your family can have its benefits but there are some downsides. One of the biggest is that other people will be able to see what you’ve ordered on the account. This is a big issue if you want to order a secret present or you’re trying to hide your spending habits. Don’t worry though, as there’s a way to hide your Amazon purchases on your account so Christmas and birthday presents aren’t ruined. First, log in to your Amazon account and then click on “Returns & Orders” in the top right corner. Here you’ll see a list of what you’ve ordered over the past three months. You need to scroll through this list to find the item you want to hide. You can also search for the item in the search bar. Then, click “View Order Details”. Next, click “Archive Order” twice when the option appears. Whatever you ordered at the same time as the item will also be archived. This removes the item from your orders list. It’s still technically viewable in archives though. You’d have to find it on the less obvious Amazon Archived Orders page. If you’re still worried, you could set up an Amazon Household account. This will let you and your partner have separate account pages but the same payment method and address. Up to four teens and kids can also be added to an Amazon Household account. You may also want to stop an Amazon Alexa speaker from ruining your purchasing fun. You can also stop your Amazon account from letting your smart speaker know what you’ve ordered. Open the Alexa app on your phone and go to “Settings”. Find “Notifications” and then click “Amazon Shopping”. Find the section that says “Say or Show Item Titles” and then turn this off. Now Alexa can tell you when a package is going to be delivered but it won’t say specifically what the package is so Christmas or a birthday won’t be ruined.
