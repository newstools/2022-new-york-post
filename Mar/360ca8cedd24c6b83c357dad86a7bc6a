Bertha, keep walkin.’ Grandma Droniak of TikTok fame has a few modest requests — or demands, rather — for her funeral. Droniak, whose full identity and location remain a mystery to most of her followers, is known for sharing sassy advice and news dispatches from her life as a single senior at 92. And some posts have drawn a whopping 15 million views or more. On Wednesday, the gran-fluencer shared all three of her offbeat funeral desires with her millions of followers on the platform. “These are my rules at my funeral,” Droniak begins in the new TikTok, which has drawn over 7 million views so far. She then exclaims: “Listen up!” In her caption, she added, “It wont be any time soon but don’t forget it.” Droniak’s succinct funeral directives were enthusiastically applauded by the thousands who commented on the video. “YES SLAY GRANDMA CAN I COME,” asked one reader. “OKAYYY SOUNDS FUN,” said another. However, the real question on everyone’s mind: Who is Bertha and what did she do to become Grandma Droniak? “WE NEED STORY TIME ON BERTHA PLEASE!!! WHO IS SHE AND WHY ISNT SHE INVITED!?” urged one follower, whose plea has garnered 39,000 supporters. “I’ll tell you about it soon,” Droniak promised one curious viewer. Until then, she’ll do as The Madrigals of Disney’s “Encanto” do: “We don’t talk about Bertha.”
