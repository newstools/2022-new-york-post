She had a case of the crabs. A tourist in Puerto Rico got a closer sea life encounter than intended after a crab infiltrated her ear while she was snorkeling in San Juan. A video detailing the crustacean invasion currently boasts 2.3 million views on TikTok. “Snorkeling in San Juan. A f–king crab yo,” reads the caption to the crabby clip, which was uploaded Sunday by user @wesdaisy. In the one-minute video, a doctor can be seen fishing around in the girl’s ear with a pair of tweezers before warning her that this “is gonna hurt.” After a minute of probing, the aural interloper finally scuttles out of the orifice like it’s a crevice at low tide, whereupon the doc tosses the critter on the pavement. The clip concludes with the camera zooming in on the crustacean as the shell-shocked TikTokker exclaims, “What is that?!” Her unconventional case of the crabs scared up quite a few reactions on the platform, with one gawker writing, “new fear unlocked.” “Did anyone else jump?” wondered another, while one jokester quipped, “thanks for the warning, earplugs when in the water while on vacation.” “The rest of the trip is canceled please get me the on the first flight the hell up outta here!” said one revolted viewer of the “This Came Out Of Me”-worthy ordeal. @wesdaisy replied, “My exact sentiments!!! Went kayaking the next day.” She deserves a spot in the pantheon of people who’ve gotten peculiar objects logged in unlikely places. Recent examples have included a man who had a cockroach infiltrate his ear while swimming to a teen who got a USB cable caught in his penis while trying to measure its length.
