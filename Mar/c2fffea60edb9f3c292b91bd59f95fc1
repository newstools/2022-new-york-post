Jomboy is coming to YES. Jomboy Media, founded by Yankees fan Jimmy O’Brien just four years ago, will have programming on the YES Network as well as a significant presence on the YES app this season. What could be an intriguing element is a “Jomboy Watch Party,” featuring O’Brien and his business partner, Jake Storiale, that would be featured on select games on the YES app. It is still being determined how this will be executed, but if you can watch the game, along with Jomboy Media and guests, it could have potential. David Cone will have a “Pitching Coach” series in which he, O’Brien and Storiale will explain how to play “Blitzball.” “Blitzball” is a backyard baseball game that allows players to use equipment that enables them to mimic the breaking action of big league pitchers. Besides being a YES and ESPN analyst, Cone does a podcast for Jomboy Media. The Cone podcast, “Toeing the Slab,” which is hosted with Justin Shackil and James Smyth, will have a 30-minute YES show that will feature its best segments. Jomboy’s “Talkin’ Yanks” pod will have a similar setup on YES and the app, with the “best of” half-hour setup. The terms of the deal are not known, but was described as a content and marketing partnership.
