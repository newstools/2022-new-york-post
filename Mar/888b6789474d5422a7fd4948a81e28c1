From the gym to the home office, every man needs a wardrobe stocked with tee shirts. We’re not talking about ratty college tees or worn cotton ones, either. We mean the durable, sweat-wicking and quick-drying kind perfect for spring and summer. Good thing we found these Amazon bestsellers, now in a five-pack for $26, which breaks down to just over $5 for a shirt. They are officially called Men’s Dry-Fit Moisture Wicking Active Athletic Performance Crew T-Shirt, sold by Real Essentials. The name is fitting, as the shirts come in essential colors like black, gray, blue, red and more, and the fit is essential for a fully-functional and fashionable man. Plus, the reviews would also agree that these are essential. They now have over 56,600 reviews on Amazon, with a 4.2-star average rating. As with any Amazon deal, we don’t know how long it will last, so we advise you to stock up on the tees now, making sure to check out each of the 14 different 5-packs. The all-white and all-black packs are great to have for everyday wear, while the others are great for mixing things up with other colors and patterns. No matter which you choose, each shirt is made of moisture-wicking and quick-drying fabric to keep you cool and comfortable while working out or hanging in the sun. Speaking of sun, they are also made with UPF 50+ protection, keeping harmful UV rays away. Whether you wear these as an undershirt to stay nice and dry or out and about for a put-together gym look, act fast, as this deal won’t last long. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
