This mind-bending brainteaser will tell you a lot about your personality, more specifically your most irritating trait. Take a look at the teaser below and work out what you see first, don’t overthink it – go with your gut. The bizarre picture features a merged image of a man reading a book, a tree and also a face. According to Your Tango, the image you identified first will tell you what your most annoying personality trait is. If the first thing you saw was a man’s face then it’s likely you speak without thinking. The most frustrating thing for people in this camp is that they say exactly what they’re thinking without stopping to reflect. You do have social skills but it seems that you don’t always know when to leave things unsaid. If the first thing you focused on was the man reading the book, you may well be a bit of a dreamer. People who saw the reader often prefer to retire away from others and enjoy their own company. This is no bad thing, except if you can slip into a fantasy world for long periods of time. If you zeroed straight in on the trees, you may struggle to take things as seriously as you should. For people in this group, you can probably be a little childish from time to time. This could even result in you staying in a job where you’re underpaid or staying in a relationship where you’re unhappy because you don’t want to do the adult thing and make a change.
