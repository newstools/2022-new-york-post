Seven youths have been charged with armed robbery for their alleged roles in the brazen daylight attack on the French film crew of “Lupin,” a Netflix series about a burglar. Last month, a gang of about 20 hooded thieves threw fireworks at the crew and made off with about $330,000 worth of equipment. Three of the accused robbers, who are between 13 and 21 years old, are being held in custody while four are under judicial supervision. Police are still searching more of the assailants, and have recovered some of the stolen equipment, Agence France-Presse reported Saturday. The crew, along with the series’ star, Omar Sy, were filming in the Pablo Picasso district of the Parisian suburb of Nanterre on a late February afternoon when they were attacked. Nobody in the cast or crew – including Sy – was injured. The show tells the tale of professional thief Assane Diop, who is played by Sy. The series was inspired by the fictional French master of disguise Arsène Lupin. Lupin is not the only high-profile Netflix production to be targeted by thieves this year. The day before the Paris heist, robbers in South Yorkshire in the UK stole more than 200 antique props from the set of “The Crown” TV series The two robberies are not believed to be connected.
