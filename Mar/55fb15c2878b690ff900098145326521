The Jets are bringing back the man they planned to have as their starting safety a year ago before an injury cost him most of the season. Lamarcus Joyner re-signed with the Jets on a one-year deal, according to his agent, Sunny Shah. The Jets signed Joyner last offseason to a one-year, $3 million deal, hoping to pair him with Marcus Maye as their starting safety tandem. The plan did not last long. Joyner suffered a torn tendon in his arm during the Week 1 loss to the Panthers. The injury required surgery and Joyner’s season was done after just nine defensive snaps. The Jets also re-signed another safety on Thursday, bringing back Will Parks on a one-year deal. The Jets claimed Parks off of waivers from the Dolphins in December and he ended up playing in the final three games of the season, starting two of them. Safety remains a position of need for the Jets, who are expected to part ways with free agent Marcus Maye. There has been plenty of speculation that they might draft Notre Dame safety Kyle Hamilton with the No. 4-overall pick. By bringing Joyner back, they have a veteran presence at the position with the 31-year-old Florida State product. Joyner has played for eight seasons, spending his first five with the Rams before going to the Raiders for two years prior to joining the Jets.
