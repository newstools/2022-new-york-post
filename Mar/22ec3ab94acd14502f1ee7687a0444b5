Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training on Sunday: There was some doubt whether Gleyber Torres would be in the lineup because his wife is due to give birth any day, according to Aaron Boone. Torres started, got a hit and a walk and went from first to third on a single to right by Isiah Kiner-Falefa in the second inning of the Yankees’ 8-7 loss to the Tigers at Steinbrenner Field. Roger Clemens’ son, Kody, is a third baseman in the Tigers’ organization and went 1-for-3 with an RBI. The 25-year-old spent most of last season at Triple-A Toledo. Anthony Volpe was in pinstripes for the first time, wearing No. 14 and made a nice play on a grounder to his right in the fifth. The shortstop prospect then made a strong throw to first. The Yankees host the Phillies at 1:05 p.m. at Steinbrenner Field with Jameson Taillon scheduled to make his first start of the spring, as his recovery from offseason ankle tendon surgery continues to be ahead of schedule.
