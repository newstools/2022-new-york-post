Dramatic video captures the moment a gunman opened fire outside a Brooklyn apartment building this week – seriously injuring a teen who cops said wasn’t the intended target. The 16-year-old was opening the entrance door to the building on Sterling Place near Rochester Avenue in Crown Heights just before 9 p.m. Monday when the gunman – joined by another male – approached the doorway, cops said. The gunman fired a single shot – aiming for someone else who is shown on the footage running into the building, police said. But instead of striking his target, the teen was shot once in the lower right chest, authorities said. He was rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center in critical but stable condition. Cops described him as “a bit uncooperative” with investigators. Both suspects fled after the shooting, which police described as gang-related. The alleged shooter was last seen wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, dark-colored pants and a dark-colored baseball hat. His alleged accomplice wore a black hooded sweatshirt with white writing on the back.
