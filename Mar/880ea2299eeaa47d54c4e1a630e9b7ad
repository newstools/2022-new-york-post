“Coda” star Troy Kotsur made history tonight at the 2022 Oscars. The 53-year-old has become the second deaf actor to win the Academy Award (and the first deaf man to ever take home the trophy). The actor scored a win for his role in the Apple TV+ drama on Sunday, March 27. Presenter Yuh-jung Youn held his statuette right next to him as he spoke to the crowd in sign language. “My dad, he was the best signer in our family. But he was in a car accident and became paralyzed from the neck down,” he said in his moving acceptance speech, noting that his father could no longer sign after that. “Dad, I learned so much from you. I’ll always love you. You are my hero.” Kotsur also thanked “all of the wonderful deaf theater stages” where he was able to develop his craft over the years. “This is dedicated to the deaf community, the CODA community and the disabled community; this is our moment!” he added. He also joked about a “CODA” cast visit to the White House. “I was planning on teaching them dirty sign language but [“CODA” co-star] Marlee Matlin told me to behave myself. So don’t worry, Marlee — I won’t drop any f-bombs in my speech today.” Follow the 2022 Oscars with our up-to-the-minute coverage:  “CODA” is a heartwarming story about a high school student who lives with her mom, dad and brother, all of whom are deaf. The cast of “CODA” — an acronym that stands for “child of deaf adults” — includes 56-year-old Matlin, who was the first deaf performer to be nominated and then to win an Oscar in a lead role for the 1986 movie “Children of a Lesser God.” Kotsur was congratulated virtually by “Marvel” actor Chris Evans just shortly after the win.
