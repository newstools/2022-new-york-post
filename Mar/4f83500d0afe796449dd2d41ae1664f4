The Falcons are acting quickly after failing to land quarterback Deshaun Watson. On Saturday, Atlanta re-signed their Swiss army knife offensive weapon Cordarrelle Patterson, NFL Network reported. Though the specifics of the contract are not yet clear, the four-time Pro Bowler also confirmed the development, tweeting “RISE THE F–KKKK upppppp!!!!” The Falcons had cleared significant cap space in pursuit of Watson, who instead chose to land with Cleveland on Friday. Retaining Patterson, who turned 31 on Friday and had previously expressed his desire to return to Atlanta, saying that he’d like to finish his career there, clearly was a top priority for the Falcons in the aftermath of the failed attempt to sign Watson, whose trade to the Browns commanded three first-round picks and netted Watson a whopping five-year deal for $230 million – all of which is fully guaranteed, an NFL record. The Falcons were ready to move on from the best quarterback in their franchise history, Matt Ryan, in pursuit of Watson, who still faces 22 civil lawsuits that allege sexual harassment. Ryan, a four-time Pro Bowler, is signed through the 2023 season, but the 36-year-old led the Falcons to just a 7-10 mark last season. With Watson off the market, it appears Ryan will stay put. Atlanta also would have likely fared far worse last season without Patterson, who emerged as a unique threat all over the field. He rushed for 618 yards and added 548 receiving yards, with another 434 yards through kick returns. He totaled 11 touchdowns and was an integral piece of the offense. The Falcons also brought in running back Damien Williams, who had been with the Bears, as a backup. After missing out on Watson, they appear to have money to spend.
