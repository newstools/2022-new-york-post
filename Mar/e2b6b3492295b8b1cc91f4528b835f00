All the world’s a stage, especially at this house, which has a set piece to prove it. A four-bedroom townhouse in Washington, DC’s Dupont Circle neighborhood has a unique offering: an authentic two-story relic from a 1970s stage set. “According to my client who works at [the theater company] Arena Stage, it’s from a 1977 production called ‘Gemini,’ ” broker Maxwell Rabin told The Post of the piece, which looks like a brick building façade and is installed in a corner of the 1827 S St. NW home. It was installed by its former owner, George de Vincent, who, according to his obit, “hitchhiked around the country, worked as a driver for a traveling carnival, was a featherweight boxer and went to jail for bank robbery.” He later became a photographer, loved the theater and was well connected in the DC art scene. He passed away in 2014, aged 94. “I guess he got his hands on this piece and had it installed in his home,” said Rabin, who found a charcoal sketch buried in the wood behind the set piece which confirms its 1970s-origin time frame. De Vincent reportedly used the piece as a photo backdrop for shoots at his home. Upon noticing the piece, many people think it’s “the face of another building,” the broker said. But, alas, it’s probably not long for this world. “If this contract holds it’ll probably be redeveloped into condos and [the set piece will] become a thing of the past very quickly,” as the new owners are unlikely to keep it, said Rabin. Another standout aspect of the address may also soon be erased: one of its four bathrooms, which is made from poured concrete and has a “Star Wars”-esq quality to it. “It looks like something from Tatooine,” said Rabin. Other more typical highlights of the over 4,000-square-foot home include a roof deck, a brick patio off the kitchen and a two-car parking in the back.
