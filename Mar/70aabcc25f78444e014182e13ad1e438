Cops have arrested a Queens man in connection to a mugging at a McDonald’s restaurant in Manhattan earlier this week, police said. Rasheed Osundairo, 30, was charged with robbery Tuesday evening after an off-duty cop spotted the alleged robber on the subway, according to cops and sources. Osundairo is accused of socking a 53-year-old man in the face as he was ordering at a self-service kiosk in the 7th Avenue fast-food joint around 7.30 a.m. on Monday. Surveillance footage released by police shows the 53-year-old scrambling to get up before his alleged attacker pushes him up against the counter and demands his wallet. The footage then shows the victim being thrown to the ground, kicked and robbed of his phone and wallet. Osundairo is being eyed in another robbery on the subway and has had nearly two dozen prior run-ins what the law, police sources said.
