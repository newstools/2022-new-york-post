Ukraine has killed another Russian general in a further “serious blow to the morale” of the invading forces, a government adviser said Wednesday. Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev died Tuesday during the storming of Ukraine’s most devastated city, Mariupol, according to Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko — who later posted a photo of the body. Mityaev would be at least the fourth general killed during the invasion, which Kremlin officials are reportedly calling a complete “clusterf–k.’’ Mityaev, 46, commanded the 150th Motorized Rifle Division and had fought in Syria, Gerashchenko said, saying his body was found with “the shoulder straps of a major general.” He was “one of the most promising and iconic Russian military leaders,” claimed Gerashchenko as he celebrated “the liquidation of the general.” “This is a serious blow to the morale of Russian commanders. And the huge success of the Heroes of Mariupol,” the Ukrainian official wrote. “Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol have been fighting in full encirclement for 15 days. Every day they endure terrible artillery and air attacks,” he said of the city that the Red Cross said now looks “apocalyptic.” Yet “in such difficult conditions, our soldiers find the opportunity to smash the enemy, and inflict terrible losses on the Russians, take prisoners every day, and destroy the enemy’s top command staff,” Gerashchenko said. President Volodymyr Zelensky also reported the death of another Russian general, without naming him. There was no confirmation from Russia. With Post wires
