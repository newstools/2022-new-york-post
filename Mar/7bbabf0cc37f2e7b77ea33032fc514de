Epic Games will donate its Fortnite proceeds earned from March 20 to April 3 toward humanitarian relief operations for the victims of war-torn Ukraine, the company announced. The announcement comes ahead of Fortnite’s Chapter 3, season 2 release set to launch on March 20. The American software developer reported all proceeds made in the two-week span would include “all real-money” purchases in the game itself including Fortnite Crew, in-game cosmetics and V-Bucks card, and battle passes. Though, Epic stated on their site “using V-Bucks in Fortnite will not be included as those are not real-money purchases.” Details regarding how fast the funds will be distributed to the various humanitarian groups in Ukraine were addressed. Epic noted they would not wait for the actual funds to come — considering it could take some time. Epic will log all transactions immediately and send the funds to the groups within days. Epic Games said the humanitarian aid will be sent to Direct Relief, United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) and The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). More organizations are expected to be added in the coming weeks, Epic said. Microsoft’s Xbox joined Epic in donating their Fortnite proceeds for additional aid to the victims in Ukraine, according to Epic. Epic Games suspended ties to Russia, though people were still granted access to its games.
