Whether you’re new to cooking and learning the ropes of how to use your air fryer or consider yourself a pro, looking into the best woks to create the perfect stir-fry at home, a solid cutting board is a kitchen necessity no matter how often you cook. Much like your tried-and-true charcuterie boards (which we love for entertaining, hosting and decorating), a good chopping block is ideal for all your kitchen needs before serving your finished bon-appetit meal on your favorite dinnerware sets. Cooking just got easier with our 10 favorite cutting board options for you to choose from. In tandem with your most cherished cookware sets and celebrity cookbooks (who doesn’t like to cook like Chrissy Teigen?), you’ll feel like a Master Chef, Gordon Ramsay would be proud of. For a unique, best-selling cutting board, try your hand at this two-toned slab of wood. This professional-style butcher block is durable, walnut-embossed and, with the included salt and pepper grinders, makes the perfect gift.

The American black walnut wood keeps your knives sharp, too, and the raised edge helps keep your produce and other cuttables in place while chopping away. Not to mention, we’re obsessed with the brand’s Always Pan ($145). Read our review here. With nearly 43,000 rave reviews, this three-pack of good-grip cutting boards is a steal for just $25.

There’ no other name than Williams Sonoma for bringing premium cooking gear into your household. Specifically, the End-Grain Cutting Board has a beautiful dark finish that’s hard not to love. Plus, its richly grained wood is prized for density and hardness. If you are all for the natural wood look, Williams Sonoma has a gorgeous Teak Cutting & Carving Board that’s fairly priced for your kitchen. It has that dipped edge that helps your food stay in place, too, a feature that’s well worth the snag. Sur La Table’s Maple Everyday Cutting Board is practical yet decorative. When not in use, it can be placed vertically alongside your backsplash to adorn your wood cabinets. Just shy of $50, it’s smart, simple and made of light wood. Who said cutting boards can’t be showpieces of their own? Pottery Barn has a luxe, thick option that’s beautiful for chopping and serving. Plus, the side handle is a nice touch for preparing and hosting. If a thick block is all your after, then BigKitchen’s Natural Bamboo Two-Tone Square Cutting Board is calling your name.
