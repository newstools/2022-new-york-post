The Giants on Friday added another offensive lineman, agreeing to terms on a one-year contract with Jamil Douglas, a well-traveled 30-year old who has familiarity with the new coaching staff. Douglas was with the Bills in 2021, spending most of that season on the practice squad.  This means he worked in Buffalo with Brian Daboll, the new Giants head coach, and Bobby Johnson, the new Giants offensive coordinator. Douglas was signed late last season by Washington and appeared in three games. A fourth round draft pick of the Dolphins in 2015 out of Arizona State, Douglas has also been with the Patriots, Falcons, Colts and Titans. His NFL resume consists of 50 games played, with 11 starts, lining up at guard and center. The Giants are doing what they can to restock the offensive line. They signed Mike Glowinski to start at right guard and Jon Feliciano to start at center. They also signed Matt Gono as a swing tackle. The only player returning from last season expected to start on the offensive line is left tackle Andrew Thomas.
