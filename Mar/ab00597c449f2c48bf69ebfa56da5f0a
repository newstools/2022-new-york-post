The Jets have plucked away an assistant from one of the NFL’s most aggressive teams last season to be their new game management coach. Head coach Robert Saleh has hired former Chargers offensive assistant Dan Shamash to be the Jets’ Situational Football/Game Management Coordinator, The Post’s Brian Costello reported Tuesday. Shamash replaces Matt Burke, who left the Jets after one season to become the Cardinals’ defensive line coach. A New York native with a background in analytics, Shamash spent the last five years with the Chargers. Last season under head coach Brandon Staley, the Chargers had the third-most fourth-down attempts in the NFL (34) and converted on an NFL-high 22 of them. Shamash, who overlapped with Saleh with the Jaguars from 2014-16, played football at Carnegie Mellon and later had brief stops with the Jets as a coaching assistant and consultant, according to his LinkedIn page.
