Wild video shows a pair of pigs fiercely fighting off a large black bear that climbed into their enclosure in Connecticut. The pigpen in New Milford looked more like a wrestling ring when the bear scaled a fence and began attacking one of the oinkers earlier this month. Ring security video obtained by NBC Connecticut showed a white pig named Mary pushing back against the bruin. Hammy, a black hog who had been inside of roofed shelter attached to the sty, then suddenly charges at the bear, backing it into a corner on its hind legs, the dramatic footage shows. After a few minutes, the embattled bear leaps out of the pen. Rebecca Shaw, who owns the therapy pigs, told the outlet she was proud of the plucky animals. “I am very proud of them because Hammy, the little one especially, he’s afraid of his own shadow and the way he came charging out when he seen Mary tussling with the bear,” Shaw said. “He was like ‘oh no, no way, get out.’ Shaw said an alarm typically goes off if there’s a disturbance in the backyard, but she did not hear it that evening. She only learned about the bear after hearing her son and brother yelling. She said the bear seemed “cute” at first on the security footage, tumbling around in the hay beside the pig pen — before it jumped the fence. “That’s when I realized that my pigs can defend themselves,” Shaw said, adding, “I thank God, again, because it could have ended very badly.”
