A man was shot dead during a broad-daylight fight in the Bronx Wednesday, cops said. The unidentified victim got into a dispute with the occupants of a blue van at East 172nd Street and Harrod Avenue in Soundview just before 3 p.m. when he suddenly flashed a knife, police said. Then, at least one person inside the van opened fire – striking him in the right shoulder, the right side of his chest, both arms, his left lower stomach and both legs, cops said. He was rushed to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. No arrests were immediately made, and the investigation was ongoing Thursday morning.
