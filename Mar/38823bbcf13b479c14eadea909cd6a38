A family feud between a woman and her dead sister’s kids got so bad, she allegedly stole her sibling’s ashes from a Queens funeral home, a lawsuit claims. The cruel deceit played out when the woman pretended to be her niece, and called Leahy-McDonald Funeral Home in Richmond Hill asking to have a young relative pick up the ashes of Mohie Mangru, 71, according to court papers. The facility released Mangru’s ashes, without confirming that the woman who called was actually Mangru’s daughter, a lawsuit claims. The daughter, Noressa Bethune, became suspicious when no one called her after her mom’s Feb. 28, 2021, funeral to retrieve the remains, she said in court papers. Bethune claims she was told “that only she would receive the death certificate and decedent’s ashes because she signed the contract” with the funeral home, according to a Queens Supreme Court lawsuit filed by Bethune and her siblings. She later learned another person had claimed the ashes — and spread them earlier this month at Rockaway Beach, according to a live Facebook video. Bethune and her aunt do not get along, said Bethune’s lawyer, Eric Rothstein, who said the aunt is the one who called the funeral home pretending to be Bethune, and is believed to have spread the ashes. Bethune and her siblings are not suing their aunt, Rothstein said. The funeral home says in a March 2 legal filing responding to Bethune’s claims that it’s not totally to blame for the mistake, which was “caused” by the dead woman’s children. A lawyer for the funeral home did not return a message seeking comment.
