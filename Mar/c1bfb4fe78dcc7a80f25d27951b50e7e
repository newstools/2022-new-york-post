The NYPD will add five more Neighborhood Safety Teams starting on Monday — a week after the first wave of the new anti-gun units hit the streets, The Post has learned. The units — composed of one sergeant and five uniformed police officers each – will be activated on March 21 in Manhattan’s 25th and 28th precincts; Brooklyn’s 69th precinct;  Queens’ 114 precinct; and Staten Island’s 120th precinct, according to an internal memo obtained by The Post. A previous memo said a safety team in the 25th precinct was expected to roll out this week as part of phase one. It’s not clear why the deployment was delayed. The units — a key pillar of Mayor Eric Adams’ crime-fighting plan — have been directed to schedule a roundtable discussion with “relevant community stakeholders” by March 29, according to the Friday memo. All team members must participate in the meetings. The first wave of Neighborhood Safety Teams began patrolling March 14 in 28 areas where shootings have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 168 officers were part of the initial rollout, with the remaining roughly 300 hundred to be added on a rolling basis as they complete their seven-day training, police officials said. The teams are tasked with taking guns off the streets — a similar mission to its predecessor, the anti-crime unit, which was disbanded under the last administration. In contrast to plainclothes anti-crime unit that was disbanded in 2020, the cops in the new units will be clearly marked as NYPD officers. The team members wear navy blue tactical pants, black boots or shoes with a polo shirt, quarter-zip sweatshirt or Neighborhood Safety vest that has “NYPD” written on the back and front, along with patches bearing the officer’s name, shield, rank and command, according to a memo. Cops have the option of wearing a baseball cap or knit hat with NYPD stitched in white, the memo adds.
