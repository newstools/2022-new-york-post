This property may be fungible, but it’s holding space for property that isn’t. A Bel Air mansion complete with amenities appealing in both the physical and virtual universe is set to hit the auction block next month, and is currently listed for $87.7 million. The Palazzo di Vista property offers not only scenic sights of this mortal realm — in this case, views of Los Angeles from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Channel Islands — but also “multi-sensory” access to virtual beauties, namely an “NFT art gallery” featuring seven indoor large-screen media displays and a rotatable 2-D laser project specifically designed for NFT artwork that “casts light in a rhombic-shape up to 1,650 square feet over the pool with misters.” The laser experience is meant to emulate Disney’s California Adventure Park’s World of Color attraction. Back to the corporeal domain, the new construction mansion has seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a glass elevator, koi pond, infinity-edge pool, marble slabs throughout the interior and exterior and a “retractable DJ experience” spread over 20,000 square feet. “Sitting on top of a true promontory in Bel Air, Palazzo di Vista, was inspired by the property’s natural beauty and the four elements of matter — and the result is nothing short of a masterpiece,” Aaron Kirman Group founder Aaron Kirman told The Post of the home,  adding that it brings a “calming sensation to those lucky enough to enter the grounds, escaping the bustling city of Los Angeles below.” “Palazzo di Vista is the pinnacle of luxury — where technology, art, entertainment, and wellness all meet to create an architectural masterpiece,” added Chad Roffers, president of Concierge Auctions, which recently auctioned a $126 million, 105,000-square-foot Los Angeles mansion. The home will go up for auction via luxury real estate marketplace Concierge Auctions on April 21, with anyone in the world able to bid online. The home is set to sell with a $50 million reserve.
