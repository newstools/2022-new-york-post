A new poll has found that a shocking number of people have voluntarily eaten food out of garbage cans. But, in a more alarming reveal, more than one-fifth of those surveyed said they have no problem eating food in the bathroom — and 18% of those surveyed admitted to eating while actually sitting on the toilet. The concerning findings come from 2,000 UK adults who fessed up to the most bizarre places where they have shamelessly eaten food. South West News Service reported that one in five admitted to consuming already-trashed food that looked “perfectly fine” in their eyes. That bears an uncomfortably close resemblance to the Season 6 “Seinfeld” scene in which George Costanza (Jason Alexander) is caught sampling from kitchen garbage. The research also found that over a quarter of individuals enjoy a nibble in a storage room at work, a swimming pool, a laundry room, a backyard children’s playhouse — and even during a workout. “The locations speak for themselves, of the lengths people will go to have a quick bite,” psychologist Jo Hemmings told SWNS. “Sometimes, simply just snacking away from others can give you a moment of peace to enjoy something in its purest form.” Though it was paradise lost for a quarter of respondents who actually got caught snacking in their special places, 30% also admitted to thinking their friends and family would be shocked at where they stop to have a bite. “While many reach for snacks as a comforting habit, others would prefer people not to know about their cravings,” Hemmings said.  One-third of people additionally admitted to bringing their own noshes over to someone else’s home in anticipation of a less-than-desirable meal being served, with 40% of those downing their stash in secret.
