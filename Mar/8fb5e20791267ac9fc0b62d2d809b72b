Saint Peter’s is coming off the upset of the tournament thus far with their first round victory over blue-blood Kentucky. The Peacocks, a small school from Jersey City, New Jersey, will look to keep their cinderella story alive against the seven-seed Murray State Racers. Gametime: 7:45pm EST TV: CBS Live Stream: CBS Sports App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The Peacocks’ upset of Kentucky will forever be their pride. It will be referenced as long as people build brackets. But the greatest athletic achievement in school history won’t help them two days later. Often, the unexpected high and unfamiliar attention is harmful. Only two of the previous 15-seeds to win a first round game have reached the Sweet 16. Six of the seven 15-seeds to lose in the second round fell by double-digits, losing by an average of 19 points. A mid-major like Murray State won’t take Saint Peter’s lightly and won’t allow the Peacocks’ lackluster offense to get any easy looks. The Racers will control the glass and capitalize off of the Peacocks’ turnover problems, claiming their 22nd straight win. Saint Peter’s will still have “One Shining Moment” to look forward to.
