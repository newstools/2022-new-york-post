A man pointed a gun at a Manhattan Goodwill employee and shoved the worker during a dispute this week, disturbing new video shows. The suspect got into an argument with the employee inside the thrift store on West 14th Street near Fifth Avenue around 4:10 p.m. Thursday, when he suddenly displayed a gun, cops said. Video released early Friday shows the suspect pulling the gun out of his jacket and pointing the weapon directly at the side of the worker’s head. Then he pushed the worker to the ground and took off, according to cops and the clip. The victim did not report any injuries. The nature of the dispute leading up to the incident is unclear. Police were still looking for the suspect Friday morning.
