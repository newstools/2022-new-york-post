Google employees will be required to return to the company’s offices for at least three days of in-person work per week starting on April 4, the company said Wednesday. The new work schedule, which Google argued “balances the best of being together in person and being anywhere,” will apply to employees in New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area and several other US cities. Most “Googlers” will be required to work in-person for at least three days per week and some teams may require more than three days per week in-person, the company said in a statement to The Post. “Our hybrid model balances the best of being together in person and being anywhere — where teams can intentionally come together to collaborate and connect in the office, and spend the other days working from wherever best suits their needs,” Google said. Google will continue to enforce a previously-announced requirement that all must employees must be vaccinated unless they get an an exemption for “medical or other protected reasons.” The company also said that masks will be optional for New York and Bay Area staffers who are fully vaccinated. “We also know that Googlers value having more options for where and how they work, and they’ll be able to explore flexible work options including ‘work from anywhere’ weeks, location transfers or fully remote work,” Google added. “Employees who need more time before returning can also request a work-from-home extension.” The news comes after Facebook parent Meta said that employees who have not asked to permanently work from home will return to the office starting on March 28. Meta and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn have both given many employees the option of working remotely forever — but have warned that workers who ditch New York and San Francisco for cheaper locales will see pay cuts.
