And while improved might indeed be the byproduct after the newness is, well, less new, at the start of most endeavors, there is the need for adjustment, increased familiarity and progressive comfort before any real improvement takes hold. And that’s where the Giants are, sorting their way through a new front-office hierarchy, led by general manager Joe Schoen and assistant GM Brandon Brown (formerly of the Eagles), and a new coaching staff hierarchy, topped by head coach Brian Daboll, offensive coordinator Mike Kafka (who arrived via the Chiefs) and defensive coordinator Wink Martindale (Ravens), as well as several new assistants. When a franchise initiates such widespread upheaval, growing pains are inevitable. Like it or not, the Giants at this time of year are behind the teams that did not make wholesale changes. Schoen has to get in sync with the existing pro personnel department in time for NFL free agency and must connect with the entire scouting staff for the upcoming NFL Draft. Daboll has to make sure his new coaching staff is on the same page with how they are evaluating players, as this is roster-building time.
