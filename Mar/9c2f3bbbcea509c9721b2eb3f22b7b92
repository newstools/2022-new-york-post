Jordan Davis, the 341-pound Georgia defensive tackle, clocked a stunning 4.78 40-yard dash at the NFL combine on Saturday night. At 6-foot-6 3/8, Davis is taller than Rob Gronkowkski and at 341 pounds, he’s heavier than Jason Peters, per NFL Research. His 40 time, though, was faster than Patrick Mahomes. According to ESPN, it’s the fastest time for any player over 300 pounds at the combine since 2006 and is believed to be one of the fastest ever for a player of that size. Davis’ standing broad jump of 10 feet, 3 inches is also believed to be a record for a player over 300 pounds. Davis, 22, played 14 games for Georgia last year as a key piece of their interior line. He recorded five tackles for loss and two sacks, with most of his value coming on first and second down against the run. He also scored a rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs. Davis was a unanimous All-American and won both the Chuck Bednarik Award and Outland Trophy. Davis is expected to go in the first round and could climb as high as the top 10 after an impressive combine performance. Other highly rated defensive linemen such as Aidan Hutchinson (4.75), Kayvon Thibodeaux (4.58) and David Ojabo (4.55) ran faster than Davis, but are much lighter and play on the edge, instead of the interior. Fellow Georgia defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, though, clocked a 4.77 and measures in at 6-foot-3, 304 pounds.
