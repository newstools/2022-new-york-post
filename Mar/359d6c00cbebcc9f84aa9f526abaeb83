What is a good deal, Alex? The longtime and final home of Alex Trebek is getting a new owner. The California residence of the late beloved Jeopardy host — who commuted from the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City and back for 30 years — is now in contract, The Post has learned. It was last asking $7 million. Trebek — who died from stage 4 pancreatic cancer in 2020 at age 80 — had initially purchased The Studio City estate for $2.15 million in 1991. The five-bedroom, 11 bathroom Mediterranean-style mansion entered into contract on Wednesday and first hit the market on January 22, less than a year after his death. Sources told The Post at the time, Trebek’s wife, Jean, was ready to let go of the home she had shared with her husband for decades. “She knew in order to ever move forward she would have to let go of the house” the insider said. Situated in the hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, the 10,000-square-foot home in the upscale Fryman Estates comes packed with amenities. The main residence features a wet bar in gold and white, a 45-foot-long movie theater with red carpet and matching drapes, a butler’s pantry, formal and informal dining rooms, a library with a stone fireplace and multiple balconies and verandas. Situated on 1.5 acres of land, there is also a detached one-bedroom, two-bathrooms guest house. Expansive grounds include a pool, lush greenery and mature oak trees. Meanwhile, Jean, 58, has downsized to a smaller three-bedroom, 3.5 bathroom home in the same neighborhood. Trebek’s daughter, Emily, who is the real estate agent with Compass representing the listing, has not returned The Post’s request for comment.
