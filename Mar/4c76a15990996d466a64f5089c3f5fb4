Russell Westbrook and the Lakers are apparently on the same page when it comes to his fit in Los Angeles – or lack thereof. The first-year Laker and the franchise have mutual interest in finding Westbrook a new team this summer, according to Bleacher Report. The new report comes amid Westbrook’s continued shooting struggles and inability to gel with the LeBron James-led squad. The point guard’s offensive lull — which included shooting 5-for-17 Tuesday in a loss to the Mavericks — and knack for turning the ball over has landed him a spot on the bench late in games. Westbrook, who has started all 59 games he has appeared in as a Laker, reportedly isn’t keen on the idea of a sixth man role. According to B/R, the Rockets were interested in a potential Westbrook-John Wall swap, but the discussions with L.A. “didn’t generate significant traction” due to the Lakers’ reluctancy to give up their 2027 first-round pick. Westbrook has a $47 million player option for the 2022-23 season, similar to what Wall has left on his contract. If the Lakers decide to stretch Westbrook’s contract, they would drop to about $2.5 million above the salary cap, B/R reported. The Lakers acquired Westbrook last summer in hopes of forming a Big 3 with James and Anthony Davis, who has been limited to 37 games due to injuries. The buzz about Westbrook came days after the Lakers cut DeAndre Jordan, who is likely to sign with the 76ers. The 27-34 Lakers are currently the No. 9 seed in the Western Conference, which would qualify them for the play-in tournament if the playoffs began today. The postseason begins on April 16. With 21 games left in the regular season, James, after Tuesday’s loss to the Mavericks, expressed confidence that the Lakers can turn things around.
