It was a team that included Todd Hundley, Jeff Kent, Bobby Bonilla, Bret Saberhagen, John Franco and a young first baseman named Rico Brogna, who had been traded to the Mets earlier in the season. They weren’t going to catch the Expos in the NL East (and the wild card, in its first year of existence, was also a long shot), but 13 victories in 21 games at least had stabilized a season that appeared to be spiraling out of control under manager Dallas Green. For the 24-year-old Brogna, a Watertown, Conn., native who owned a 1.006 OPS in 138 plate appearances, it seemed like his time had arrived. But he also understood why the players chose to strike over MLB’s plan to implement a salary cap after the season.
