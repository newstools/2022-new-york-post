You probably think a lot about how you have your hair during the day. But did you know what you do with it during the night is just as important? According to one hair expert you should never sleep with your hair down. She says that when you’re sleeping all the tossing and turning creates a lot of friction between your hair and the pillow. Friction is your hair’s worst enemy as it causes the cuticles to rise up and break, resulting in split ends. If you’re on a mission to get stunning, healthy hair there are a few thing you can do to minimise damage. Investing in a silk or satin pillowcase will make a huge difference, since your head can move around with ease during the night. If silk pillow cases aren’t your style, you could also wear a silk bonnet to protect your hair from friction breakage. Putting your hair into protective styles before you sleep will also make a massive difference to the health of your hair. The pro suggests a loose plait is the best to keep your hair from breaking and preventing frizz. You could also sleep with a lose top-knot to keep your hair out of your face, just make sure that it isn’t too tight.
