The husband of Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte, who is Brooklyn’s Democratic Party boss and a top ally of Mayor Eric Adams, has landed a plum gig at one of the city’s main social services agencies, city officials confirmed Tuesday. This marks the second time in recent months that hubby Edu Hermelyn has come under scrutiny for allegedly benefitting from Bichotte’s powerful party boss position. His new title is Senior Advisor for Strategic Initiatives at the Department of Social Services, which handles the administrative functions of the Human Resources Administration. The two agencies and City Hall refused to disclose Hermelyn’s salary or to provide any specifics in response to questions about what qualified a Kings County district leader to hold the post. Before notching the job at HRA/DSS, The Post revealed that Hermelyn spent much of 2020 in an $80,000 job with few responsibilities on Adams’ successful campaign for Gracie Mansion. His hire into the city bureaucracy was first reported by City Limits. The position will task Hermelyn with shaping the “strategic agenda by ensuring that initiatives that influence and affect agency programs are managed from conceptualization through implementation of the initiative(s)” and requires that he “stay abreast of the elements affecting the workings of highly political and sensitive social services programs,” according to a posting viewed by The Post. It also says he will serve as a liaison with “agency providers, not-for-profits, community-based organizations, and other governmental entities to advance special projects, as required, to advance the agencies’ strategic goals and initiatives.”
