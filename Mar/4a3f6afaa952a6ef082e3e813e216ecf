Conditions on this subway train are really going down the toilet. A man was spotted Tuesday night urinating on an F train passing through Brooklyn – while several straphangers didn’t even bat an eye. The man was caught on camera relieving himself on a car in plain view of about 10 people while lying horizontally on a bench seat in between the Jay Street-MetroTech and York Street subway stations at about 6:15 p.m., according to a witness. About three commuters across from the man darted out of the line of fire during the disgusting act, but multiple strangers in a row of adjacent benches didn’t seem fazed and remained seated. “The people on the sides, they paid no attention,” said Stefano Giovannini, a freelance Post photographer who witnessed the public urination. “Nobody said anything.” After going about his business, the man zipped back up and went back to sleep. Giovannini said he notified an MTA booth worker at the Delancey Street/Essex Street station, but was given the cold shoulder. The grotesque display came less than a month after Mayor Eric Adams kicked off a plan to clean up the city’s subway system. Adams’ comprehensive subway safety initiative aims to crack down on rule-breaking underground and help the chronically homeless into shelters. Under the plan, City Hall said 30 specialized teams made up of cops, homeless outreach workers and behavioral clinicians would be dispatched to high-priority subway stations.
