The longtime Beverly Hills home of the late Chris Cornell has hit the market for $9.85 million, The Post has learned. Cornell, who was the lead vocalist of Soundgarden and Audioslave, resided in the home with his wife Vicky Karayiannis for eight years — from 2005 to 2013. The two initially purchased the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home for $4.22 million, records show. Less than five years before his untimely death, they sold it to Belgian socialite Christine Snider-Decroix for $5.1 million following their move to Miami. Snider-Decroix, who is also a singer from the Belgian pop group the Lovelettes and starred in “The Real Housewives of Paris,” otherwise known as “Les Vraies Housewives” has lived in the home ever since. Snider-Decroix was also known for translating Michael Jackson’s 1987 song “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” to French (“Je Ne Veux Pas La Fin de Nous”). Spanning over 5,800 square feet and situated on more than an acre of land, the estate has been pegged as a “pristine paradise.” Surrounded by palm trees behind a private gate, the home has been renovated and upgraded with modern finishes. Features include 20-foot ceilings in the great room with Murano chandeliers handmade in Italy. The open-concept main floor features floor-to-ceiling glass walls that look out to the infinity pool and rolling vistas. The minimalist-designed kitchen boasts stainless steel appliances, two dishwashers, a wine fridge and an espresso machine. The primary suite features a fireplace, an expansive terrace, dual bathrooms and a soaking tub. Amenities include a media room, an office, an entertainment bar, and space for a gym. Farrah Brittany with The Agency holds the listing. Cornell passed away at the age of 52 in May 2017 after tragically hanging himself following a concert performance in Detroit. His bodyguard, Martin Kirsten, discovered him in the bathroom of his suite at the MGM Grand Hotel.
