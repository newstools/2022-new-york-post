Glenn Harris, co-founder of popular American brasserie The Smith, has listed his Williamsburg home for $4.99 million. The chef bought the turn-of-the-century brick home at 326 Leonard St. for $1.87 million in 2019. “I had wanted to live there, and then COVID hit,” Harris tells Gimme, explaining that his permits were delayed; he has since completed a gut renovation. The gorgeous two-story townhouse comes with four bedrooms, five bathrooms and a chef’s kitchen, as well as a rear deck and garden — filled with boxwoods, arborvitae, and raised beds for vegetables and herbs. The smart-wired home (listed by Douglas Elliman’s Patricia Vance) boasts oak floors, radiant heat, skylights and a finished basement. Harris sold his Westhampton home last year for $5 million (he’d purchased that one for $3.1 million in 2017). And in 2019, he set a record when he sold his historic 19th century Greenpoint townhouse for $4.94 million, as we previously reported. He’s now building a (*chef’s kiss*) new home on a teardown property in Muttontown, LI.
