Here’s a move straight out of “The Art of the Deal.”After a brief stint on the market last March, Donald Trump’s Palm Beach estate has re-listed with a $10 million price increase. Initially asking $49 million last year, the home was then taken off the market two months later in May. On Monday, the home hit the market again for a whopping $59 million, according to Mansion Global. The Bermuda-style spread is a well-established property in the family portfolio of the 75-year-old former president. Owned by the limited liability company “1125 South Ocean” — managed by Eric Trump — the beachfront estate features 194 feet of ocean frontage. Records show the LLC purchased the eight-bedroom, 11-bathroom mansion in 2018 from Trump’s sister Maryanne Trump Barry for $18.5 million. At the time of the purchase, 38-year-old Eric told Mansion Global it was “a great honor to have purchased one of the finest mansions in Palm Beach.” Barry, 84, a now-retried federal appellate judge, had owned the home since 2004. The house was also marketed by Trump International Realty in 2019. Built in 1956, the property is constructed of cement and traditional stucco. Features include two oversized living rooms, an intimate formal dining room, an oceanfront terrace and a private pool and patio surrounded by lush landscaping. Spanning more than 8,200 square feet, the home is situated across the street from Mar-a-Lago. The prospective owner would have access to a full membership at the golf club — a perk available to all residents of Woodbridge Road. Other amenities include entertaining areas with a formal living room, sunroom, family room and a library. Luxury Palm Beach real estate broker Lawrence Moens with Lawrence A. Moens Associates holds the listing.
