If you’re longing to join the stars orbiting Jupiter, Fla. — Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Kid Rock, Kate Upton and husband Justin Verlander, Donald Trump Jr. and fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle (as well as several other members of the Trump clan) all own homes in the seaside golf town — now’s your chance. Philanthropists Ed and Deb Fitts are listing their Polynesian-inspired property at 90 Lighthouse Drive for $10.5 million. Proceeds from the sale will go to build a school, via their foundation in Littleton, N.C. Located in the exclusive Jupiter Inlet Colony, the four-bedroom, four-bath home is 5,200 square feet. Built in 1963, it features plenty of custom stone and wood details, with interiors by the San Francisco-based Wiseman Group and stunning grounds by renowned landscape design firm Kurisu. Toast your good fortune on the dreamy oceanfront lanai area, which opens to a free-form waterfall pool and patio with mosquito misting, along with a bar area. The listing brokers are Deborah Cole and Teena Lovalvo of One Sotheby’s International Realty.
