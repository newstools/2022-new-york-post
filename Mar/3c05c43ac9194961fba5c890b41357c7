Wisconsin survived No. 14 Colgate in the first round and now will square off against an Iowa State team which knocked off No. 6 LSU. Gametime: 6:10 p.m. TV: TNT Live Stream: March Madness Live, TNT app, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV In the first round, the offensively inept Cyclones were able to scrape by a team without its head coach because freshman Tyrese Hunter hit more 3-pointers (7-for-11) than he had hit in the previous five games combined. Regression is certain, especially against a Badgers defense capable of holding Iowa State — which lost six of its previous seven games against teams that made the NCAA Tournament — under 60 points. The Cyclones will hang around early, but Big Ten Player of the Year Johnny Davis will take over late, following his 17-point second-half effort in the first-round win over Colgate.
