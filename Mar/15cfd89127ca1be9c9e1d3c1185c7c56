Fresh cut fruit and vegetable products and ready-to-eat dips sold at Wegmans and other stores have been recalled due to possible listeria contamination. Fruit Fresh Up Inc. issued the recall for over 30 products that were processed at its Depew, NY, production facilities due to the “possible health risk from Listeria monocytogenes,” according to a recall notice posted by the Food and Drug Administration. The recall was initiated “after results from the environmental program found surfaces where products are packaged into containers to contain Listeria monocytogenes,” according to the recall. The recalled fresh cut fruits and vegetable products were packaged in clear plastic containers with a “Best if Used By” date between March 5 and March 23, 2022. The ready-to-eat dips were packaged in 7-ounce clear plastic clamshell containers with a use-by date from March 15 to March 31, 2022, according to the notice. The recalled items, sold under brand names including Wegmans, Fresh Harvest, Lexington Co-op and Tops, were distributed throughout New York and surrounding states, the notice continued. Affected retailers were told to confirm that the recalled product is no longer available for purchase. To date, no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled products, according to officials. Listeria infections can cause symptoms such as severe headache and abdominal pain in healthy people and it can lead to more serious illness and death in children, elderly people and people with weakened immune systems.
