Golden Globe-winning actor Dylan McDermott, who played lawyer Bobby Donnell on “The Practice,” has been spotted house hunting for a “most wanted” condo on the Upper West Side. The actor is now a full-time member of TV producer Dick Wolf’s New York-centric world, as McDermott recently left his recurring mob boss role, as Richard Wheatley, on NBC’s “Law & Order: Organized Crime,” to play the good guy FBI agent lead in Wolf’s “FBI: Most Wanted” on CBS. McDermott recently checked out a 14th-floor unit at 2505 Broadway, at the corner of 93rd Street, where construction — slated for completion this year — has been a major inconvenience for neighborhood pedestrians. The condo McDermott looked at is asking $2.8 million. At 1,294 square feet, it features two bedrooms and 2½ bathrooms. Common charges are $1,450 a month. Details include 9-foot-11-inch ceilings and herringbone oak floors. A formal entry foyer opens to a great room and chef’s kitchen. The main bedroom comes with large closets, and a large ensuite bathroom with radiant heated white marble floors. A second bedroom also has lots of closet space. The 19-story, 41-unit gray brick and glass building — designed by ODA Architects and developed by Adam America Real Estate — features staggered units with floor-to-ceiling windows. The cantilevered design looks like elegant punch outs dotting a sleek exterior. Many have outdoor space. Building amenities include a landscaped rooftop with outdoor kitchens, courtyard terraces, a lounge, gym, children’s playroom, pet spa, parking garage and flexible space for a multi-use sports court and screening room. The building will also feature two townhouse-style duplexes and a four-bedroom penthouse with its own private rooftop terrace and views from the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge.
