Kamila Valieva is out of the figure skating world championships after the sport’s governing body banned competitors from Russia and Belarus following the invasion of Ukraine. Valieva, along with Anna Scherbakova and Alexandra Trusova, will miss the competition in Montpellier, France not because of performance enhancing drugs, but because of the unprovoked military action taken by their country. Valileva was the focal point of controversy at the Beijing Olympics after it came out that she tested positive for a banned heart medication on Dec. 25. Russia won the team competition and Valieva was allowed to compete in the individual competition after an appeal, but finished fourth after a disastrous free skate, with Scherbakova winning gold. Medals for the team competition have yet to be awarded and the image of Valieva falling during her individual program is one of the enduring moments of the Beijing games. The figure skating championships, which begin March 21, are also banning three Russian skating teams that placed in their individual Olympic events. Other international sporting bodies, including FIFA and the IIHF, have also banned Russian teams from competing. In men’s tennis, world No. 1 Daniil Medvedev and No. 7 Andrey Rublev will be allowed to compete but without the Russian flag. Russia is also banned from the Davis Cup. Governing federations in basketball, skiing, volleyball, canoeing, badminton and triathlon have all moved to exclude Russian athletes or teams from their events. In motorsport, the FIA said Russian drivers such as Haas’ Nikita Mazepin could still compete, but Mazepin was barred from the British Grand Prix. Formula 1 also cancelled its Russian Grand Prix, while UEFA moved the Champions League Final out of St. Petersburg.
