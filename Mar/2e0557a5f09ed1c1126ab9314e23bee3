A heartbreaking photo has emerged of a grieving father sobbing over his son’s dead body — draped in a blood-soaked hospital blanket — as Russia’s brutal attacks on Ukrainian cities continued to escalate. The father, only identified as Serhii, could be seen cradling his teenage son Iliya’s head on Wednesday as the boy lay on a stretcher in a hospital in the hard-hit city of Mariupol. Harrowing images showed the severely injured teen, who was dressed in his soccer uniform, earlier being wheeled into the hospital on a stretcher as his distraught father cried in the background.  The boy was missing both his legs when he arrived in the back of a car and was rushed inside. Another teen, who also appeared to have had his legs blown off, was pictured lying in the back of the same car. The condition of the second boy wasn’t immediately known.

In other grim scenes out of Mariupol, a bloodied woman was rushed to the hospital suffering severe facial injuries. Doctors also worked desperately to treat victims whose body parts had been obliterated by shelling. Iliya, the slain teenager, was among the “mass casualties” in Mariupol after Vladimir Putin’s troops started targeting kindergartens, schools and apartment blocks, officials said. The port city has endured more than 25 hours of endless Russian shelling, Mariupol’s deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov revealed on Thursday. Orlov said they feared about 200 innocent civilians had been killed in Mariupol — but no one knew for sure because officials haven’t been able to go out and “collect all the bodies.” With Post wires
