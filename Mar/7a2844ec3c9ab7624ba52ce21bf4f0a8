TAMPA ⁠— John Gibbons remembers just how Josh Donaldson made his presence felt after the Blue Jays traded for the All-Star third baseman following the 2014 season. “He came to us from Oakland and brought us that toughness that we needed,” Gibbons, who was the Blue Jays manager at the time, said this week. “We had good players like [Jose] Bautista and [Edwin] Encarnacion, but Josh gave us that edge.” That edge helped the Blue Jays reach the ALCS in each of Donaldson’s first two seasons in Toronto. Gibbons doesn’t believe it was a coincidence.
