A duo followed a man into his Upper Manhattan building and robbed him of $100,000 at gunpoint, police said early Tuesday. The suspects followed the 27-year-old victim into his lobby at Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Fort George around 3:50 a.m. Wednesday, cops said. Video released by the NYPD shows one of the suspects pointing a gun at the victim, while the other pulled on the back of his shirt. Both suspects, wearing green latex gloves, forced the victim up to his apartment, where they restrained him with an extension cord, cops said. They then removed his jewelry and about $100,000 in cash, police said. The pair fled via the fire escape, and took off in a white BMW SUV. In an unrelated incident in the Fordham Manor section of the Bronx, a solo attacker approached a 42-year-old man inside a residential building at West 192nd Street and Jerome Avenue around 11 p.m. March 10, cops said. Just as the victim attempted to unlock a door down the hallway, the suspect suddenly shoved him against a wall and repeatedly punched him in the face, video released late Monday shows. The suspect grabbed a wallet, $60 and 1,500 pesos — worth about $74 — a credit card and a MetroCard from the victim before fleeing, cops said. The man suffered serious leg and eye injuries, and was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition.
