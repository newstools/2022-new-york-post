Our favorite cookware brand is dropping a new shade called “Acid” — no, not that kind of acid. If you follow Our Place on Instagram then you know the brand released a new neon green color of their viral Always Pan and Perfect Pot today, that’s perfect for spring. As an added bonus, those who choose the Acid color for either the Always Pan ($145) or the matching Perfect Pot ($165) will get their items shipped out and delivered in just a week. Even better, if you do choose to add both the pan and the pot to your cart, get a wicked discount on both, marking your total down to just $250 for both, instead of the normal price of $310. The striking color is pretty unique, but also an amazing statement piece for your kitchen in the spring, as we can just imagine how good warm summer salads and cold soups will look in the matching cookware. As a reminder, both the Always Pan and the matching Perfect Pot are made of a non-stick ceramic coating that is non-toxic and super easy to clean. We reviewed the Always Pan and loved how it really does replace eight kitchen tools and boils it all down to one — pun intended this time. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
