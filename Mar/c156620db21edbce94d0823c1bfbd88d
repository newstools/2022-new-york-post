After nearly two years on the market, Scarlett Johansson has finally sold her longtime Manhattan penthouse at a loss, The Post can report. The Oscar-nominated actress, 38, purchased the two-bedroom, two-bathroom Sutton Place spread more than a decade ago, in 2008, for $2.1 million. She sold it for only $1.87 million on March 11, records show. Aside from the instant $223,000 loss, additional pricey renovations and updates to the property over the years add to her losses. But with an estimated $165 million net worth, and pegged as the world’s highest-paid actress in 2018 and 2019, it’s likely the “Black Widow” star isn’t losing too much sleep over it. Initially listing the home for $2.5 million in July 2020, the Marvel actress wasn’t able to secure a buyer after cutting the price down to $1.89 million in December. While it remained on the market, it listed for rent at $6,500 per month. Overlooking the East River, the home boasts a terrace with skyline views and space for al fresco dining. Features include hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling sliding windows and an updated open kitchen with luxe marble countertops. There’s also an expansive walk-in closet in the primary suite. Amenities of the white-glove postwar building include a full-time doorman, an additional laundry room and a parking garage. Meanwhile, her husband and “Saturday Night Live” star, Colin Jost, listed his longtime West Village duplex back in October and already has a pending offer on the home. Jost, 39, listed the two-bedroom, two-bathroom residence shortly after he welcomed his first child with Johansson last August. Noble Black with Douglas Elliman held the listing.
