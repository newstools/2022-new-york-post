Shocking video shows a homophobic subway rider swinging a stranger around by the hair — ripping some of it out — after spitting at him and saying, “I’m sick of all you f–s,” according to cops. The bigot — who was caught smiling widely after the attack — had sat opposite the 22-year-old victim on an A train as it was approaching the 190th Street subway station in Hudson Heights just before 2:30 p.m. Saturday, the NYPD said. “I wish I had my pepper spray,” the attacker said, spitting at the stranger and adding, “I have to start carrying my pepper spray,” cops said. The victim stood up after the deranged stranger spat at him again — just to be punched several times in the face and head, the NYPD said. Another straphanger filmed as the black-clad thug yanked his victim around the mostly empty subway car by his hair, pausing only to beat him. After ripping out some of the 22-year-old stranger’s hair, the attacker said, “I’m sick of all you f–s,” police said of the assault being investigated by the NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force. The victim was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in stable condition after losing hair and suffering cuts to his head, police said.
