Morris Day claimed in an Instagram post on Thursday that the estate of the late singer Prince is barring him from using the name Morris Day & The Time. “I’ve given 40 years of my life building up a name and legacy that Prince and I came up with,” Day wrote in the social media post. While Prince was alive, he did not have a problem with the name’s use, Day continued. “However, now that Prince is no longer with us, suddenly, the people who control his multi million dollar estate want to rewrite history by taking my name away from me, thus impacting how i feed my family. So as of now, per the Prince Estate, [I] can no longer use Morris Day & The Time in any capacity,” according to the post. A representative for the estate disputed Day’s post. “Given Prince’s longstanding history with Morris Day and what the Estate thought were amicable discussions, The Prince Estate was surprised and disappointed to see his recent post. The Estate is open to working proactively with Morris to resolve this matter. However, the information that he shared is not entirely accurate,” the rep wrote in a statement to The Post. Prince started the Time in 1981. The group had hits like “Cool,” “The Bird” and “Jungle Love,” and the band was part of his 1984 movie “Purple Rain.” Day’s post is not the first time there has been contention about the group’s name. In 2011, the band, which includes hit producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, tried to release an album, “Condensate.” Prince, who retained rights to the band’s name, “would not let them release it as ‘The Time,’ so they recorded and performed as the Original 7ven instead,” the Star Tribune reported. “Everything’s kinda crazy,” Day told the Star Tribune. “This has created a storm of response. I don’t want to talk about it right now. There will be a time when it’s appropriate to talk.”
