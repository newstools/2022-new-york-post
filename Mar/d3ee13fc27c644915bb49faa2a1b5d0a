Antonio Brown is shooting for the star. The mercurial wide receiver joined “The Pivot Podcast” with former NFLers Ryan Clark, Channing Crowder and Fred Taylor, and made his pitch to Jerry Jones to join the Dallas Cowboys. “The plan is to get back into the game,” Brown said, when asked about his plans for next season. “Maybe Jerry Jones thinks it looks sexy that I’m putting out all this motivation and all this hard work and encouragement. Maybe he want to harness some of that energy.” If the Cowboys’ owner indeed thinks Brown’s motivation, hard work and encouragement is sexy and wants to harness some of that energy, it’s still a little tricky to make it happen. The Cowboys have negative cap space heading into the season, and various reports emerged this week that they are considering parting with the likes of defensive end Demarcus Lawrence, wide receiver Amari Cooper and center La’el Collins. While Jones and the Cowboys have brought on a number of players that were deemed character risks over the years, Brown’s antics might be a lot for even them to handle. In his last game with the Buccaneers, Brown famously quit during the second quarter, tossing his jersey into the crowd and doing shirtless jumping jacks in the end zone at MetLife Stadium. This followed several years of personal and legal issues that led him to be exiled by the Steelers, Raiders and Patriots before the Bucs. The other team that Brown has courted this offseason is the Baltimore Ravens; Brown spent Super Bowl Sunday with their quarterback Lamar Jackson.
