The NIT championship game is set for Thursday night at Madison Square Garden and BJ Cunningham of the Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The matchup will feature Texas A&M out of the SEC against Xavier from the Big East, the former of which arrives as consensus four-point favorites. But, despite its impressive run through the tournament, Cunningham isn’t entirely convinced the Aggies will continue to roll against Xavier. The first potential area of concern for the favorites? Its poor record on the glass and lack of height. “Texas A&M is a horrible defensive rebounding team – they’re 340th to be exact,” Cunningham says. “And while Xavier is only slightly above average – 169th in offensive rebounding rate – they’re 22nd in average height. Texas A&M is around 300th.” Plus, even though Texas A&M tends to turn opponents over quite well, Cunningham details that Xavier is top-60 nationally in offensive turnover percentage. On the offensive end, Cunningham believes Xavier’s defense can cause problems for an Aggies offense that likes to attack the rim. Entering this matchup, Xavier ranks in the top-40 nationally in terms of field-goal percentage allowed at the rim.  Lastly, given Xavier is a decent three-point shooting team – a defensive vertical in which Texas A&M struggles – Cunningham believes Xavier’s offense will cause problems for head coach Buzz Williams’ squad. For those reasons, Cunningham is choosing to back the Musketeers +4 Thursday night.
