The Yankees aren’t done making moves just yet. After re-signing Anthony Rizzo, the Yankees traded Luke Voit to the Padres for pitching prospect Justin Lange on Friday, the team announced. That clears the way for Rizzo to play first base without any questions about whether Voit or Giancarlo Stanton should DH. Lange, a 20-year old right-hander, was drafted in the first round in 2020 and had nine appearances with a 6.95 ERA in the Arizona Complex League last season. Voit slashed .239/.328/.437 over 68 games for the Yankees and could DH for the Padres — who have Eric Hosmer at first base — with the National League now allowing the designated hitter.
