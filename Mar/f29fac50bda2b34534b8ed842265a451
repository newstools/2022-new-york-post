Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and his bandmates made an emotional return to Los Angeles following the shocking death of drummer, Taylor Hawkins, on tour in Colombia. Grohl appeared visibly stricken Saturday as he embraced a man believed to be their manager, John Silva, after touching down in the US from Bogota. He was joined by bandmates, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett and Rami Jaffee, as well as jazz singer Samantha Sidley. Hawkins, 50, was found dead Friday in a hotel room at the Four Seasons Casa Medina in Bogota. There has been no official cause released of his death, although the band said in a statement Friday that his passing was a “tragic and untimely loss.” Prosecutors in Colombia released a statement Saturday saying toxicological tests on urine from Hawkins’ body preliminarily found 10 psychoactive substances and medicines, including marijuana, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. And reports emerged Sunday that the drummer died of cardiovascular collapse. The Foo Fighters, which had been on tour in South America, had been set to play at a festival in Bogota, Colombia, on Friday night. “His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever,” the band said on Twitter. “Our hearts go out to his wife, children and family.”
