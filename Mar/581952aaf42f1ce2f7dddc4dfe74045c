A star Michigan edge rusher survived a couple seasons of college football and positioned himself for millions – only to go down a month before the NFL draft. David Ojabo, a projected first-round pick, suffered a torn Achilles at Michigan’s Pro Day, ESPN reported Saturday. It’s likely to be a significant blow to his draft value – Ojabo had also been linked as a possibility for the Jets or Giants. According to ESPN, doctors hope Ojabo can be on a similar timeline to Rams running back Cam Akers, who tore his Achilles in July and debuted in January. If Ojabo misses six months, he could return in September, though the injury often can be tricky. “God got me!!” Ojabo tweeted after the injury. “ima be back stronger than ever. all part of my story.” The 21-year-old reportedly was injured in a pass-rushing drill and collapsed to the grass after a non-contact injury. Trainers had to help him off the field. Ojabo, who was born in Nigeria, grew up in Scotland and went to high school in New Jersey, had 11 sacks in 13 games with the Wolverines last season.
