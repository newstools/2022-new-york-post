The road to a championship in most sports often features rivalries and rematches that make the games even more fun for fans. But because of the unique setup of college basketball and the NCAA Tournament, it’s a little more rare to see the same two schools competing in March year after year. When we do get a fun rematch, it stands out. Thursday’s Sweet 16 showdown between Michigan and Villanova checks this box. Villanova bested Michigan in the 2018 national championship game, earning Jay Wright and the Wildcats their second title in just three years. Two of Villanova’s contributors in that game are still on the roster and will start on Thursday night. Meanwhile, Michigan has a new coach and a crop of younger, fresh talent with eyes on revenge and a spot in the Elite Eight. Are the Wolverines a worthy underdog for your wagering dollar? I think so. Michigan’s star center Hunter Dickinson should be primed for a big night. The 7-foot-1 sophomore dwarfs Villanova’s biggest starter, 6-8 Eric Dixon. Dickinson’s go-to baby hook shot should be available all night long. If Dixon gets into foul trouble, Villanova doesn’t play any other big man taller than 6-7.  Jermaine Samuels is a springy athlete but would be wildly outmatched trying to contain Dickinson in the post. Wright has to be scheming up double teams from all over the court, and Villanova’s strategy to slow down Dickinson is the key item to watch in this game. As an underdog with the primary focus in the game on its side, Michigan has to like its chances. Villanova is always capable of shooting its way into any win, but the Wildcats’ lack of size and depth has to factor in as this tournament continues. I’ll take my chances on the Wolverines. The play: Michigan, ML (+180).
