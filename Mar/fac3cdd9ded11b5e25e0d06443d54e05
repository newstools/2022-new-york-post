The longstanding beef has been squashed. On Sunday, when Kevin Garnett got his jersey retired by the Celtics, Ray Allen was there by his side. “It’s good to see Ray Allen here. Real s–t,” Garnett said. “It’s good to see you here baby.” There had been animosity between the two for years, dating back to when Allen left the Celtics to link up with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat in 2012. During Sunday’s festivities, Allen got up from his seat and embraced Garnett on the floor at TD Garden. Paul Piece jumped in for a hug too, with the crowd erupting into thunderous applause. Allen, meanwhile, told former Celtic Brian Scalabrine on Sunday “there was never beef.” “When I left I was so excited for my journey that I was on, but I’ve always loved these guys,” Allen said. “And the thing I hold close to my heart is not just 2008, but just that whole mission. 2009 and 2010. In this building, we played some amazing games. We had an amazing time on the planes. Life was great for those five years. That’s what I focused on was the last 10 years is everything we did together — that to me is the most important.” Allen can say there was no beef, but that doesn’t appear to be entirely true. For instance, when Allen was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018, he told Rachel Nichols that Garnett, Pierce nor Rajon Rondo had called to congratulate him. “What I’ve learned, Rachel, is this is all you have are moments,” Allen said at the time. “I don’t have any ill will against anybody. Everybody – good and bad – has got me to this moment. So I think about the things I’ve learned, the bad the times I’ve gone through the most that have allowed me to get back up and say, ‘Let me get better.’” Even as recently as last month, Garnett seemed to snub Allen at the NBA All-Star game’s ceremony for the 75 greatest players of all time. Regardless, it now is a case of letting bygones be bygones.
