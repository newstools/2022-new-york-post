Ex-CNN boss Jeff Zucker reached an eight-figure settlement with WarnerMedia over his sudden departure last month, according to a report. Zucker, who left abruptly after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a colleague, would waive his right to sue his former employer under the deal, Deadline said Tuesday. Word of the settlement came after Zucker reportedly hired a heavyweight law firm to put WarnerMedia on notice that CEO Jason Kilar’s characterization of his departure bordered on defamatory. The media conglomerate was said to not be interested in another wave of bad press which could accompany a prolonged civil suit, according to the article. Zucker resigned on Feb. 2 for failing to disclose his longterm relationship with Allison Gollust, a former top aide of ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo turned chief network spokesperson. As CNN talent publicly questioned the move, Kilar sent out a memo that said a third-party law firm found Zucker and Gollust violated company policies. Lawyers found that the pair had an inappropriately close friendship with Cuomo, coaching him on his COVID-19 briefings and calling on him to do segments with his brother, Chris Cuomo, CNN’s former star anchor. Chris Cuomo was suspended from the network for advising Andrew try on the sexual harassment complaints that ended the Democrat’s political career. Chris Cuomo was fired days later when the network got wind of a credible accusation of sexual assault against him from a decade before, according to The New York Times. Gollust negotiated her own settlement of $1 million after pushing back on Kilar’s statement and claiming she was blindsided by the legal investigation, Deadline said. Chris Cuomo was seeking “Megyn Kelly money” from the network, and was pursuing a $60 million deal as his brother dipped his toe back into the political arena.
