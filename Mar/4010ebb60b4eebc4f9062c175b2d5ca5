Julia Rose is enjoying a girls getaway in Tulum after her breakup with Jake Paul. Page Six reported Tuesday the YouTuber-turned-pro boxer has been out and about in Miami, telling friends he and Rose are done. While Paul is “devastated” over the split, Rose appears to be in good spirits in a series of sultry photos she shared to Instagram. The model posted videos to her Instagram Story that showed her smoking hookah with friends in Cancun, before the group stepped out for a firework display. Rose shared a snap of a sign that read, “Bad decisions make better stories.” In one clip, she kissed one of her girlfriends while out on the town. “Cheers to missing three flights, finally getting to see Rufus live, and only eating cheese quesadillas for four days straight ,” Rose captioned a photo that showed her posing by the beach. Fans in the comments questioned. “Where’s Jake?” while others celebrated her new single status. “Cheers to breaking up with Jake Paul,” one person wrote. Paul and Rose — who first met in 2019, when she portrayed his girlfriend in the music video for his song, “These Days” — have yet to publicly address the split.
