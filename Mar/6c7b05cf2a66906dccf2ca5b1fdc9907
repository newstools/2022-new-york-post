A 14-year-old boy died late Thursday after plummeting from an amusement park ride in Orlando as his frantic parents looked on, shocked witnesses told a local Fox affiliate. Disturbing footage of the incident shared on social media shows the boy plunging from the “Orlando Free-Fall” ride at ICON Park about halfway down its 400-foot descent. Horrified witnesses and other riders began screaming after the ride came to a rest as the tragic teen lay motionless just mere feet away from them. “Oh my God!” screamed one woman. “Oh my God! He just fell! Oh my God!” Witnesses said the boy’s parents were looking on as the tragedy unfolded around 11 p.m. “Everyone was just panicking and screaming,” Montrey Williams told Fox 35. One frenzied woman can be seen asking staffers if they had secured the boy’s safety harness before the ride. “Are you sure you checked him?” she asks repeatedly. Other workers can be seen covering their mouths in paralyzed disbelief while bystanders hurried their traumatized kids away from the scene. Meanwhile, riders can be heard yelling at workers to unlock their harnesses. Orange County police have not yet released the identity of the 14-year-old boy who died after being rushed to a hospital. The “Orlando Free-Fall” opened in December 2021 and claims to be the country’s tallest free-standing drop tower. The ride stands 430 feet tall and can hold up to 30 people. The ride spins around a gigantic tower after it reaches peak level in the air. Riders are positioned forward with their faces at the ground before dropping at 75 miles per hour. An investigation is ongoing. In 2020, a worker died while performing maintenance on a different attraction at ICON Park. Jacob Kaminsky fell about 60 feet to his death, according to the Orlando Sentinel. He was 21 years old.
