A 3-year-old girl was hit by a stray bullet while leaving her Brooklyn day care on Friday evening, police said. Shots rang out in front of 127 Riverdale Avenue in Brownsville just after 6 p.m., as the child was leaving the two-story building that houses Creative Minds Family Day Care with her father, according to cops and day care workers. Police officers bandaged the gunshot wound on the girl’s shoulder and then rushed her to Brookdale Hospital in their own cruiser, said NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey. The child remains hospitalized in stable condition. Police said the gunman squeezed off around five shots before fleeing on foot. It’s unclear who he was aiming at, but the target was not the girl’s father, Corey told reporters. A day care employee, who did not wish to be identified, told The Post of the shooting: “it happened so fast.” Two other children were also in the vicinity but were unharmed, the worker said. Holding up a surveillance image of the suspect, Corey implored New Yorkers: “Help us catch him before he shoots another child.” “When do we come together as a community and as a city and say enough is enough?,” he added. Friday evening’s shooting comes after a 7-year-old girl was grazed by a stray bullet, also in Brooklyn, earlier this week. An 11-month-old girl was hit by a stray bullet in The Bronx in January. “We need to fix this, we need to save these children, and we need to save our city,” Corey said.
