Be Taylor Swift’s neighbor — if she doesn’t beat you to it. The singer has spent a jaw-dropping $47.7 million over the years buying huge swaths of a Tribeca block, mainly in the 19th-century Sugar Loaf Building at 155 Franklin St. That’s where she owns a duplex penthouse and half of the building’s second floor. Now, the remaining half of the second floor is up for sale, asking $6.25 million. The three-bedroom, 2½-bathroom condo is 2,438 square feet. The classic loft — in a building that dates to 1882 — features original details such as hardwood floors, steel columns, exposed brick and beamed ceilings. The unit opens to a large foyer that leads to an open kitchen with a breakfast bar. Elsewhere inside, the master suite has two closets — and an ensuite bathroom with a double vanity, a soaking tub and a rain shower. The listing broker is Corcoran’s Jeff Wachtenheim. In 2018, Swift bought the 3,540-square-foot second-floor spread for $9.75 million from financier Jeremy Phillips in an off-market deal. She also owns two top-floor units that she combined to create an 8,000-square-foot duplex penthouse. She bought those units for $19.95 million from “Lord of the Rings” director Peter Jackson in 2014. Other high-profile names have been linked to the building. Last year, “Lord of the Rings” actor Orlando Bloom’s former unit in the building sold in less than three weeks — for $7.1 million in an all cash deal. That unit had also been a temporary home to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Past and present residents of the Sugar Loaf Building have also included actor/comedian Aziz Ansari and Academy Award winning director Steven Soderbergh. Swift also owns an $18 million townhouse next door, which comes with its own gym and spa. It’s all part of the pop star’s vast $80 million real estate portfolio, that stretches from Big Apple city streets to Rhode Island, Los Angeles and Nashville.
