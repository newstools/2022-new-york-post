Jane Campion has taken home the Oscar for Best Director at the 2022 Academy Awards. She is the third woman to win the award. Campion, who was the favorite, beat out contenders Kenneth Branagh for his semi-autobiographical piece “Belfast,” Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s “Drive My Car,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Licorice Pizza” and Steven Spielberg’s musical “West Side Story.” “I love directing because it’s a deep dive into story yet the task of manifesting a world can be overwhelming. The sweet thing is I’m not alone,” the New Zealand-born filmmaker said in her acceptance speech. “On ‘The Power of the Dog’ I worked with actors I’m moved to call my friends. They met the challenge of this story with the depth of their gifts.” She mentioned the Netflix’s Western stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons. This is not 67-year-old Campion’s first Oscar win. She previously won in 1994 for Best Original Screenplay for “The Piano.” She was also nominated that year for Best Director, but lost to Spielberg, who won for “Schindler’s List.” Two other woman have won the Best Director award: Kathryn Bigelow for “The Hurt Locker” in 2010 and Chloe Zhao for “Nomadland” last year.
