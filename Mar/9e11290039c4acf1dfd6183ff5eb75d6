“What we have seen already from Vladimir Putin’s regime in the use of the munitions that they have already been dropping on innocent civilians, in my view, already fully qualifies as a war crime,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday. A prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was investigating possible war crimes, examining missile strikes on residential buildings in Kharkiv and other cities. President Biden said “it’s clear” that Russian forces are targeting civilians. He stopped short of accusing Putin of war crimes, but there’s certainly a case against the Russian dictator. Putin has offered no rational justification for invading Ukraine. He ranted that the country was rightfully Russia’s, and then made some claims about needing to “de-Nazify” the nation. Ukraine was no threat to his country, had not attacked Russia nor said it would. Putin doesn’t have an argument that this campaign had any legitimate military objective. Established by the Rome Statute in 1998, the International Criminal Court lists “intentionally directing attacks against civilian objects, that is, objects which are not military objectives” as one definition of a war crime. The pictures from Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv are proof enough. Russia does not recognize the international court. Neither does the United States, having not wanted a global organization to have jurisdiction over our citizens. Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage. But there is value in having the ICC investigate, try and sentence Putin in absentia. It will bare before the world the extent of his brutality, and disregard for the people of Ukraine. It’s important that, whatever happens in Ukraine, Putin isn’t allowed to return to a normal relationship with the West. Render the verdict for history: Guilty of being a war criminal.
