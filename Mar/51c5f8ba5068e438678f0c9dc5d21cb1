Bettors have nine games to choose from on Monday’s NBA card and Action Network NBA analyst Dan Titus has three props for bettors to target (video above). For Titus, the core philosophy behind this play is Sabonis’ above-average performances against the Bulls this season. “[Sabonis] is averaging 13.3 rebounds in four contests against the Bulls [and] has gone over this line in three of those four games,” Titus details. Add in that Sabonis is averaging 12.8 rebounds per game since joining the Kings and Titus likes him to continue his positive gameplay tonight in Sacramento. Coming off a season-low eight points against the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday, Titus expects a good bounceback performance from Curry, especially when factoring in Draymond Green’s return to the lineup. “When Draymond is on the court, [Curry] is scoring 3.1 more points/game this season,” Titus says. Further, Curry has a good history against the Wizards as the Davidson product is averaging close to 27 points/game in his career against Monday’s opposition.  The reasoning? Johnson arrives at this contest having cleared this line in only four of his last 10 games. Plus, even though the T’Wolves could miss two key defenders, Titus believes this line is still inflated. “Johnson doesn’t do much in the assist department – he’s only averaging 1.8/game,” Titus says. “And when facing teams above .500, Johnson is only averaging 23 points + rebounds + assists.”
