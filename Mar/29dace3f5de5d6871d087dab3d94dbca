Nick Kyrgios very much has the future with girlfriend Costeen Hatzi on his mind. The 26-year-old tennis pro appeared to stun both Hatzi and Australian TV presenter Karl Stefanovic during a recent interview on “Today,” when Kyrgios offered a candid response about where he sees his budding relationship going. “None of it would have happened without her to be honest,” Kyrgios said of his Australian Open doubles victory in January, per News.com.au. Hatzi, whose relationship with Kyrgios became public in late 2021, also replied “yes” when asked if the Australian athlete would be her “last tennis player.” Kyrgios then lightly dropped the comment, “Until the little ones come,” which resulted in a “whoa” from Stefanovic and a “What?” from Hatzi. When Stefanovic then steered the conversation back to chatter about the future, Hatzi said Kyrgios could take the wheel. “She doesn’t want to talk about just yet, but I’m not going anywhere anytime soon,” Kyrgios said. Kyrgios, who had a messy split from Chiara Passari last fall, has openly gushed about Hatzi, the founder of Casa Amor Interiors, in Q&As over the past few months. In February, Kyrgios spoke about the couple’s romance on the “Life Uncut” podcast. “She’s the one,” Kyrgios said at the time. Hatzi supported Kyrgios at the Australian Open in January, including the moment he and Thanasi Kokkinakis won the doubles title. “AUSTRALIAN OPEN 2022 DOUBLES CHAMPIONS!!!  I love you so much & I am extremely proud of you. What an achievement, there’s no one else more deserving than you,” she captioned a video on Instagram.
