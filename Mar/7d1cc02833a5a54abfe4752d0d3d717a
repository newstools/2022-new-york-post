Two women were arrested after allegedly trying to shoot a New Mexico deputy Tuesday morning before leading authorities on a wild chase that turned into a standoff, authorities said. The chaos unfolded around 10:15 a.m. when Lizeth Iguado, 33 and Felicia Gonzales, 39 allegedly tried to carjack a vehicle at gunpoint in Albuquerque’s southern outskirts, according to the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office. A witness trailed the suspects’ black Jeep and called 911. When police caught up with the women, they shot at the pursuing deputy, who was not struck, officials said. The suspects then abandoned their SUV, fled on foot and broke into a trailer on private property, cops alleged. Multiple police agencies, a bomb unit and a SWAT team coaxed the pair of the hideout without incident, according to the sheriff’s office. The suspects are “local repeat offenders with many visits to the Metropolitan Detention Center,” and Iguado was on probation after being convicted of shooting at a car in 2019, Bernalillo County authorities said. “It is incredibly disappointing that New Mexico has such a broken criminal justice system that these suspects lack fear of prosecution enough to shoot at our deputies.”
