TAMPA — The Yankees signed right-hander Shelby Miller to a minor league deal on Sunday, with an invitation to major league camp. The 31-year-old was an All-Star with the Braves in 2015, when he pitched 205 ¹/₃ innings, but has struggled since. Most recently, the first-round pick of the Cardinals in 2009 split last season between Triple-A and the majors with the Cubs and Pirates. He had a 9.24 ERA in 12 ²/₃ innings with Chicago and Pittsburgh. “He’s had success in this league,’’ Aaron Boone said. “He had early success in his career as a starter and we hope we can unlock some things to provide us with some upside and get to the potential he’s had all along.” Boone said it’s undetermined whether Miller will work as a starter or out of the bullpen.
