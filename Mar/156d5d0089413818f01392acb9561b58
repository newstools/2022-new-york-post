Paulina Gretzky is gearing up for her big day following an epic bachelorette party in St. Barths. On Wednesday, the fiancée of golfer Dustin Johnson revealed she had traveled to New York for some apparent wedding prep with pals Kristina Melnichenko, Jeremy Cohen, and future sister-in-law Samantha Maddox, who is married to Johnson’s brother Austin. In one video shared on her Instagram Story, Gretzky gave her one million followers a peek inside her luxurious accommodations at Casa Cipriani, a private members club. Next, she appeared to pop some bubbly while captioning the post, “wedding dress [check].” Gretzky, 33, is expected to wear a Vera Wang creation for the highly anticipated nuptials, exclaiming in August how the prolific designer crafted the “wedding dress of dreams.” Last week, Gretzky jetted to St. Barths for a wild bachelorette bash with her inner circle, which also included Melnichenko, Cohen, and Maddox. The group checked out a slew of celebrity hot spots — Bagatelle and Nikki Beach, to name a few — and partied the days away with dancing and custom drinks, including “No Regretzkys.” Johnson, who has been engaged to Gretzky since 2013, also enjoyed his bachelor party in St. Barths, per The Daily Mail. In a clip that appeared on Cohen’s Instagram Story, Johnson is seen doing a backflip into the water. Cohen also shared a collection of images Tuesday on Instagram from the festivities, which featured Gretzky’s bridal party at Nikki Beach and departing a jet. Gretzky and Johnson are slated to tie the knot at Blackberry Farm in Tennessee sometime this year. The couple shares two children together, sons Tatum, 7, and River, 4.
