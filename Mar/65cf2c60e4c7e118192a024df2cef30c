MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Cam Reddish’s chances of proving to Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau he belongs will have to wait until next season. Reddish, who left the team Tuesday during the current road trip for further examinations in New York, will miss the rest of the season with a right shoulder AC joint injury, the Knicks announced. The Knicks acquired Reddish from the Hawks in January, giving up Kevin Knox and a conditional Hornets first-round pick that is not expected to convey next season because of Charlotte’s recent slide. (It’s protected up to the 19th pick this June.) The Post reported coach Tom Thibodeau was against the Reddish deal because he had a set rotation. Reddish managed to sneak into the rotation because of a spate of injures and recently was a plus-player. Thibodeau’s concern was the former Duke forward wasn’t a tough enough defender. Reddish, who has one year left on his pact, appeared in 15 games for the Knicks, averaging 6.1 points in 14 minutes but shot just 25.8 percent from 3. He injured his right shoulder during the game Monday in Sacramento when he rose up to block a Davion Mitchell drive and landed on his hand and shoulder. He was in a sling after the game. On Wednesday, Thibodeau said he didn’t want to comment when asked if Reddish’s injury would keep him out a long while.
