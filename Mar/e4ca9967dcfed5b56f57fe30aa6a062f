This is not the kind of roadside attraction Google users were expecting. A couple has been caught having sex by the side of a highway in photos uploaded to Google Street View. The explicit images were reportedly taken on Dukes Highway just outside the Australian town of Keith — about halfway between the cities of Adelaide and Melbourne. The saucy snaps show the amorous Aussies enjoying each other’s company in broad daylight while next to their silver BMW. The pair are clearly in the throes of passion, with the woman bent over the hood of the vehicle and her male partner positioned directly behind. In one image — snapped by a Google Street View van — the woman can be seen sporting a startled expression on her face, seemingly surprised that she has been busted in the roadside romp. The pair are not identifiable from the saucy images and it’s not believed they were arrested over the act. According to South Australian law, public sex is punishable by a AUD $1,100 fine or up to six months in prison. According to the Daily Star, the Google Street View photos were uploaded in 2013, but have now resurfaced on Reddit. Google workers didn’t appear to notice the kinky couple before publishing the photos online. However, it appears that the pictures have now been taken down. The Post has contacted the company for comment.
