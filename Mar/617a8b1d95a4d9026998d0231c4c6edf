Horrific video captured the moment a 12-year-old girl was sent flying into the air after she was struck by a Mercedes sedan on an Upper Manhattan street Thursday afternoon. The girl, who was critically injured in the scary collision, was struck as she tried to cross Audubon Avenue at the intersection of 170th Street in Washington Heights just before 12:30 p.m., according to police. Surveillance footage of the accident, obtained by The Post, shows the victim creeping up in the crosswalk as a van parked in the street to her left appears to obstruct her view. Seconds later, the girl attempts to run across the street in the crosswalk, but is struck by the Mercedes that came towards her from the same direction where the van was parked. The girl was propelled into the air and collapsed in a heap roughly 15-feet away, a witness said. “I was walking with my daughter and I heard a big bang and saw her body flying in the air,” the witness told The Post. “The girl was lying in the street. She was breathing but unconscious. I was in shock. That could have been my daughter.” What appears to be one of her shoes can also be seen flying in the air. Police said the girl was hospitalized in critical, but stable condition. The driver in the crash remained on scene. No charges were immediately filed.
