Just when you thought Florida’s housing market couldn’t get any scarier. A worker putting the finishing touches on a new Fort Myers-area home this month discovered a gigantic 12-foot alligator loitering in the master bedroom, according to the Miami Herald. A window blind installer spotted the reptile and hastily called professional trappers to remove it. Video taken at the residence in Babcock Ranch — where houses fetch upwards of $1.5 million apiece — show two men straining to yank the gator out of the home with a rope. The agitated reptile can be seen rolling over several times during the struggle before finally being removed. Project manager Matthew Goodwin told McClatchy News that the alligator was likely looking for some indoor warmth during a stretch of cold weather and became trapped. Goodwin said the reptile made sure to sample every nook and cranny in the home before settling on the master bedroom. “He went into every room and his mark,” Goodwin said, according to the outlet.
