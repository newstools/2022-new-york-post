It just became tougher to run against the Giants. The Giants agreed to terms Wednesday on a one-year deal with defensive tackle Justin Ellis, who is reunited with defensive coordinator Wink Martindale and softens the blow of losing Austin Johnson to the Chargers. Ellis spent the past three years of an eight-year career with Martindale’s Ravens. Ellis, 31, was rated as high as the No. 11 interior defender by Pro Football in 2019 but slipped to No. 85 last season. It is the fourth straight one-year contract for the former fourth-round pick. The Giants replaced defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson (signed for two years, $21 million with the Vikings in 2021) by moving Johnson into a starter’s role. Johnson exceeded expectations (3.5 sacks) and landed a surprise two-year, $14 million deal this month. The 6-foot-2, 350-pound Ellis becomes the heaviest player on the Giants roster. He is a two-down run-stuffer with virtually no pass-rush playmaking, accounting for a half-sack in his career. He has made 50 starts in 100 career games.
