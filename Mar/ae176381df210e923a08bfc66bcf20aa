An Amazon employee apparently became trapped by robot shelves when he was working on the warehouse floor. The employee shared the experience on TikTok under the username Robotman77 and the video has gained over 700,000 views. “The robots at work trap me…it took me like 15 minutes to get out,” the TikToker wrote with the text overlay. The video shows him walking around the warehouse as shelves get moved in his path. “They tried to block me in. These pods are messing with me,” he says in the video as one of the shelves moves once again. As described in the video, the yellow plastic robots created a maze, making it hard for the worker to get through the floor and work between stations. The video gained over 1,000 comments with many viewers commenting why the employee was on the floor in the first place. However, others assured them that the user was allowed to be there. Other viewers were taken aback by the Amazon robots, with one calling them “a true horror movie” and another worrying that the amount of pods “sounds like a fire hazard. Others, however, began making jokes in the comments section. “Five Nights at Amazon,” wrote one user. “Bro boutta [sic] find the tri wizard cup in there,” wrote another, comparing the situation to the Harry Potter movies. Another user said it reminded them of the dystopian franchise, The Maze Runner. Amazon did not immediately return The Sun’s request for comment.
