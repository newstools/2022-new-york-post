A Bronx school was evacuated Friday morning when an anonymous caller phoned in a bomb threat, cops said. The caller rang PS/MS 20, located on Webster Avenue near East Mosholu Parkway North in Norwood around 8:50 a.m., police said. The threat prompted the school to evacuate — but it was deemed not credible and the students were allowed back inside just under two hours later, police said. State Senator Jamaal T. Bailey, who represents the area, said in a tweet that his office has been in contact with the Department of Education. “Emergency units completed an investigation and no bomb was found,” he wrote. “Children & staff are safe and on their way back to the building. Social workers will assist anyone in need of support.”
