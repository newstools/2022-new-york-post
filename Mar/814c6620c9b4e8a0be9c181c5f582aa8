Alexandra Davis, a 25-year-old Congressional aide, is suing Jerry Jones, alleging the Dallas Cowboys owner is her biological father. The lawsuit was obtained by the Dallas Morning News. According to the suit, in the mid-1990’s, Davis’ mother, Cynthia Davis, reached a confidential settlement with Jones that stipulated he would financially support the mother and daughter as long as he was never publicly identified as Alexandra’s father. Alexandra, a 1-year-old when the settlement occurred, is suing to not be legally bound by that stipulation. It is not clear why she filed the lawsuit now. The lawsuit says that Cynthia Davis was a married desk agent for American Airlines in Little Rock, Ark. when she met Jones. Her marriage dissolved and her ex-husband was determined via a paternity test not to be the father. Jones, who has been married since 1963, allegedly “pursued” Cynthia Davis. According to the suit, he ultimately provided $27,000 to help with her divorce and $30,000 in cash during negotiations, and later a $375,000 lump sum. He also allegedly agreed to provide Alexandra Davis with “certain monthly, annual and special funding” through trusts until she turned 21, and then three more payments throughout her 20s. The lawsuit says that the only relationship Jones has had with Alexandra Davis has been to “shun” her and that they have never met. According to Davis’ LinkedIn profile, she works for U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, a Republican from Amarillo, Texas. The lawsuit is temporarily sealed until the end of the month, when there is a hearing scheduled. It was obtained by the Dallas Morning News prior to being sealed.
