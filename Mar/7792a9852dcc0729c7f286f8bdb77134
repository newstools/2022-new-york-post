Leonard Fournette is sticking with Tom Brady over the legendary quarterback’s former team. The talented running back has agreed to return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on a three-year, $21 million deal that could be worth up to $24 million with incentives, according to multiple reports. Per the initial report from Jordan Schultz, the deal has $11 million in guaranteed money for the 27-year-old. Fournette’s decision was likely influenced by Tom Brady’s return as the Buccaneers try to bring the band back together for another Super Bowl. Fournette earned the nickname “Playoff Lenny” for his inspired play during the Bucs’ championship run two seasons ago. On Monday, reports surfaced that Fournette visited the New England Patriots in the slow-moving running back market. Less than 24 hours later, Fournette decided to go back to Tampa Bay on a rather lucrative deal for a running back going into his sixth year. Coming off of one of his best seasons as a pro, the multi-purpose back was third in the high-powered offense in receptions behind Chris Godwin and Mike Evans.
