Dick Vitale is starting March Madness in style. The ESPN college basketball commentator, who has been battling lymphoma, announced Tuesday that a scan from earlier in the day revealed he was cancer-free. “OMG ALL THE PRAYERS many of u have sent have been answered as DR Brown who heads my cancer TEAM  called & said PET SCAN came back that NO CANCER is showing,” Vitale tweeted. “I feel like a coach playing for the Final 4 has a PTPer hit a shot at buzzer. My MARCH MADNESS starts with a W baby !” The 82-year-old revealed in October he had been diagnosed with lymphoma, only months after he was diagnosed with melanoma. A surgery last summer removed the melanoma, but the lymphoma required steroids and six months of chemotherapy. Vitale’s iconic voice has been mostly missing from ESPN broadcasts this season. He announced in January that he had to shut his season down early to rest his throat and voice before undergoing vocal chord surgery in February to treat dysplasia. Vitale did call a game between game Gonzaga and UCLA in November. Along the way, Vitale has kept the public updated with his cancer battle through social media while expressing his hope to return to the sideline next season.
