Knopf executive editor Jenny Jackson’s debut novel, “Pineapple Street,” is about how three sisters handle the trappings of inherited wealth. The book is now being made into a TV series. Now Jackson (who also edits some of today’s top novelists, and our favorites, like Emily St. John Mandel) and her husband, producer Torrey Liddell are leaving their actual Pineapple Street home for nearby Brooklyn Heights digs. The couple just bought a $4.2 million condo on Poplar Street, according to property records. That’s less than the seller, Tora Fisher, of the Fisher Brothers real estate family, and her husband, real estate exec/broker Louis Buckworth, paid when they bought it for $4.31 million in 2017, The four-bedroom, 3½-bath corner condo is in a landmarked boutique building. At 2,455 square feet, it features 550 square feet of outdoor space, oversize windows, high ceilings and hardwood floors. The home opens to an entry gallery that leads to an open living/dining great room space with a gas fireplace. There’s also an open chef’s kitchen that leads to a landscaped wrap terrace with a grill and water/gas hookup. The main bedroom suite has its own wing and comes with a spa-like ensuite bathroom and a second private terrace. The listing broker was Hannah Bomze of Casa Blanca Real Estate.
