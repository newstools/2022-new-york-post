Mike Tyson stayed uncharacteristically cool and hugged it out with a man with a gun who accosted him at a comedy show in Hollywood and challenged him to a fight. The 55-year-old former heavyweight champ was in attendance at the Tuesday night show on a rooftop bar when an audience member began heckling him, footage obtained by TMZ shows. The man could be heard pressing the perplexed pugilist to fight so he could “upgrade” his “status.” “All I need is you. All I need is you,” the man is heard saying to a seated Tyson before the show’s host shoves him away. The man then pulled out a gun from his waist, sending people fleeing and ducking for cover. But Tyson remained calm during the frightening incident, spread out his bulging arms and gave the man a bear hug. The man also asked Tyson not to call the cops, TMZ reported. The LAPD told the outlet that it had not been called about the terrifying encounter.
