The homeless man who admitted to fatally shoving Michelle Go into an oncoming train at the Times Square subway station is mentally unfit to stand trial, a court official said Tuesday. The official said in Manhattan Supreme Court that psychiatrists at Bellevue Hospital made the determination about Martial Simon after a medical evaluation. Simon, 61, has been held at Bellevue in Manhattan since his arrest on murder charges in Go’s Jan. 9 death. He did not appear in court on Tuesday. Prosecutors allege that Simon walked up behind Go around 9:40 a.m. while she waited to board an R train at the station and randomly pushed her into the path of an oncoming train. Simon, who served two stints in state prison for robbery and attempted robbery, has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and has cycled in and out of mental hospitals for more than 20 years, according to family members. Prosecutors requested two weeks to review Simon’s mental-health evaluation, but his attorney Mitchell Schulman expects Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office will “confirm” the findings, meaning Simon would be locked up at a mental health hospital. Jo-Ann Yoo of the Asian American Federation said she hopes Go’s death and Simon’s unfitness to stand trial light a fire under the city’s effort to aid the mentally ill. “Our heart goes out to Michelle Go’s family for the trauma they have to relive as this case makes its way through the legal system,” Yoo said in a statement. “This case, and so many others that involve mentally ill perpetrators, only reinforces the urgent and immediate need for our City’s elected leaders to increase their investment in mental health resources for all communities of color.”
