Sony PlayStation reported outages in its network early on Wednesday morning, sparking a social media panic among gamers. The outage affected the PS Store, PS Now cloud gaming services, and games that rely on a network connection. The problems started at around 8:30 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, according to the PlayStation status page. The outage isn’t affecting everyone, as gamers based in the Midwestern United States and Canada appear to have no difficult accessing their systems while users in New York are reporting error messages, according to The Verge. “We are conducting an investigation and restoration work, so please wait for a while,” read a message posted to PlayStation’s official Twitter account in Japanese. Sony recently released updates for its PS5 and PS4 game consoles, but it is unclear whether the updates are related to the outages. The Post has reached out to Sony seeking comment.
