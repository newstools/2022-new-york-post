Midweek FA Cup action will dominate the footballing headlines in England, but there is one Premier League game to be played — and it’s an important one. Burnley will host Leicester City as the Clarets continue to climb up the table following a string of positive results. Sean Dyche’s squad has two wins and a draw in its last three, allowing Burnley to escape from the bottom of the EPL. It’s hard to take a team in this fixture as Burnley has been steadily improving while Leicester is a bit of an unknown ahead of this contest. The return of a few players will be useful, but this is a confident Burnley side that has found a result in each of its last four home games. What has been consistent with these teams — at least in the Premier League — is limited chances. Six of Burnley’s last seven league games have had two or fewer goals, while five have had fewer than 2.5 expected goals (xG). Just two of Leicester’s five Premier League games in 2022 have had fewer than two goals or xG, but the Foxes have generated just 1.32 xG/game away from the King Power Stadium throughout the year. Because of that, I’m comfortable paying the very slight juice on the Under with a cagey affair very likely as both squads seek a crucial result. The play: Burnley-Leicester City Under 2.5 goals (-115)
