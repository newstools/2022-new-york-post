President Biden insisted that NATO must remain united in its response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as he met Saturday with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw. “Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to divide NATO, but he hasn’t been able to do it,” Biden told Duda across a long conference table packed with officials of both governments “That’s why it’s so important that Poland and the United States keep in lockstep,” he added. Duda has been pushing NATO to provide additional arms, including anti-tank missiles, to Ukraine’s military forces – and has proposed a plan to send its own fighter jets to Ukraine in exchange for American planes, an idea that Biden has rejected. “America’s ability to meet its role in other parts of the world rests upon a united Europe,” Biden declared. “Instability in Europe always comes back to haunt the United States.” Biden is wrapping up a three-day diplomatic mission to Europe as Russia’s assault on Ukraine enters its second month. His brief remarks acknowledged Poland’s key role in sheltering many of the 3.7 million civilians who have fled Russia’s attack on Ukrainian population centers — with a mention of his administration’s own border crisis. “We have on our southern border thousands of people a day — literally,  not figuratively — trying to get into the United States,” Biden said. “But we feel we have to do our part,” he said, referring to the White House plan, announced Thursday, to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians to the US. Thousands are already on their way to the US-Mexico border to claim asylum, according to reports.
