But signs are simply an illogical tool to connect unrelated events, a faulty device to make sense of the senseless. There are no signs that spell danger for what lies ahead.

Entering the Big Ten Tournament off a near-upset of Purdue, the Hoosiers burned countless bettors — sorry, I’ll get over it — with their improbable comeback win against Michigan, holding the Wolverines to 28 points in the second half. With an NCAA Tournament berth potentially at stake, Indiana’s defense will be the key to putting the Hoosiers in position to avenge an earlier home loss to Illinois, as it did against Michigan.
