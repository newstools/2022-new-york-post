A Florida woman was charged with murdering her boyfriend after allegedly mowing him down with her car over the weekend in Alabama, a report said. Johana Suarez is accused of intentionally striking Henry Hernandez as he was walking along Interstate 10 in Mobile at about 5 a.m. Sunday, authorities told Fox 10 News. The duo had gotten into an argument after setting off in the wrong direction on the interstate following an overnight stay in Mississippi, the report said. Hernandez exited the car with his belongings and Suarez initially drove off — before circling back and allegedly ramming head on into her boyfriend. He died at the scene. A passerby called 911 and Suarez was still at the crash site when deputies arrived. She was arrested and charged with murder.
