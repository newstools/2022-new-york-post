This deal is written in the stars — and music to our ears, but not for long. For those who love streaming both music and shows, this package deal from Amazon is for you. For a very limited time — midnight EST on March 2 — Prime members and new subscribers to both Amazon Music Unlimited and Starz can get their memberships for $0.99 for three months. The under-a-dollar membership gives you access to both services, unlocking over 90 million songs without pesky ad breaks, plus podcasts and playlists with the unlimited package. On the Starz side, you get unlimited hours of HD streaming and downloads, plus access to original series, movies and more. While the streaming is endless, this deal is not. We recommend you subscribe right now before the clock hits 12 to get in on this discount, and have a dollar at the ready. Plus, be sure your Amazon Prime membership is active, as this is only available to Prime users. Should you choose to stay subscribed to the services after three months are up, Amazon Music Unlimited costs $9.99 per month and Starz at $8.99. However, Amazon Prime Members can get Amazon Music Unlimited at a discounted rate of $7.99 per month, plus all of the perks you get with a Prime membership like 2-day shipping and exclusive savings.
