Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training action on Friday: Kyle Higashioka homered twice in a 6-5 loss to the Phillies at BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater, Fla., but he seemed more bothered by miscues he made behind the plate, including a passed ball and a wild pitch with Luis Severino on the mound. MLB will begin cracking down on pitchers using illegal foreign substances, a source confirmed, after spin rates increased in the latter part of last season. They had dropped precipitously following the initial enforcement of the rule. We’ll see how it impacts pitchers such as Gerrit Cole and Aroldis Chapman. Tim Locastro, looking to win a spot as an extra outfielder, showed what he can bring to a roster. He singled and stole second base and made an excellent catch before running into the wall in right. He has recovered from the torn ACL that ended his season while with the Yankees last season. The Yankees play host to the Blue Jays at 1:05 p.m. at Steinbrenner Field with Michael King on the mound. He’s slated to go up against Toronto’s Alek Monoah, who struck out seven in three perfect innings against the Yankees in an outing last spring.
