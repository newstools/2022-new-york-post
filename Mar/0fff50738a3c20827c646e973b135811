Genes can play a big part in maintaining a youthful appearance as we grow older. But according to one 50-year-old, her age-defying looks are all thanks to hard work and investment. Anna Maria, who is from the US, took to TikTok and posted a video alongside a caption which read: “Yes I’m 50 years young & have never felt better! Don’t wait till it’s too late to start looking after your body!” In the short clip, she explains: “When people say ‘you’re so lucky to look so good for 50.'” “Me: Luck’s got little to do with it!” The video then shows snippets of Anna Maria’s very healthy lifestyle – including a breakfast bowl of superfoods, fruit smoothies and gym trips. She can also be seen flaunting her svelte figure and youthful face in a one-shouldered red sequin dress and posing in the mirror taking selfies. And many were quick to take to the comments section in response to the video. “Wow! You look amazing,” praised one, while a second enthused: “Exactly, nothing comes from nowhere.” A third commented: “This is what a real influencer looks like,” while a fourth added: “Working hard every damn day.” However, not everyone was quite as complimentary. “You’ve also had work done. Which is fine but don’t make women think this is all-natural,” snapped one. In response, Anna Maria wrote: “Thank you for commenting, what work do you think I’ve had done? My point in this video is that I’ve invested in myself and it’s not just luck.” Another asked: “What is it about women always trying to by 20-years-old,” to which Anna Marie quipped: “I’m not trying to be anything. I’m just me.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
