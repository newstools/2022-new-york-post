NFL free agency officially arrives Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, when any contracts negotiated the two days prior are allowed to be signed. The reporting and anticipation will be breathless as marquee players move from one team to another, agents cajole millions of dollars out of general managers and owners and record-setting contracts are inked one day and surpassed the next. Thus far, the Giants’ additions — backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor and offensive linemen Mark Glowinski and Jon Feliciano — appear to be modest, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing considering the whole free agency exercise is more eye candy than foundation-building.
