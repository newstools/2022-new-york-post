Deshaun Watson will not face criminal charges related to nine allegations of sexual misconduct from massage therapists, a Harris County, Texas grand jury decided on Friday. Watson was accused of touching therapists’ hands with his penis, exposing himself and several claims of sexual assault. “When you stand on the TRUTH, the LORD will FREE you!” the Texans QB tweeted Friday evening with the praying hands emoji. Watson still faces civil lawsuits from 22 massage therapists who are accusing him of sexual misconduct, but criminal proceedings against him have now concluded. “We are delighted that the grand jury has looked at the matter thoroughly and reached the same conclusion we did,” Watson’s attorney Rusty Hardin said in a statement. “Deshaun Watson did not commit any crimes and is not guilty of any offenses. Now that the criminal investigations have been completed, we are happy to move forward with the civil case depositions. We will vigorously defend those cases with every ounce we have. “It is time to let Deshaun move on.” While the grand jury deliberated Friday, Watson sat for two depositions as part of the 22 civil complaints and pled the Fifth Amendment — the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination — to all questions. Watson has denied wrongdoing in the allegations. Hardin has said that the sexual acts described by massage therapists were consensual. The Athletic reported the NFL’s personal conduct investigation into Watson also remains open, and that the league has spoken to 10 of his accusers but not yet to Watson. The 26-year-old missed all of last season as myriad allegations mounted and the team kept him inactive. Before the allegations came to light, the star quarterback had informed the Texans that he no longer wished to play for the organization. With criminal charges no longer looming, Watson’s trade market is expected to pick up rapidly.
