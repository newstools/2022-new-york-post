Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tore into President Biden on Wednesday, describing him as the “Kurt Cobain of politics” and making a gruesome reference to the late rocker’s suicide. “Everything bad that has happened over the last 14 months is a completely self-inflicted wound,” Shapiro said on his eponymous Daily Wire show in response to Biden’s State of the Union address. “Joe Biden is the Kurt Cobain of politics,” Shapiro added. “He put a shotgun in the mouth of the American body politic and then pulled the trigger. And the brains are on the wall.” Nirvana frontman Cobain killed himself in his Seattle home in 1994. He was 27. Later in the same rant, Shapiro said Biden has “had the worst 14 months of any president of the United States ever” and is “so bad at this.” In his annual address to Congress Tuesday, Biden condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, vowed to fight inflation by lowering the cost of goods, and declared the US is in a “new moment” in the COVID-19 pandemic. Shapiro did not mince words during Biden’s actual speech, either, tweeting at one point: “Trash fire of a president giving a trash fire State of the Union because under him, the state of our union is a trash fire.”
