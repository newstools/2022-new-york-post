Butler will look to play spoiler against a Xavier squad that is trending in the wrong direction at the wrong time of the year. Having lost seven of their last 10, Xavier is floundering heading into tournament season, but a run in the Big East tourney would go a long way in getting back on track.  Gametime: 4:30 p.m. EST TV: FS1 Live Stream: ESPN App, FuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Under Travis Steele, the Musketeers are 1-3 in the Big East Tournament and have lost back-to-back first-round games as the higher seed, including last year’s upset to Butler. For the second straight year, Xavier is experiencing a late-season meltdown, losing five straight games before being gifted a game against Georgetown. Some might believe Xavier’s bubble status provides unmatched motivation. But for a free-falling team, it is more likely to produce pressure against the carefree Bulldogs, who lost by two at Xavier just two weeks ago.
