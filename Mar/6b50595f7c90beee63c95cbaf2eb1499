There’s never a dull moment in the world of Antonio Brown. Over the weekend, the free agent wide receiver posted a photo on his Instagram story of himself in bed with model and music producer Cydney Christine. This would not have been so astonishing, but later on Sunday Brown posted an alleged DM exchange with Christine — who has previously been linked to NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson — in which he threatened to “expose” her if she did not return $5,000 to him. “Please don’t do that to me,” Christine allegedly asked Brown, presumably in response to his posting of the photo of the two of them in bed. “I’m really sorry. I just don’t like the way you were talking to me. This isn’t gonna help anything. What can I do to fix it?” Brown had a terse response. “Send me my money bitch,” he wrote. “5k or u be exposed.” After the model allegedly responded that she would send the money through PayPal, Brown wrote, “Hoe u know stop playing with me bitch im a show u This time.” Christine allegedly responded that she was trying to send the money back to him. “I can’t control the past. Gotta do better next time,” Christene wrote on an Instagram Story on Monday. Brown spent most of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, before exiting the field — and the team — shirtless during a Week 17 game against the Jets at MetLife Stadium. This offseason, he has indicated he would like to play for the Ravens or Cowboys.
