A would-be thief at a Manhattan Duane Reade used a hypodermic needle to try to stab the security guard who foiled the attempted robbery last weekend, police said. The suspect was caught on camera shoving items from the store’s refrigerated section into a shopping bag at the location on East 34 Street near Third Avenue in Murray Hill at about 10:15 a.m. Saturday, the NYPD said. When the man tried to flee with the stolen goods, he was approached by the security guard and the two got into a struggle, police said. At one point during the confrontation, the suspect pulled out the needle and tried to stab the worker, according to cops. The clash continued on for a brief time before the suspect left the store empty-handed, police said. He remained in the wind as of early Wednesday. The security guard suffered pain to his left hand, but refused medical attention.
