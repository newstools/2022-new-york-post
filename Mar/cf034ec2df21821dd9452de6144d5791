Trevor Story is going to the AL East, but not to the Yankees. The rival Red Sox agreed to a six-year, $140 million deal with Story on Sunday, The Post’s Joel Sherman confirmed. Story, 29, was one of the top MLB free agents left on the market. While Story has an opt-out after the fourth year, the Red Sox can negate that by picking up a seventh-year option to take the total deal to $160 million. Story played six seasons for the Rockies, which included back-to-back All-Star nods in 2018 and ’19. In 2021, the shortstop hit .251 with 24 home runs, 75 RBIs, 20 steals and an .801 OPS in 142 games. In 375 career games at Coors Field, Story put up a slash line of .303/.369/.972 with 95 home runs, while in in 370 road games he owns a .241/.310/.442 slash line with 63 home runs. The Yankees filled their shortstop void with Isiah Kiner-Falefa, acquiring him and Josh Donaldson last week in a trade with the Twins, who received Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela in the deal. Story seems poised to play second base in Boston with Xander Bogaerts at shortstop for the Red Sox.
