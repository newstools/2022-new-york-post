Cooler heads have prevailed. After a contentious split last year, Vanessa Bryant, the widow of Kobe Bryant, and Nike have renewed the partnership for Kobe’s shoes. “We’re excited to announce our partnership with Nike is going to continue!” she wrote on Instagram Thursday. “I am so proud that my husband’s shoes are still the most worn by players on NBA courts and that the demand for his shoes remain so desired by his fans around the world.” Bryant said that Nike will donate 100 percent of the proceeds from her late daughter Gianna’s shoes to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation. “I am also grateful that Nike and I will work together to establish a youth basketball center in Southern California that will share the Mamba Mentality with youth athletes for generations to come,” her Instagram post continued. “I know this is an inspiring moment for my husband and daughter’s global fans, and I am very appreciative of each and every one of you!” Vanessa Bryant severed the relationship with Nike last April, saying in part that she “was hoping to forge a lifelong partnership with Nike that reflects my husband’s legacy.” ESPN reported that she had been frustrated over a lack of products after her husband’s death, including shoes in children’s sizes. She had previously vented that Nike’s Kobe 6 Protro “Grinch” immediately sold out after she had expressed concern on whether enough of the products would be available.
