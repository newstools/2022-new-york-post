The Biden administration on Thursday extended Temporary Protected Status to Ukrainians living in the US, meaning they won’t have to return to their war-torn nation after 1 million civilians fled Russia’s invasion. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the decision following a Cabinet meeting at the White House with President Biden. “Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Mayorkas said. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.” About 30,000 people living in the US as of March 1 are believed to be eligible for the status, which will last for at least 18 months. The change follows pressure from several members of Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “I applaud President Biden for taking decisive action so that Ukrainians can stay safely in America,” Schumer said. The Department of Homeland Security said the Russian invasion of Ukraine “marks the largest conventional military action in Europe since World War II” and “has caused a humanitarian crisis with significant numbers of individuals fleeing and damage to civilian infrastructure that has left many without electricity or water or access to food, basic supplies, shelter, and emergency medical services.” Get the latest updates in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with The Post’s live coverage. TPS means that eligible people can remain temporarily in the US even if their visas expire. The special status already benefits citizens of a dozen countries that have experienced civil strife or natural disasters, such as Haiti, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. Biden on Thursday announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs in response to the invasion – while he continued to resist pressure to block exports of Russian oil and gas.
