Matty Ice is moving on. The Falcons traded longtime quarterback Matt Ryan to the Colts on Monday after 14 seasons in Atlanta. Following the news of yet another blockbuster spin on the NFL’s quarterback carousel, Ryan’s wife Sarah, expressed her gratitude for the organization and the city they’ve called home for his entire NFL career. “I’m not crying, you’re crying,” Sarah tweeted alongside a Ryan tribute video from the Falcons. “Forever thankful to this team, fan base and city!” Sarah, who has been married to Ryan since 2011 and shares twin sons with the quarterback, also celebrated her husband’s new team by sharing a gif of the Colts’ mascot, Blue. Throughout the day Monday, Sarah also posted sincere messages on her Instagram Story from loved ones, who congratulated the Ryans on their next move. Kelly Stafford, the wife of Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and a close friend, celebrated the Colts’ gain. “Let’s f–king goooooo!! Although damnit they are gonna be so damn good now!” Stafford posted on her Instagram Story, adding, “Prayers to the falcons.” The Falcons selected Ryan No. 3 overall in 2008. He is a four-time Pro Bowler and was named the league’s MVP in 2016. In 17 games last season, he threw for 3,968 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Atlanta had been the mix for Deshaun Watson’s services up until last week, when the Browns stunned the league by trading for the estranged Texans quarterback. Cleveland offered Watson a five-year, $230 million deal, fully guaranteed. The Colts, meanwhile, had been in the market for a quarterback after sending Carson Wentz to the Commanders earlier this month. The former Eagles quarterback had spent one season in Indianapolis.
