Police released crystal clear security footage of two accused killers wanted for killing a Brooklyn man last week. A man wearing a red shirt and black pants, and a man wearing a white undershirt, black pants, sandals and a black winter hat were caught on camera running from an East Flatbush murder scene on March 19, according to the NYPD. The suspects had allegedly attacked Kyle Lewis, 25, in front of 800 East 92 Street just after 1 p.m., police said. One of the men beat up Lewis while the other shot him multiple times in the leg and stomach, authorities said. Lewis died from his injuries at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center.
