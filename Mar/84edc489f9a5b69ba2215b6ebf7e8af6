No, this is not something from a Harry Potter movie. A group of British nerds claim to have created a mind-blowing invisibility shield to “surprise friends” and “avoid enemies”. The shield is essentially a flat panel that magically hides whoever ducks behind it. Even more impressive is the fact the device doesn’t need any power. It cleverly works by deflecting light around people using a “precision engineered lens array,” creators Invisibility Shield Co say. But it’s not completely perfect — you don’t get a clear picture of the scene behind the subject, instead it creates more of a blur. So far, they’ve made 25 fully functional invisibility shields. But now the team are crowdfunding on Kickstarter to turn their invention from “science fiction into reality”. Their goal of raising $6,600 has already been passed, with more than $10,100 pledged so far. Those who offer $395 can get hold of a full-size shield measuring 37.4in x 25.5in, and should receive it by the end of the year. A smaller piece ideal for hiding everyday items is available from $65. Inventors have also said that the clothes you wear can impact the shield’s effectiveness. “The shield performs at its absolute best when the clothing you are wearing is the same color and slightly lighter or equal to the brightness of the background scenery,” they explain. “The shield still works very well with dark and differently colored clothing against a light background, but this combination makes the face of the shield slightly darker overall relative to the background, than it would be if the holder were wearing light clothing.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
