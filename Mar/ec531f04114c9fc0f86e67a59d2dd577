Paulina Gretzky’s bachelorette party may be over, but the epic event has been forever immortalized on social media. In a new video shared Thursday on Instagram, the future Mrs. Dustin Johnson gave her followers an inside look at the lavish bash in St. Barts, which took place last weekend. In the clip, which clocks in at about 30 seconds, Gretzky, 33 — clad in a strapless white mini dress — is first seen departing a jet with her bridal party, who are all seen wearing shades of pink. As the video continues, Gretzky is seen toasting with her nearest and dearest during dinner before dancing the night away. Johnson, 37, who has been engaged to Gretzky since 2013, is also seen in the clip doing a backflip off of a boat. Gretzky invited family and close friends to her bachelorette party, including future sister-in-law Samantha Maddox, who is married to Johnson’s brother Austin, and BFF Kristina Melnichenko, the co-founder of custom hat e-tailer, CaviiLou. On Wednesday, Melnichenko shared a collection of photos from the bash on Instagram, dubbing the event, “Ps Last D.” This week, Melnichenko joined Gretzky in New York, along with Maddox and pal Jeremy Cohen, as wedding preparations continued. Gretzky and Johnson, who are also parents to sons Tatum, 7, and River, 4, are expected to tie the knot at Blackberry Farm, a lavish resort in Walland, Tennessee. Gretzky will wear a Vera Wang creation for the big day, as she previously praised the designer for crafting the “wedding dress of dreams.”
