The performance apparel company lululemon, known for their buttery soft leggings and We Made Too Much offerings, is expanding its reach. Today, March 22, lululemon brings their first-ever footwear collection to stores — and it’s made for women first. “We intentionally started with women first because… more often than not, performance shoes are designed for men and then adapted for women,” said Sun Choe, lululemon’s Chief Product Officer in a press release. “That didn’t sit well with us.” Choe has a point, as women’s athletic shoes are typically designed for men and simply shrunken down for women — which doesn’t always work, as women have a completely different foot morphology than men. But lululemon sought out to change the narrative by applying over 20-plus years of experience designing performance apparel to their new footwear line. Now, women can experience top athletic running shoes made of various upper materials, foam compounds, construction methods and colors. While the brand plans to release a total of four different shoe styles in 2022, such as the Chargefeel, Restfeel and Strongfeel, shoppers can now purchase the lululemon Blissfeel sneaker at lululemon.com and select stores across North America, Mainland China and the United Kingdom. The Blissfeel running shoe was built from scratch, is based on scans of more than one million feet and refined through many rounds of wear-testing. Wearers can look forward to an upper that supports movement, an energy-filled underfoot foam packed with cushioned technology and 10 various color options. lululemon also plans to release a men’s footwear line in 2023 with the same intentionality and insight-driven approach. Because, “When you feel your best, you perform your best,” according to the athletic brand. Want more from lululemon?
