Man bites dog. When Chris “Mad Dog” Russo railed against now-former Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill on Wednesday’s episode of “First Take,” Stephen A. Smith turned the tables on him. Russo had been ripping the wide receiver for chasing “an extra couple dollars” after news broke Wednesday that Hill was on his way out of Kansas City after contract talks between both parties broke down. Hill has since been traded to the Dolphins and signed a lucrative extension, a four-year, $120 million deal with $72.2 million guaranteed. “Why would you sit there and give up this quarterback and that coach with that franchise when they’re in the championship game every year to go sit there with a quarterback that can’t get the ball to you,” Russo barked. Smith, who seemed to know this angle was coming, shot back at Russo for leaving Mike Francesa and the perennially No. 1 radio show in New York City for a few extra dollars at Sirius XM. “I remember this big-time show called ‘Mike and the Mad Dog,'” Smith retorted. “It was an institution. It started sports talk radio. It was doing its thing, OK? While you know something? Mad Dog left! Got his own damn channel! And I’m sure that wasn’t for an extra few bucks okay. So guess what? You made a business decision. What’s wrong with Tyreek Hill doing that?” Russo responded that he was there for 19 years, but given that radio careers last so much longer than football livelihoods, this is relatively proportional to Hill having spent six seasons in Kansas City. It’s not often someone can nail the Mad Dog with a TKO in a sports argument, but this was a powerful uppercut from Smith.
