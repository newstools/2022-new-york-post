For this single mom, three is certainly a crowd. Stephanie Hansen is hitting headlines after giving birth to three babies in the space of a year — and they’re not triplets. The Washington state mama, 32, welcomed her first daughter, Daphne, on Jan. 28, 2020. At the time, Hansen had just embarked on a new romance. She started taking birth control but didn’t think she would be able to get pregnant again so soon. However, the new mom was left stunned when she learned she was expecting twins with her new boyfriend less than three months later. She gave birth to her daughters, Rubie and Penelope, on Dec. 8, 2020. Hansen spoke about raising her three young girls in an interview with Today, saying she initially felt “guilty” when she learned she was pregnant so soon after giving birth to baby Daphne. “I felt awful that she wouldn’t have one-on-one time with me anymore,” Hansen stated. “There was definitely some initial sadness.” However, all anxiety subsided as soon as she welcomed her younger kids, with the mom saying the three siblings are now an inseparable trio. “They are the Three Musketeers,” Hansen cooed. “They’re on the same schedule. They eat, bathe and play together. They share a room.” The single mom is no longer with the father of her twins and admits it can be “chaos” in her household given her single status. However, Hansen clarified that her ex is always on hand to help out with the girls. “When we broke up I was devastated, but I said to myself, ‘I’ve got this. We’re not going to sit around in our pajamas crying,'” she stated. “You can sink or swim.’” Hansen frequently shares TikTok videos about raising her baby girls — now aged 2 and 15 months — and has amassed a fan following. And while she wasn’t expecting her twins, the mom has found out that good things really do come in threes. “I am the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life,” she declared. “These kids are the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
