What happens when you give a retirement gift to a person who decides to unretire? That’s what Peyton Manning wants to know. Manning decided to send Tom Brady a bottle of wine with a two-page letter to congratulate him on his legendary NFL career. That, however, was before Brady unretired fairly quickly in mid-March and announced that he was returning to the Buccaneers. Manning — who told the story at an event hosted by The MINT Collective on Saturday — said he wants the 44-year-old Brady to give him back the gifts. “I want the letter back,” Manning said. “You got to read all these nice things, I want it back. I want the bottle of wine back, too.” Brady recently told foxsports.com the inside details of how he and his team decided to break the news that he wasn’t retiring after all.
