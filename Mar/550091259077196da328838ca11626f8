A robot dog carrying a loudspeaker broadcasted pandemic safety measures in a residential community in eastern China. Video filmed in Shanghai City on March 29 shows the robot dog carrying a loudspeaker broadcasting messages on how to keep safe during the pandemic. The robodog was heard telling residents to “wear a mask, wash hands frequently, check temperature” and more safety instructions. A resident sunbathing nearby said he thought it was a drone but later realized it was a robot dog. He felt it was very fancy as he has never seen it before.
