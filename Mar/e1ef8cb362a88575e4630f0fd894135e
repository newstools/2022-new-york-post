She’s not gonna miss her shot at a long and happy life. Meet Lily Bullen, a spirited grandmother to five and great-grandmother to four, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday by downing shots of tequila around family and friends last month in Worcestershire, England, according to the Mirror. Bullen credits her spunk to the Mexican liquor, affinity toward Domino’s pizza, Greggs sausage rolls and cream cakes as the things that keep her love of live so vibrant, according to the outlet. “She had a surprise birthday party for her 100th birthday, where she did a tequila shot, she also did a Jägerbomb and tequila shot at our wedding in 2013,” Bullen’s 40-year-old granddaughter Holly West said. Beyond her beloved booze, Bullen also loves spending as much time as possible with family, particularly her great-grandchildren. “Her favourite pastime when she can is to watch her great-grandchildren play,” West added, mentioning Bullen’s lasting desire to still try new things in the world. “At the age of 99 the home took Nan ice skating for the first time in her life,” West said. “She loved it.” The fun and family loving Bullen too passed along this advice to live every day to the absolute fullest: “Live one day at a time because tomorrow is never promised.” Even at her age, that philosophy has been reinforced by the state of the world, according to her granddaughter. “The world went into lockdown the week after her birthday. She’s been reminiscing about the Birmingham bombings with the Russia-Ukraine news,” West said. “Her philosophy is to live one day at a time because tomorrow is never promised.”
