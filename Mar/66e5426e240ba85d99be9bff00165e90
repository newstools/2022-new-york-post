Nevertheless, the viability of keeping James Bradberry and Saquon Barkley on the Giants roster remains worthy of examination. Both players are entering the final years of their contracts. Cornerback is widely considered a far more difficult position to fill than running back is. Which player better enhances the Giants’ rebuild? Are either of these players in the team’s plans for 2023? Bradberry’s cap cost of $21.8 million on a team no one outside the building expects can contend for a playoff berth can be viewed as wildly exorbitant. To a lesser degree, the same can be said for Barkley and his $7.2 million cap charge.
