Just when you thought the subways couldn’t get any worse, a man smeared human feces on a woman’s face inside a Bronx station. Newly available video shows the victim, 43,  sitting on a bench Feb. 21 at the Wakefield-241st Street stop (on the No. 2 line, no less); a man walks up to her and, without saying a word, smashes a poop-filled plastic bag in her face, smearing it on the back of her head. Completely unprovoked. As of Monday, the police were still looking for the suspect, who plainly has mental and/or substance-abuse issues. The foul assault may be less frightening than the wave of subway pushings, or the rise in gun and knife attacks, but it all goes to the simple truth voiced by Kevin Young, 36 and the victim of a recent Union Square platform slashing: “Subway crime is out of control.” It’s time to put an end to this crap.
