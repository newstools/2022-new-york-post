The Giants went into free agency needing a tight end, given that they were not going to bring back Evan Engram (he signed with the Jaguars), they had released Kyle Rudolph and also parted ways with Kaden Smith. After those subtractions, they added a player at that position Wednesday night when they agreed to terms with Ricky Seals-Jones, who joins his fifth team in his six-year career. Seals-Jones, 27, has 90 catches for 1,044 yards and 10 touchdowns in 54 games, He has played for the Cardinals, Browns, Chiefs and Washington. In Week 2 last season, Seals-Jones caught a 19-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter in a 30-29 Giants loss at FedExField — a game best (worst?) remembered for Dexter Lawrence getting called for an offside penalty on a missed field goal by Dustin Hopkins in the closing seconds. Given a reprieve, Hopkins then hit the game-winning field goal as time expired. Seals-Jones was a wide receiver at Texas A&M and went undrafted. He had a career-high 34 receptions for the Cardinals in 2018. He had 30 catches last season. At 6-foot-5 and 243 pounds, Seals-Jones is more of a pass-catching tight end than he is a blocker. He played for the Chiefs in 2020 when Mike Kafka, the new Giants offensive coordinator, was the quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator in Kansas City.
