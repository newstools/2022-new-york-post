The Timberwolves are the NBA’s hottest team since the All-Star break with an 11-2 record and a league-best 12.8 Net Rating. The Wolves have been downright dominant on offense, scoring 121.8 points per 100 possessions, and a big part of that is the stellar play of Karl-Anthony Towns, who is averaging 26.8 points on 56 percent shooting along with 10.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game. He will face a favorable matchup against the Mavericks who are lacking bigs after trading Kristaps Porzingis at the trade deadline. This is a Mavericks team that has been solid defensively this season ranking in the top 10, but it should be noted it is just 23rd in opponent field-goal percentage at the rim and allowed Joel Embiid to score 32 points on 11-for-20 (55 percent) shooting in their 111-101 loss on Friday night. The Wolves are fifth in Offensive Rating against top-10 defenses, scoring 111.9 points per 100 possessions and with the Mavs lacking big men, I’m expecting a dominant performance from Towns in this matchup with the rest of the offense maintaining its post-All-Star break form. D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, and Jaden McDaniels have all been solid for this Wolves team, but the biggest difference for Minnesota has been the improvement of its defense. Since the break, the Wolves are fifth in Defensive Rating, holding opposing teams to 109 points per 100 possessions and they’ll be playing a Mavericks team that has slipped offensively over the past two weeks, scoring just 111.4 points per 100 possessions — 25th among NBA teams. The Mavericks make their living from behind the arc where they shoot 40.2 percent of their attempts. The Wolves attempt even more 3-pointers with 42.5 percent of their shots coming from beyond the arc and should be able to match point for point in that area as they’re 12th in 3-point shooting percentage (36.1) while the Mavericks are 22nd (35). My model makes this game a pick ’em and with oddsmakers opening the Wolves at 3.5-point underdogs, I’ll back the hottest team in the NBA to cover and potentially win this game outright. The Play: Timberwolves +3.5 & ML +135
