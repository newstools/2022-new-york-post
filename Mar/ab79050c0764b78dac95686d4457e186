Most Americans think Chris Rock had it coming. More than half of those surveyed in a new poll said the comedian was in the wrong when he joked about Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head at the Oscars — and do not fault actor Will Smith for smacking him on camera. The Blue Rose Research poll found that 52.3% of people blamed Rock for the incident, compared to 47.7% who said Smith was out of line, according to a report published by Mediaite.com on Tuesday. The poll quizzed 2,162 people online about who was “more in the wrong” in the Sunday night spectacle now been seen by millions. While the majority of Americans younger than 65 blamed Rock, nearly 52% of those 65 or older chided Smith for losing his cool on the comedian. Politically, the numbers were fairly even between supporters of President Joe Biden versus former President Donald Trump — 50.8% of Trump supporters blamed Rock while 50.1% of Biden backers said Smith was more at fault. Rock was on stage during the Academy Awards when he pointed out Pinkett Smith, Smith’s wife, and joked that she could star in a sequel to “G.I. Jane,” the 1997 hit flick starring a bald-headed Demi Moore. Smith took exception — his wife has alopecia which prompted her to shave her head last year — and smacked Rock before cursing him out upon returning to his seat. On Monday, Smith issued a public apology, saying he “was out of line and I was wrong.”
