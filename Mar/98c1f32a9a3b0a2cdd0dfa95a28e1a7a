Daylight saving time is just around the corner! Want to ensure you won’t miss out on precious sleep while we gain an hour of sun this spring? Or prevent an accidental and embarrassing oversleeping moment? As we continue to learn the adverse effects of sleeping with your phone, it might be time to invest in an alarm clock. The 21st century has ushered in some seriously cool aids that can keep your sleep hours in check, improving upon things like the clap-on, clap-off switch of the ’80s. Meet the Cloudnola Block Clock! This stylish clock is an aesthetic addition to your nightstand that includes easy and innovative tap control. And right now, it’s on sale for 50% off or just $22.50. The Cloudnola Block Clock is a sleek shape (3.5″ by 3.5″ by 3.5″) with a marble effect that provides a fabulous flair while offering functionality. Put it by your bedside table as a chic alarm clock and marvel at its cool cube form. Need to wake up? You can set alarms for up to three different times, as required, to ensure you don’t oversleep while we have darker mornings this spring. You can also pop the Cloudnola Block Clock in other rooms, like the living room, playroom, or guest room, and add some handy metrics to that space, as well. It includes a triple display which can also provide the date and the temperature, which can go from Fahrenheit to Celsius as needed. Or, if you like to keep things simple, just keep it on the time display. An Auto-off function blends with your surroundings but gives you the time when it hears a noise or when you touch it for a slick, secret agent vibe, which also means it’s an improvement upon the old-school clap-on, clap-off method that we used in the ’80s. Want it to keep providing time, date, and temperature updates longer? Use the USB to plug it in for a longer lifespan. Get through this year’s Daylight Saving Time with help from the Cloudnola Block Clock, just $22.50 for a limited time. Prices subject to change.
