A 74-year-old woman was in critical condition after being hit by a minivan in Williamsburg Thursday night. The victim was struck as she crossed the intersection of Broadway and Roebling Street just before 10:30 p.m., police said. She was fighting for her life at Elmhurst Hospital early Friday morning. The 64-year-old driver stayed on the scene. No charges had been filed on Friday morning as the investigation continued, according to the NYPD. The identity of the victim was not immediately released. The accident took place as a new report said last month marked the deadliest February for traffic deaths in New York City since at least 2008, according to a new report.
