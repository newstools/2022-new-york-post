Versatile American racing driver Danny Ongais died on February 26 of congestive heart complications at age 79, it was announced Monday. Ongais was born in Kahului and remains the only native Hawaiian who has ever competed in the Indy 500. He made 11 starts from 1977 and 1996, earning four top 10 finishes and a fourth-place result in 1979. Ongais became known as “The Flyin’ Hawaiian” as he competed across a number of racing disciplines, including Formula One, sports cars and the NHRA. During the 1981 Indy 500, Ongais survived one of the most dramatic crashes in the race’s history when his car disintegrated after hitting the wall, leaving his legs and arms exposed as it burst into flames and skidded to a stop. He suffered several season-ending injuries, but returned to drive in the race the following year. Ongais’ final Indy 500 came in 1996 when he finished 7th at age 54. He attempted, but failed to qualify again in 1996. Ongais was inducted into the American Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2000 for his success in drag racing, where he won several class championships and the 1969 U.S. Nationals in Funny Car.
