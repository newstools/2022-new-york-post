The Giants’ new returner is making his return. Richie James agreed to terms on a free-agent contract with the Giants, The Post confirmed. The former seventh-round draft pick averaged 7.3 yards per punt return and 23 yards per kickoff return with one touchdown on 47 opportunities over three seasons with the 49ers. The Giants haven’t had a kickoff or punt return for a touchdown since Dwayne Harris scored in both forms in 2015. The 26-year-old receiver/returner missed all of last season after injuring his knee last August and undergoing surgery for the injury. James set career highs with 23 catches for 394 yards in 2020 and offers depth at a position where the Giants’ top four receivers – Kenny Golladay, Sterling Shepard, Darius Slayton and Kadarius Toney – all missed multiple games last season. Toney never materialized as a returner during his rookie season, and the Giants instead relied on C.J. Board (re-signed) and Pharoh Cooper (free agent). The 5-foot-9, 185-pound James is expected to sign a one-year contract for the league minimum ($1.035 million) that will count for $1 million against the salary cap because of the Veteran Salary Benefit clause to promote retaining fringe experienced players in the league.
