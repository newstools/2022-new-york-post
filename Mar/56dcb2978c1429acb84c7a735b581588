Terrifying surveillance video captured the moment a Los Angeles man was fatally shot while walking his dog in an area neighbors described as a “no-crime zone.” Marcos Sandoval and his dog are seen walking near the corner of Genesee Avenue and Saturn Street about 5:30 a.m. Saturday when a car approaches and stops at the intersection, KCAL-TV reported. The driver gets out of the dark sedan, exchanges words with Sandoval and fires at the victim several times before fleeing northbound on Genesee. A passerby discovered Sandoval about 6:15 a.m. and called 911. Sandoval’s dog, Little Torro, is seen in the footage running away after the first shot. The pooch was not injured and made it back home safely, KCAL reported. “He started barking at my sister’s window, the back door, and my sister went out to look for him,” Sandoval’s daughter, who was not named, told the outlet. “When she couldn’t find him, that’s when she called me.”A neighbor who heard the gunfire described the sound of two men arguing loudly shortly before the shooting. “I woke up maybe like 5:30 and heard two men talking loudly, arguing,” she told the outlet on the condition of anonymity, adding that she believed the two men knew each other. “Then my dog and cat woke up and a few minutes — maybe five minutes — went by, then I heard two gunshots. I didn’t know they were gunshots at the time,” the woman added. Sandoval’s daughter described her dad as a “good person” who “had no enemies.” “We don’t know why someone would just target him,” she told KCAL. “He would always put me and my sister first before anyone and it’s just not fair that they just took him away from us like that.” LAPD Lt. John Radtke said police have not established a motive in the shooting. “This is a very quiet neighborhood, no significant crime patterns,” he said. Shocked neighbors described the area as a “no-crime zone.” “We’ve never had anything like that,” Shirley Dionzon, who has lived in the area since 1965, told the outlet.
