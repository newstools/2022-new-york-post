Several CVS executives were fired after an internal investigation found they botched the handling of sexual harassment allegations within company ranks, according to a report. Karen Lynch, the CEO of the pharmacy chain, cleaned house after she was made aware of complaints that a New Jersey regional manager was allegedly harassing and inappropriately touching at least two female employees, the Wall Street Journal reported. The incidents have also prompted Lynch to overhaul the company’s sexual harassment policy, according to the Journal. Shares of CVS were trading lower by just under 0.5% as of Friday afternoon. The New Jersey-based manager oversaw hundreds of CVS locations. According to the Journal, Lynch personally oversaw an investigation into allegations against the manager. After the investigation came to a conclusion in January, Lynch ordered his dismissal as well as several of the manager’s superiors. The people fired weren’t named by the publication. Lynch on Friday informed around 450 senior leaders at the company of the decision. She also revealed that CVS would offer its employees a confidential channel through which they can bring complaints of harassment. “We absolutely do not tolerate behavior or actions that are harassing, hostile, abusive or discriminatory,” CVS said in a statement to The Post. “In late 2021 we received an anonymous report alleging misconduct by one of our field management colleagues. “After a thorough investigation conducted with an outside independent firm, we quickly terminated the individual and others have since been exited from the company for failing to treat allegations with the seriousness we expect.” In 2017, a CVS security worker was busted for allegedly taking shoplifters into a back room of the store and convincing them to strip naked rather than get arrested.
