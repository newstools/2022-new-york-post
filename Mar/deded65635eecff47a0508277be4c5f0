Shocking video shows an armed robber barge into an Upper Manhattan fast food restaurant before snatching a necklace from a customer in front of horrified witnesses. Two suspects pulled up on a motorcycle outside John’s Fried Chicken on West 207 Street in Inwood at about 8:15 p.m. Sunday before one of them entered the store with his gun drawn, according to the newly released footage provided by the NYPD. As the suspect points his gun toward the victim, who was on the floor underneath a ledge, two other diners could be seen in the video cowering in the back corner of the restaurant. One of the customers dashes out with their hands up as the suspect yanks the necklace from the victim, the video shows. Police said the chain has a pendant with the numerals “72”. The armed crook fled the store with the necklace and hopped on the back of the waiting motorcycle before the two sped off towards Sherman Avenue, cops said. The pair were still being sought early Thursday.
