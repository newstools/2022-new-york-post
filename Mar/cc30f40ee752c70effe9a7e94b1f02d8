Paige Spiranac briefly opened up about her relationship status. During an Instagram Q&A on Monday, the golf influencer addressed her past when a fan asked if she is currently married. “I do get this question a lot so I do want to address it. I was married,” Spiranac said. “I am no longer married and if you could just respect my privacy it would mean a lot to me.” Spiranac wed athletic trainer Steven Tinoco in 2018. “I met him at the start of my career, so we have done this entire thing together,” Spiranac told The Post in June 2020. She said at the time that the couple lived a quiet home life, and that Tinoco was supportive of her sultry posts on social media. “He is so understanding and knows this is a business for me. He will say, ‘Hey, show a little more cleavage.’” Spiranac didn’t delve into details Monday about the past relationship. It is unclear when the breakup took place. Spiranac has previously elaborated on her decision to keep her personal life private. “I am so open and honest about everything in my life, as you guys can tell from the podcast, that I want something to myself, and having a public relationship is very difficult, and as soon as you make it public, you’re giving everyone the right to ask questions and you have to then answer them,” she said, according to The Spun. As for Tinoco, he is based in Arizona, per his public Instagram page, which also features golf pics and workout videos.
