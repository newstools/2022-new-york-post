The Fyre Festival is still causing problems five years later, with a company involved in the Netflix documentary about the failed event suing for over $100,000 in unpaid fees and legal costs, new court papers allege. FM2010, LLC says that it provided 16 percent of the footage for the 2019 movie called “FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,” according to a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit from Thursday. But FM2010 says it’s still owed roughly $44,000 in unpaid fees and another roughly $53,000 for the cost of getting dragged into organizer and convicted con artist Billy McFarland’s bankruptcy case, the filing claims. FM2010 is an affiliate of Matte Finish — which shot over 100 hours of film in the Bahamas and New York as part of promotional work it did for the festival and McFarland. FM2010 provided part of that footage to be used in the Netflix film as part of an April 19, 2018, agreement with production companies Exuma Films LLC, Library Films LLC and Jerry Media LLC, the court papers claim. FM2010 says that under the agreement, Exuma said it would legally cover FM2020 if any issues arose from using the footage, the court papers allege. Also, FM2020 was supposed to be paid 16 percent of the profits from the movie, but Exuma stopped sending accounting and  stopped making payments to FM2010 on April 19, 2019, the suit claims. FM2010 says it doesn’t know the full amount it’s owed from the 16 percent profits. And in addition, FM2010 is owed $43,706 for post-production work and legal work, the filing claims. Then in 2019, FM2010 was pulled into a bankruptcy case when it was issued subpoenas  for documents and information. FM2010 settled for $15,000 in the bankruptcy case. FM2010 says Exuma should cover the settlement and the legal fees totaling $53,000, according to the suit. The luxury music festival was slated to take place over two weekends in April and May 2017. McFarland and rapper Ja Rule paired up selling tickets that ranged from $1,200 to $100,000. But instead of posh food and accommodations, attendees were served cold cheese sandwiches and put up in FEMA tents. McFarland is serving a six-year prison term for fraud after he raised millions from ticket sales, much of which he spent on himself and to promote the event, which he ended up canceling.
