Scammer socialite Anna “Delvey” Sorokin has been released from an upstate New York detention center and is being deported from the US after nearly a year in ICE custody, a source exclusively told The Post. She is reportedly set to board a flight to Frankfurt Monday night, sources revealed. Sorokin, 31, is said to be furious about the deportation, according to one close source, as she had put in an appeal to remain in the US. The appeal was meant to be heard on April 19. She has been at the Orange County Correctional Facility in Goshen, NY, since March 25 for allegedly overstaying her visa. She’s reportedly due to appear on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast on Wednesday. Last month, Sorokin — whose life and crimes are glamorized in the Netflix hit “Inventing Anna” — and three other ICE detainees sued federal immigration authorities after getting COVID-19 while in custody. Sorokin tested positive for the virus on Jan. 19, weeks after she submitted a written request for a follow-up vaccine dose that went unanswered, according to the complaint filed in federal court by the ACLU. The plaintiffs claimed that ICE violated their constitutional rights as medically vulnerable people by ignoring their booster requests. Sorokin came to New York City in 2013 to set up a high-end members-only arts club, according to her former defense attorney Todd Spodek, but things spiraled out of control. She claimed to be an heiress named Anna Delvey. In reality, Anna Sorokin was born in Domodedovo, a working-class town southeast of Moscow. Her father, Vadim Sorokin, worked as a truck driver, while her mother owned a small convenience store. The family moved to Germany in 2007, when Sorokin was 16. Sorokin’s best friend Neffatari Davis told The Post that the scammer “has a good heart, but she has a dark, twisted mind.” She ended up swindling new friends and various businesses, including some of NYC’s top hotels, out of $275,000 during a 10-month spree. A Manhattan jury convicted her on one count of attempted grand larceny, three counts of grand larceny and four counts of theft services. She spent nearly four years in prison before being released on good behavior on Feb. 11, 2021. Making her return to the Big Apple, Sorokin bragged on Instagram in March: “They already told you I own this lawless f–king city.” The account also featured photos of her drinking champagne from a claw-foot tub and living it up. “Anna was only out for a few weeks before ICE scooped her up,” Davis told The Post last month. “She was very sarcastic on Instagram … I think they were watching her. “They told her that her visa had expired, but, instead of being deported, Anna — being Anna — said, ‘I’m going to fight this.’ She thought it would be a quick fight. I think if she was a plain Jane and not in the media, she would have just been deported.” Davis feels Sorokin has been punished enough. “She got out on good behavior and she used the money Netflix gave her to pay everybody back, she owes no money,” Davis said. “She’s paid for her crimes, she didn’t kill anyone. She did wrong, but, at the end of the day, there are people who have done worse.”
