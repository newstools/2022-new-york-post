There’s a real showdown in the SEC on Saturday, when Tennessee welcomes Arkansas into Knoxville in a game that features two teams tied for second place in the conference at 13-4. Tennessee has not lost at home all season, and I just don’t see that changing on Saturday. Thompson-Boling Arena will be absolutely rocking, and I expect the Volunteers to shoot it far better than they did two weeks ago in Fayetteville, when they lost to Arkansas, 58-48. Despite losing that matchup, Tennessee won the rebounding battle and forced double-digit Arkansas turnovers. Both of those are repeatable on Saturday, and the Vols’ togetherness on defense should once again give the Razorbacks problems in the half court. Since the calendar turned to 2022, Arkansas has lost exactly one game by more than one point, but despite that, I’m willing to lay the points here and back the Vols at home as a short favorite. I would also endorse Tennessee as a great moneyline parlay piece if you don’t feel comfortable laying the points in what could be another tight game. Rick Barnes has done a heck of a job thus far in his time in Knoxville, and Saturday is an opportunity for his team to make another statement as things heat up in early March. The plays: Tennessee -6.5 and use Tennessee -250 moneyline as a parlay piece
