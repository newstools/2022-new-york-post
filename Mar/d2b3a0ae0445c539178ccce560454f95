The surging Duke Blue Devils will face a Miami Hurricanes squad that will have a hard time keeping up with them with an ACC championship game berth at stake. Gametime: 7:00pm EST TV: ESPN Live Stream: Fox Sports App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV There is just one ACC team the Blue Devils haven’t beaten this season. That changes Friday. After surviving an unexpected sweat against Syracuse, Duke’s young stars will be better prepared for the Hurricanes, who pulled off an upset in Durham this season. Could it happen again? Sure, if one of the best shooting and least-turnover prone teams in the country somehow gives up 15 steals and shoots 6 of 21 from deep again.
