With less than two weeks remaining in the NBA regular season, so much is still up in the air, especially in the Eastern Conference. How will the ever-tightening top four playoff seeds shake out? Where will the Kyrie Irving-boosted Nets be seeded and who will they face in a play-in scenario? Which teams can expect to get the most significant lineup reinforcements before the playoffs begin? Will the Lakers even grab the final play-in spot in the West? What will a strong finish by the Knicks mean for next year? Is there anything left to be decided in the MVP race? The answers aren’t perfectly clear in every situation, but let’s tackle each of these questions this morning… The top four teams in the East are separated by 1 ½ games after the Bucks defeated the 76ers on Tuesday night in Philadelphia to move within a half-game of the first-place Heat in the hotly contested battle for the No. 1 postseason seed in the conference.
