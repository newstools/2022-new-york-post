Anyone needing another reason not to visit New York City got it Monday as an evidently disturbed man sucker-punched a 9-year-old girl from Miami in the head as she walked with her mom near Central Park. Raheem Ramsarran, the 27-year-old suspect, attacked the child around 11:20 a.m.; luckily, Plaza doorman Neil Johnson was there to ensure the assailant didn’t get away before the cops arrived. Before decking the little girl, he was “screaming at people,” says Kimberly Thomas, who was working at a nearby COVID-testing booth. “We saw a man with a backpack, a red hoodie and a beige jacket screaming at people and people literally running away from him and he was just like yelling.” Ramsarran is no stranger to police, of course. Cops answered disturbed-person calls to his Queens residence in 2018 and 2019. He told officers at the time that he wasn’t on medication. Johnson told The Post it seemed “pretty clear” Ramsarran has mental-health issues — and that he’d never seen anything like this attack in his 24 years working at The Plaza. New York City, in short, is doing worse than ever at keeping dangerous madmen off the streets. Rising crime is bad enough; leaving children at risk because politicians refuse to face facts on mental illness is tragically worse.
