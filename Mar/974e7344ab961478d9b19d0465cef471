Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that he believes Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine, citing the reported murder of civilians and shelling of non-military targets by invading forces. “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,” Blinken told reporters. “After all the destruction of the past few weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.” Blinken specifically called out Russian troops for intentionally bombing a theater in the southern city of Mariupol where hundreds of civilians, including children, were sheltering. He also noted a brutal shooting in the northern city of Chernihiv, where Russian forces gunned down at least 10 Ukrainian citizens standing in line for bread. “These incidents join a long list of attacks on civilian, non-military locations across Ukraine, including apartment buildings, public squares and last week, a maternity hospital in Mariupol,” Blinken said. “I doubt that any of us who saw those images will ever forget.”
