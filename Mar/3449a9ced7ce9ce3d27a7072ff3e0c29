Mayor Eric Adams on Sunday night shared a disturbing video that captured the moment two assailants robbed a mother and her baby at gunpoint in a New York City apartment building. Adams used the clip, which he posted to Twitter, to defend the NYPD’s new anti-gun units that he said is being criticized by a “small group of people in” the Big Apple. In the shocking video, a mother can be seen walking a young child down the stairs to the lobby of a residential building as two suspects lay in wait out of sight around a corner. As the mother rounds the corner towards the front door, she is accosted by one of the men who forces her back against the wall with the young child at her side, the video shows. One of the brutes appears to speak to the mother as he holds his hand over her mouth. His accomplice comes over and the two shake her down before the footage cuts out. It was unclear when and where the terrifying crime took place. The NYPD was unable to provide information early Monday morning and City Hall didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Adams launched the first wave of his anti-gun unit squads two weeks ago in 28 areas across New York City where shootings have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams had previously slammed the formation of the new unit — expressing fear it would turn into a replica of the NYPD’s notorious anti-crime unit that was dissolved in 2020. Some locals also had mixed feelings about the new patrols after they hit the streets earlier this month. The mayor’s tweet came after he claimed earlier Sunday that the Big Apple has become a global “ laughing stock” as the city buckles under surging crime and homelessness.
