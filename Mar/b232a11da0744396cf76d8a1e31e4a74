Jonah Keri, who for a time was one of the most prominent baseball writers, was sentenced Wednesday to 21 months in jail for domestic abuse. As documented by CTV News in Montreal, Keri pled guilty to charges last August. At the time, he told the court he was sorry, but admitted this apology was “meaningless” because “the cycle of violence continued.” Keri was arrested in 2019, accused by his then-wife of making death threats and assault causing bodily harm. According to the Montreal Gazette, Keri’s wife said at his sentencing hearing that he assaulted her while she was pregnant, breaking her nose a month before the baby was due. She said that he threatened to kill her and her unborn baby. “Mr. Keri would keep me trapped in the house for days at a time. He isolated me from the people closest to me and I further isolated myself to protect him and, I thought, to protect myself by keeping the abuse secret,” Keri’s ex-wife said. “I completely lost autonomy while I was with him and it has taken a lot of time to rebuild confidence in making my own decisions or to feel safe alone. To this day, I feel compelled to avoid confrontation at any cost, no matter who it is with,” she said, accusing him of being controlling and demanding to know her passwords to various accounts. “Because of Mr. Keri’s actions, I lost myself.” Keri previously covered baseball for a number of national outlets, including The Athletic, CBS Sports and ESPN’s Grantland.
