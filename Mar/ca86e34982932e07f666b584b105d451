Joe Buck is certainly leaving Fox on a high note — literally. The network’s longtime sportscaster, who is joining the “Monday Night Football” booth on ESPN with former Fox colleague Troy Aikman, was revealed to be under the ram mask on Wednesday’s installment of Fox’s “The Masked Singer.” “I feel great. I feel like I came here, did what I wanted to do, I walked out on the stage, I wasn’t nervous, I had fun, so for me, that’s a win,” Buck said post-unmasking. During the episode, Buck — while still wearing his ram mask – performed “Take Me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver and the Foo Fighters’ “Learn to Fly” in front of an audience and panel of celebrity judges, including Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Eric Stonestreet, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. Unfortunately, Buck was eliminated just two episodes into the show’s seventh season. Despite the early exit, the 52-year-old broadcaster said his experience on the competition series was “phenomenal.” “The crew back here, Amy the vocal coach, everybody who got me dressed in this ridiculous thing every day,” he expressed. “When you put this costume on, you immediately feel more powerful and it gives you some confidence, so, to walk out there and sing and be in this costume, I think was really a benefit for me.” Now that he’s officially closed the Fox chapter, Buck can focus on his future at ESPN, where he signed a five-year, $75 million deal, The Post’s Andrew Marchand previously reported. Aikman, meanwhile, inked a five-year, $90 million contract with the network, which will take both him and Buck through 2027, when ABC/ESPN will broadcast the Super Bowl.
