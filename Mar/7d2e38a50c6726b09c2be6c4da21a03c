A Dad has found a 2lb 4oz meteorite worth up to $130,000 in a farmer’s field after searching for it for 18 months. Tony Whilding, 38, of Wrexham, North Wales, began his hunt after a ball of flames shot over his home and went out. Tony is hoping to get the rock certified to find how much it is worth. He said: “I was in my back garden having a midnight cigarette when I noticed the sky lighting up above my head. “I looked up to see a low-flying ball of fire with two swirling trails of smoke. “It got brighter as it approached my house at about twice its height. It was so low you could have kicked a football in the air and it would have reached it. “As it crossed over, it extinguished within a few seconds. There was no noise, it just disappeared, leaving only the trails of smoke.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
