LONDON — Passengers and crew on a British Airways flight to London from Scotland on Monday had quite the adventure as the plane’s tail struck the runway while trying to land during strong winds.The flight had left Aberdeen and attempted to land at Heathrow Airport as Storm Corrie brought howling winds to the UK. The video by Big Jet TV shows the Airbus 321 wobble and leaning to one side over the runway, then the tail dips and strikes the pavement before the pilot aborts the landing and regains altitude. The pilot went around and made a successful landing on the second try, according to the Guardian. No one was injured. British Airways told the media: “Our pilots are highly trained to manage a range of scenarios, including extreme weather conditions, and our flight crew landed the aircraft safely. Our customers and crew all disembarked as normal.” The storm brought winds as high as 92 mph off the coast of Scotland, though the winds were gusting to around 31 mph at Heathrow at the time of the aborted landing.
