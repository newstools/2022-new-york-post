Three anti-abortion activists were found guilty on charges that they blocked women from entering a Westchester County clinic in November, prosecutors announced. Matthew Connelly, 40, William Goodman, 52, and Christopher Moscinski, 52, were found guilty Thursday of misdemeanor criminal trespass after a three-day trial for illegally entering All Women’s Medical in White Plains and refusing to leave for two hours, prosecutors said. The three men, affiliated with the religious group Red Rose Rescue, had to be “physically carried” out of the office after ignoring warnings to leave by medical staff and local cops, the county District Attorney Mimi Rocah said in a news release. One of the men was on the floor, blocking the entrance to the office, while the other two refused to leave the waiting room, according to the release. All three were “physically carried” out of the office, Rocah said. “The District Attorney’s Office will vigorously prosecute any criminal acts that interfere with an individual’s constitutional right to freely access healthcare,” Rocah said in a statement. “There are no insignificant cases when it comes to the protection of reproductive rights.” They’re due for sentencing on June 20.
