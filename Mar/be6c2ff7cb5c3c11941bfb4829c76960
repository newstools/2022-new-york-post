A stunning West Village boutique building — the former home of Gilda’s Club NYC — is on the market for $12.5 million, and ready for prime-time transformation into a single-family mansion. The club was named for “Saturday Night Live” legend Gilda Radner (who died of ovarian cancer in 1989) and was founded in 1995 by her husband, Gene Wilder. It has played host to celebrity volunteers and gala honorees including Vanessa Bayer (also of “SNL”), Mandy Patinkin, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. The organization offered free services to young cancer patients and their families; its focus expanded during the pandemic, and it’s now known as the Red Door Community (an homage to the building’s famous entrance). “It’s been a great space where kids can play and the family can spend time together while experiencing cancer,” says the group’s CEO, Lily Safani. “It’s a unique place, and the sale will help us with our expansion plans.” The four-story, 11,332-square-foot property is at 195 W. Houston St. (outside of the historic district) and can be delivered vacant, say listing brokers Brock Emmetsberger and Marshall Dickson of B6 Real Estate Advisors.
