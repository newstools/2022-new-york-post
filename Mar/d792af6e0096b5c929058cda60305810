Would you pay this Playboy model to try and “honeytrap” your husband? Carolina Lekker is making a fortune off suspicious women who pay her up to $2,000 to slide into their partner’s private messages to see if they’ll be up for an affair. The Barcelona-based beauty, who once graced the cover of Playboy Africa, told the Daily Star she has already made more than $10,000 catching out would-be cheaters. Lekker said she refunds the money to each female customer if their man “passes the loyalty test” by turning her down and refusing to take her bait. “If he doesn’t fall for my chat, I return the money,” the model declared, saying a number of men have not fallen victim to her devious and dirty messages. The Spanish starlet explained her method for trying to catch out a potential cheater, saying: “I contact them first on Instagram and wait for them to respond. I keep making conversation until the conversation gets hotter.” She continued: “If after a lot of talking he wants to meet with me, I get the money and he doesn’t pass the loyalty test.” Lekker has spent the funds from her side hustle on a series of cosmetic procedures, telling The Daily Star: “I had four nose rhinoplasties.” The beauty hit headlines last October when she told the same publication that she had splashed out more than $150,000 on plastic surgery in a bid to have “the most expensive body on Instagram.” In addition to her nose jobs, Lekker has had liposuction, facial harmonization and butt injections. “It’s a different pain, it’s worth it, you know?” the model said of her multiple procedures. While Lekker jumps into unsuspecting men’s private messages on Instagram, she’s not short of men taking their own initiative and getting into contact with her. The beauty boasts 500,000 followers on the social media site, with male fans fawning of her saucy images.
