Puck yeah! Russian-born hockey star Ilya Kovalchuk and his wife, Russian singer Nicole Andrazajtis, have relisted their Alpine, New Jersey, mansion. The couple first put the property at 10 Frick Drive on the market in 2019 for $17.99 million. It is now asking $14.99 million — down from its 2020 ask of $15.99 million. At the same time, the couple just sold one of their two West Coast homes — a contemporary spread in Beverly Hills with LA and ocean views at 1041 N. Hillcrest Road for $12.4 million. The listing brokers were Tomer Fridman and Antonio Bruno of Compass Beverly Hills, who sold the home in a month. (The couple had bought it for $11.2 million in 2020.) We hear the Kovalchuks loved this modern 6,293-square-foot California manse which sits on nearly half an acre and comes with five bedrooms. But they needed something bigger as their four kids continue to grow. In New Jersey, the new construction mansion is much larger: 22,000 square feet, with eight bedrooms, 11 full bathrooms, three powder rooms, a formal living room and a “banquet-size” dining room. There’s also a chef’s kitchen, a prep kitchen, walk-in pantry and wine storage. The Garden State home also boasts a finished basement with a lounge, a theater, a bar and a one-bedroom guest suite. Kovalchuk and Andrazajtis bought the parcel of land — 2 acres — for $4.5 million in 2010 and then built the house when he was playing for the NHL. Kovalchuk, a left winger, played for the New Jersey Devils from 2010 to 2013. He’s now a free agent.
