As the Madness (briefly) subsides, Action Network NBA analyst Joe Dellera is here to give his best bets for Monday’s NBA card (video above). The first contest interesting Dellera is a Western Conference matchup between the Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves, which arrives as a three-point underdog. For Dellera, he believes this is a good spot to ride the red-hot T’Wolves. “The Timberwolves are number two in point differential over the last two weeks,” Dellera says. “And their defense has been absolutely incredible as of late…over the last two weeks they’re allowing just 104.8 points per 100 possessions.” Given the Timberwolves have a better net rating than the Mavericks over the course of the season – Minnesota sits seventh while Dallas sits 10th – Dellera believes there’s no reason it can’t win the game outright. As a result, he’s backing the Wolves spread and sprinkling on its moneyline (+140). For Dellera’s second play, he’s looking to the Lakers-Cavaliers matchup. However, he’s choosing to back a player prop: Evan Mobley over 16.5 points. By going up against a poor lakers defense, Dellera expects Mobley will be a good scoring option in Cleveland. “Over the last two weeks, the Lakers have the fourth-worst adjusted defensive efficiency,” Dellera says. Additionally, the Lakers have not been a good rebounding team of late, turning in a rebounding rate of 47.5 percent over the last two weeks, one of the worst percentages in the association.  Lastly, Dellera says the absence of Jarrett Allen is quite meaningful for this prop. In Mobley’s last 10 games without Allen playing, he’s cleared this benchmark in seven. For those reasons, take the de-facto Cleveland big man over his points total tonight.
