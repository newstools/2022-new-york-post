TV personality Greg Kelly, the Newsmax anchor, and his wife Judith Grey, an advertising creative director, recently bought an Upper East Side home for $5.26 million, according to property records. The stunning co-op is on East 61st Street, a 17-story brick and limestone building dating back to 1951 known as Carlton House. The three-bedroom, 3½-bath unit is 2,371 square feet. It was last asking $5.49 million, down from its original $7.6 million ask in 2013. It comes with a hefty $8,772 monthly maintenance bill. The unit opens to a foyer and leads to an entertaining space overlooking Madison Avenue. There’s a large, windowed eat-in chef’s kitchen, with custom wood and lacquered white cabinets, and a main bedroom suite with a spa-like bathroom. Building interiors are by top interior designer Katherine Newman, of Toronto. Building amenities include a concierge, gym with a pool and treatment rooms, and even a “lifestyle consultant.” The listing brokers are Douglas Elliman’s John Credaroli and Lauren Muss, who declined comment. Last fall, the couple sold their Chelsea home at 263 Ninth Ave., aka the Heywood, for $1.66 million, down from its original $2.25 million asking price in 2017.
