A man reportedly got his girlfriend’s lips tattooed on his face before getting a phone call that made him instantly regret it. A TikTok video posted by Official Feel Good Ink shows the man in a tattoo chair while in the process of getting the face ink. The man sent a text to his girlfriend, showing her the still-in-progress tattoo. “Baby, I got your lips on me forever,” the message reads. Moments after he sent the message, the man’s phone begins to ring. The man believed his girlfriend was calling to say “OMG babe,” he says in the video. But the response he was met with was completely different. “Are you f—-ing stupid or what,” the woman can be heard saying on the phone. “That s–t’s f—ing permanent and on your f—-ing face. “We’ve only been together for two weeks.” At that point in the video, the man tells the tattoo artist: “Hold on bro. Hold on, hold on, hold on.” Then, turning his attention back to his girlfriend on the phone, the man says, “Okay, but I love you.” Warning: Graphic language “That’s crazy, I can’t do this,” the woman is heard saying. “I can’t be with you. Esta loco.” “What the f–k,” the man says. Meanwhile, after the woman delivers the blow, someone off-camera says: “Oooh s–t.” While some users believe the video may have been staged, others aren’t sure what to make of it. “Please tell me this is a prank,” someone commented. “She did not feel the same way clearly,” another user said. “He gonna have a beard pretty soon,” one viewer wrote. “And this is why I will never get a relationship-based tattoo because anything could happen,” another TikToker wrote. The video has been viewed more than 5 million times and hundreds of thousands of people have liked the video. This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
