There’s been some drama in the wake of Vanderbilt’s upset over Alabama in the SEC Tournament. When the Commodores learned they would be playing the Crimson Tide, Scotty Pippen Jr. – a junior guard on Vandy and son of NBA legend Scottie Pippen – expressed excitement. “They’re a very beatable team,” Pippen Jr. said Wednesday. “They’re a team we wanted to play. We’ll see tomorrow.” Vanderbilt defeated Alabama 82-76 on Thursday. After the game, Pippen Jr. claimed that an Alabama assistant coach had words for him pregame about his assertion that they were beatable. “Before the game, one of the ‘Bama coaches said that you asked for it, so you’re going to get it or something like that,” Pippen Jr. said afterward, according to The Spun. “So it’s kind of good to get back at him and get the win.” Informed of these remarks, Alabama head coach Nate Oats did not sound happy with the unnamed assistant. “That’s probably not the smartest thing to be doing,” Oats said. “I’ll address that afterwards here. I didn’t know anything about that.” Vanderbilt is slated to play Kentucky in the SEC Tournament quarterfinals on Friday night.
