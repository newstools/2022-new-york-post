A thief in a bright orange wig was caught brazenly lobbing a cinder block through the window of a taxi parked in Manhattan to steal an iPhone and $40 cash, according to cops. The suspect, dressed all in black with an animal-pattern handbag, appeared to be fully aware they were being filmed as they strolled along West 37th Street near Hudson Yards last Thursday with the hefty block in hand. “What are you doing?” someone can be heard asking the thief, who repeatedly glanced toward the camera. The footage then shows the bold-haired bandit suddenly launch the cinder block through the driver-side window, clamber in and run away — discarding the orange wig on the way. “Holy …” a voice on the video said during the split-second raid. The cab was parked on West 37th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues while the 58-year-old driver took a quick bathroom break. Police confirmed the suspect, who they believe is female, took off with an iPhone 8 valued at $300 and $40 in cash.
