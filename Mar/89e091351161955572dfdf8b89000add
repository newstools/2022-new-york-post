A Ukrainian-born tequila mogul is putting his New York City beach manse on the auction block. Edward Geyman, founder of Laneta Tequila — and CEO of glass-making company Carvart — is putting his home up for auction on April 27 with Misha Haghani’s Paramount Realty in conjunction with listing brokers Victoria Shtainer of Compass, and Samuel Horowitz of Samuel Realty Group. He says that he is selling the home at auction to attract a “unique buyer” and that the sale has nothing to do with the ongoing war in Ukrainian. The home, at 151 Beach 146th St., is in Neponsit, a beachfront community in Queens, and the “suggested” opening bid is $4.5 million. It was originally asking $7 million. At 6,500 square feet, it features Atlantic Ocean views and outdoor space from all five bedrooms. The home was built in 2007, “just steps from the beach,” and could not be duplicated at a similar price point, the brokers note. The mansion boasts an indoor and outdoor pool, sauna rooms and a rooftop deck with ocean views. There’s also a formal living room and dining room, private elevator and white marble stairs with a handcrafted iron and walnut staircase. Design details include balconies, a porch, crown and decorative moldings, columns, hardwood floors, marble mosaics, high ceilings and oversize windows. Geyan’s father, a third-generation glass artisan, founded Carvart when he emigrated from Ukraine. The company now makes everything from pandemic-friendly partitions for restaurants like Electric Lemon to Hudson Yards glass for new luxury condos, with clients running the gamut from Christian Dior to an airport in Austin, Texas. Geyman founded Laneta Tequila during the pandemic and designed the glass bottle; the distillery is in Mexico.
