College basketball bettors have a number of games to choose from on Tuesday, but Anthony Dabbundo of The Action Network is focusing on the Big Ten. Dabbundo’s two best bets begin with an in-state matchup between Michigan and Michigan State, which comes in as a four-and-a-half point underdog. For Dabbundo, he sees this as a good opportunity to back the Wolverines on its home floor. “Michigan State made half of their threes in that first meeting [against Michigan],” Dabbundo says. In terms of shot quality, the first meeting was actually quite competitive despite the Spartans rolling by double digits in East Lansing. Given Michigan’s desperation at this juncture of the season, Dabbundo expects it will play much better and cover this number. The second matchup Dabbundo likes on tonight’s card: Purdue at Wisconsin, which isa two-and-a-half point home underdog. According to Dabbundo, he rates this a good bounce-back spot for the Boilermakers off a heartbreaking defeat to Michigan State. “I don’t think Wisconsin can shoot their way past the Boilermakers,” Dabbundo says.  Plus, seeing as Wisconsin has been riding unsustainable luck in close games, Dabbundo expects regression to come — and for Purdue to cover as a road favorite.
