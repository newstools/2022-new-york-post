They get an F in international politics. Two national teachers union honchos posted a photo of themselves accidentally holding an upside-down Ukrainian flag while rallying in support of the country — causing critics to flip, according to a report Wednesday. The American Federation of Teachers on Tuesday tweeted a photo of its president, Randi Weingarten, and vice president, Evelyn DeJesus, clutching a poster proclaiming “We stand with Ukraine” amid Russia’s invasion, according to FOX News, which captured a screengrab of the now-deleted image. But the sign featured a yellow strip above a blue one — the opposite of the Ukrainian flag, which symbolizes a sky over a bountiful field. Critics quickly pounced on the teachers and their union, which supported the closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, and fought against reopenings.

Others said the educators ought to take a class or two themselves. Corey DeAngelis, national director of research at School Choice Now, called the tweet “free advertising for school choice.” Weingarten later admitted her mistake and deleted the tweet. “The flag is upside down. My bad,” she tweeted Wednesday. A rep for AFT declined to comment Wednesday.
