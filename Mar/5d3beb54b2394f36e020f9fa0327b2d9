An Oregon woman gave birth on a sidewalk and abandoned the baby — walking away covered in blood and amniotic fluid during an apparent mental health crisis, according to a report. Portland police received word that the woman had given birth near Southwest 13th and Market streets about 11 a.m. Wednesday and then walked away, KOIN reported. Officer Kirby-Glatkowski and his partner were scouring the area in search of a serial burglar when they got the alarming call, according to the TV station. “It’s a cold day, it wasn’t raining at that moment, but it was raining earlier and the sidewalk at Southwest 13th and Market is no place to deliver a baby alone,” Kirby-Glatkowski told the outlet. Paramedics “said the mother, the woman, was stumbling away eastbound on Market with a lot of blood and amniotic fluid all over her,” he said. The Portland Police Bureau said the mother was found nearby, evaluated and held for a mental health evaluation. “She and her baby, a girl, were transported to the hospital by ambulance,” police said. Kirby-Glatkowski and his partner happen to be on the department’s Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team, which is trained to work with people in mental crisis. “My partner and I went to try and engage her, contact her, talk to her, see what was going on. We were able, with some additional resources on scene, [to] get her stopped at about 12th and Market and get her into an ambulance and into a hospital for physical assessment and also address other issues,” he told KOIN. In an Instagram post, a police bike squad thanked community members who immediately covered the baby and called 911. “I can’t believe, frankly, that that happened and I’m glad we have [as] safe of a resolution as possible today,” Kirby-Glatkowski said.
