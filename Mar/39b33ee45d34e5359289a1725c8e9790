Spring is in the air — but only for a day. Temperatures in the Big Apple are expected to jump from the low 40s on Saturday to a possible record high of nearly 70 degrees on Sunday before chilly weather returns,  forecasters said Friday. “It’s one of those things that’s like whiplash with warm weather that feels like spring, then cold again within a day or two,” Fox Weather meteorologist Greg Diamond told The Post. Saturday will be partly sunny with a low of 42 degrees before a strong southern wind causes temperatures to spike to a pleasantly balmy high of 69 degrees Sunday, Diamond said. “We’re going to have near-record high temperatures that day,” he said. The hottest temperature ever recorded in the city on the date was 68 degrees on March 6, 1935, and the average temperature is 47 degrees, Diamond said. Showers are expected to sprinkle the city Sunday morning before skies clear and temperatures drop to a rainy low of 43 degrees Monday, according to forecasters. “A high-pressure system is going to slide off the Atlantic Seaboard and winds will turn and come in from south,” Diamond said. “It will be warm, at least for a day.” After the dramatic warm-up, temps are expected to cool to a rainy low of 35 on Tuesday.
