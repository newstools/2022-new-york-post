Featuring the No. 2, 13, and 21 teams in the nation (Arizona, UCLA and USC, respectively), the Pac-12 is one of the most loaded conferences in all of college basketball. This week, they will all duke it out in the Pac-12 tournament – their last stop before March Madness 2022. According to FanDuel, Arizona is the clear -135 favorite to win the tournament. It is followed by the UCLA (+200) and USC (+1200). These odds are appropriate, as Arizona is overloaded with talent both offensively and defensively. The Wildcats rank number one in assists per game (20.1), second in rebounds per game (39.2), and have the second-best points per game differential (18.0), per FOX Sports. However, there is an intriguing team at long shot odds, and that is the Colorado Buffaloes – who are at a whopping +4000 to win the conference on FanDuel. Aside from being on of three to to have actually beaten Arizona, there are some things to like about Colorado. For starters, the Buffaloes play pretty tough defense, as showcased by their 97.9 defensive ratings (per FOX Sports). This is the fourth-best among the remaining teams in the conference. Furthermore, the Buffaloes shoot the most free throws per game, and hit them at an excellent 75.46% clip. Getting teams in foul trouble and making them pay at the line can lead to success in college basketball.  Having beaten Arizona as recently as Feb. 26, it is possible that Colorado has the blueprint laid out. Colorado rebounded very well in that game, somehow out-rebounding one of the best teams in the nation on the boards. As to be expected, the Pac-12 tournament goes through Arizona and its excellent roster. At 40:1 and a potential date scheduled for Friday, Colorado could be the longshot Pac-12 bet crazy enough to win.
