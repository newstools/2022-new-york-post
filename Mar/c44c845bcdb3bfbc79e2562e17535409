Ready to head into the spring season with fabulous hair? From outdoor shindigs in the warmer weather to bridal showers in preparation for the summer wedding season, there’s never been a better time to invest in high-quality hair tools. After two years of quarantining and laying low, our poor hair could use a break from the work-from-home messy buns and low-maintenance hairstyles. Give your locks the love they deserve and make sure you’re rocking fresh, spring ready tresses with help from the La Sirena Air Wave Hair Dryer with Blue Ionic Technology. This tech-heavy tool is currently on sale for a massive 68% off for a limited time, letting you take one home in either a pretty pink shade or a chic white for just $79.99. Any excellent hairstyle requires perfectly dried hair, but when was the last time you upgraded your hair dryer? This one gives you maximum drying power in the specific temperature needed for your particular hair type. Those with fine, thinner hair might require a lower temperature, and thicker, textured hair can benefit from the higher temperature options, all of which can be personalized with this dryer. Want to finish off your hair perfectly? There’s also a cool shot function for all hair styles to complete a perfect dry. The La Sirena is equipped with blue ionic technology that provides pro performance drying at home, giving you a salon-ready blowout from the comfort of your own bathroom. There are also plenty of attachments included, like a narrow set nozzle, wide set nozzle, and a diffuser to make sure you have the tools for your particular hair type and can leave the house with healthy, voluminous hair. Have good hair days with the La Sirena Air Wave Hair Dryer with Blue Ionic Technology, available in pink or a white for just $79.99 for a limited time. Prices subject to change.
