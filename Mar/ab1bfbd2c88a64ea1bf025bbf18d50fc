The team of Davids from tiny, unheralded Saint Peter’s College of Jersey City was preparing to do battle at Madison Square Garden against the bigger, badder Goliaths from nationally ranked Duke. Before the team charged onto the court and into the delirium of the National Invitational Tournament quarterfinals on the night of March 18, 1968, Peacocks reserve center Tom Schwester scrawled a message on the chalkboard in the locker room. “Run Baby Run.” And the unranked Peacocks ran baby ran all over Duke’s Blue Devils to a shocking 100-71 victory that until last week stood as the greatest athletic achievement in the school’s history.
