Bryson DeChambeau is making his first start in nearly two months this week at the WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas, after being sidelined with a fractured bone in his left hand and torn labrum in his left hip. His recovery, apparently, wasn’t helped either when he also suffered a more bizarre injury. The 28-year-old said he hurt his hand playing ping-pong at the Saudi International in early February, according to Golf Channel. “People are going to say it’s off of speed training and all that and, sure, some of the things have been a part of that, just abuse and working really, really hard,” DeChambeau told the network on Tuesday. “But at the same time, I wouldn’t have traded it for anything. I’ve learned so much about my body as time has gone on and learned how to manage things and how important rest is.” DeChambeau, who is teeing it up for the first time since withdrawing from the Saudi event, said he just started hitting shots with his irons last Tuesday. He added how he may eventually need to have surgery on the injured hand. “Am I going fully at it? No. Not even close,” he told Golf Channel. “I won’t be able to go at it until probably Augusta time.” The return got off to a rocky start on Wednesday, however, when DeChambeau’s opening tee shot at Austin Country Club landed in a tent. DeChambeau did bounce back in his match against 49-year-old Richard Bland, saving bogey after taking a free drop to halve the hole. DeChambeau is also scheduled to play in next week’s Valero Texas Open before heading to the Masters in two weeks.
