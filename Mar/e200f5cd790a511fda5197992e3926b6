The NBA has only six games on the schedule tonight, but Action Network NBA analyst Munaf Manji has two player props he’s targeting (video above). The first comes in the Brooklyn Nets’ visit to Charlotte to battle the Hornets. For that contest, Manji sees value in Kevin Durant’s points prop. Since Durant has returned from injury, he has scored at least 30 points in each of his two games. Plus, Manji explains that Durant has positive history against Hornets. “In a matchup earlier this season, Durant scored 38 points on 17 of 24 shooting against the Hornets,” Manji says. Even though the Hornets have a top-10 defense over the last five games, Manji believes Brooklyn is more desperate and Durant will lead the scoring charge. With that in mind, Manji is taking Kevin Durant over 29.5 points tonight. The second player prop Manji is focusing on is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander over 26.5 points vs. the Milwaukee Bucks. Manji explains the handicap is quite simple: with the Thunder’s backcourt decimated by injuries, Gilgeous-Alexander is their prime scoring option. “[Gilgeous-Alexander] is averaging 33.6 points/game over his last six games for the Thunder…and has cleared this point total in six straight games,” Manji says. With both Luguentz Dort and Josh Giddey out tonight against the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks, Manji expects another big performance from the University of Kentucky product.
