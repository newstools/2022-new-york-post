While AirPods are great for commuting, listening to your favorite audio books and zoom calls, if you want the best audio experience for listening to tunes, an over-the-ear option is your best bet. Normally, it will cost you a small fortune to buy a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones but luckily Amazon is discounting some of Sony’s top-rated pairs by up to 41 percent. Take advantage of the following deals while supplies last. The Sony Noise-Canceling headphones are an “Amazon’s Choice” product with almost 30,000 positive reviews. These Sony headphones offer up to 30 hours of battery life and have a touch sensor to control pausing, playing and skipping various tracks. In our own personal experience, we can vouch for the noise-cancelling feature as well — which comes in handy with plane turbulence or when there’s too many distractions while working from home. For an even better deal, go for the Sony WH-XB910N Extra Bass Noise Cancelling Headphones which are currently being discounted by 41% (more than $100 off the normal price)! These babies offer extra base for an impressively deep, punchy sound, up to 30 hours of sound and gives you 4.5 hours of juice after just 10 minutes of charging.
