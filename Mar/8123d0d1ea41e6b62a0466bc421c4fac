A real bat flew around inside a Texas movie theater during a showing of “The Batman” last week. Moviegoer Vincent Genovese said that, about halfway through the new caped crusader flick, he noticed a critter on screen — and realized it was real. “At one point on the screen, you kind of saw something flapping around. Within the context of the movie, it looked like a bat flying around on screen,” Genovese told The Post. “After a few minutes, one of the employees kind of yells, ‘Do you want me to stop the movie?'” Genovese recalled. The film at Cinepolis Moviehouse and Eatery in Austin on Friday was paused while animal control was called. Patrons were offered a refund if they didn’t feel safe being in the room with the bat, Genovese said. A handful of people left, but the majority stayed.  Eventually the movie resumed and Genovese said he thought the bat was gone. But when the film ended, theater employees were still trying to track the animal down. While moviegoers were not told how the bat got into the screening room, the theatre manager told KXAN a patron brought it in as a prank. “To ensure a prank like this does not again occur, we will be adding additional security and checking all bags upon guest entry,” the theatre told KXAN in a statement.
