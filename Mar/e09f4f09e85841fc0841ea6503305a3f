TAMPA — Yankees infielder/outfielder Miguel Andujar was assaulted and robbed Wednesday at his farm in the Dominican Republic, according to reports, but he is still on track to arrive at spring training this weekend. Andujar was “out of danger,” ESPN Deportes reported, but was beaten by two individuals who robbed him of a gold chain that was valued at around $7,000. The assailants also allegedly fired three bullets, according to the report, none of which hit Andujar. “We have been in contact with [Andujar] and are still in the process of gathering information regarding the incident,” a Yankees spokesman said Friday in a statement. “We do anticipate him to report to Tampa for spring training this weekend.” The 27-year-old Andujar will be trying to compete for a utility job off the bench this spring, coming off a disappointing last three seasons. Since finishing runner-up to Shohei Ohtani in the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year race, Andujar has played in just 78 games, batting .228 with a 60 OPS-plus while battling multiple injuries. The third baseman was limited to just 12 games in 2019 before undergoing shoulder surgery, then spent most of the COVID-shortened 2020 season at the Yankees’ alternate site. Last season, Andujar spent two months filling a void in left field — batting .253 with an 82 OPS-plus — before going on the injured list in July with a left wrist strain that he never returned from. Still, the Yankees this offseason tendered a contract to Andujar, who has one minor league option remaining.
