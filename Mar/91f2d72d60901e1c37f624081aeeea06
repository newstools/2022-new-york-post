Gisele Bündchen isn’t the only Buccaneers WAG excited about Tom Brady going back to Tampa Bay. Camille Kostek, the longtime girlfriend of tight end Rob Gronkowski, released a “PSA” on Sunday night in response to the quarterback’s decision to unretire after 40 days. “THIS IS A PSA,” Kostek exclaimed on her Instagram Story. “TOM BRADY IS BACK.” In a separate post, Kostek — who has been dating Gronkowski since 2015 — re-shared an ESPN clip that featured the 32-year-old tight end giggling alongside Brady, 44. Brady is the only quarterback Gronkowski has ever played for. The duo first teamed up in New England before Gronkowski retired in March 2019 after nine seasons. A year later, however, Gronkowski came out of retirement to join Brady and the Buccaneers. The duo went on to win a Super Bowl title in their first season in Tampa. The Buccaneers were bounced from the Divisional Round of the playoffs in January, with Brady announcing his retirement weeks later. Gronkowski, meanwhile, has not yet made a decision about his NFL future. Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said in February the team would welcome the five-time Pro Bowler back “with open arms.” NBC Sports’ Peter King expressed Monday in his “Football Morning in America” column that he believes Brady’s decision could influence Gronkowski, who is slated to become a free agent. “Regarding Brady’s other priorities: Gronkowski’s free, and his friends think he’ll return if Brady asks,” King wrote. Prior to Brady’s return, Gronkowski said he’d welcome the opportunity to play with Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Meanwhile, the Bills are said to have expressed interest in signing Gronkowski, per The Athletic.
