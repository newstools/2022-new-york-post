The woman wanted for shoving a beloved 87-year-old voice coach to her death in Manhattan nearly two weeks ago turned herself in to the NYPD Tuesday morning, police said. Lauren Pazienza, 26, was charged with manslaughter in the death of Barbara Maier Gustern after turning herself in at the NYPD’s 10th Precinct in Chelsea, cops said. Pazienza is from Port Jefferson. The NYPD released a clear picture Friday of the woman wanted in the horrific attack on Gustern, who struck her head after she was pushed from behind around 8:30 p.m. March 10 at West 28th Street and 8th Avenue. “She turned herself in with her attorney this morning,” a police official said. Gustern was in critical condition before she died March 14. Services will be held for Gustern on Saturday, March 26, according to her Facebook page.
