A 7-month-old baby girl has died after being mauled by a family dog in Georgia, authorities said. The baby, Serenity Garnett, was attacked by the American bulldog/Great Pyrenees mix on Tuesday at a home in suburban Augusta, WJBF-TV reported. Serenity was immediately rushed to the AU Medical Center, where she died of her injuries, the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office said. The infant’s great-grandmother, Migdelia Guadalupe, was babysitting her at the time of the attack. Guadalupe suffered non-life-threatening injuries trying to pull the dog away and had to be hospitalized. Authorities are still investigating what triggered the fatal dog attack. Neighbors told the television station that the animal, who belonged to the owners of the home where Guadalupe rented a room, appeared hard to control. “She didn’t have the strength to deal with that dog,” Stephen Fox said of the great-grandmother. “When he got out occasionally it was very hard to get back.” The dog is being quarantined for rabies testing pending the investigation.
