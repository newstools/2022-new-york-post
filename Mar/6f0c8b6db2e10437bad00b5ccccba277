Michelle Obama could put the Republicans into a “very difficult position” if she decided to run for president in 2024, a former Trump official said. The former first lady is a “completely plausible” candidate for the Democratic nomination, Monica Crowley said during a panel discussion last week, despite the fact that President Biden has vowed to run for reelection. “If they were to run Michelle Obama, that would put us in a very difficult position because they’d reach for a candidate who is completely plausible, very popular, and immune to criticism,” Crowley said at the Conservative Political Action Committee. “Also, when you think about her positioning, she spoke as a DNC keynote speaker in 2020, she wrote her autobiography and did a 50-city tour, she has massive Netflix and Spotify deals, and she’s got a voting-rights group alongside Stacey Abrams.” Crowley, a political commentator and former Fox News contributor, was speaking on a panel with GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, right-wing activist Jack Posobiec, and author Kurt Schlichter. Obama has repeatedly expressed her desire to remain away from politics — even though she gets asked “all the time.” “It’s not something that I’m interested in, or would ever do — ever,” she told Jimmy Kimmel in 2018.
