A fender bender quickly escalated into deadly road rage when a man was fatally stabbed in The Bronx Saturday night. The 42-year-old man was a passenger in a car driven by his girlfriend when the vehicle was involved in a minor collision on Bruckner Boulevard near Castle Hill Avenue in Castle Hill moments before midnight, police said. All of the involved parties got out of their cars and the victim was stabbed in the right leg during the confrontation, according to the NYPD. He later died at Jacobi Medical Center, police said. The killer drove off in his unspecified vehicle and remained in the wind Sunday morning.
