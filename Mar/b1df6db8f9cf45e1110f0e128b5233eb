Olympic pole vaulter Alysha Newman nearly melted the snow with her latest Instagram snap. On Monday, the Canadian track and field star – who is also a model – shared a bikini photo of herself before she entered an outdoor jacuzzi. “Caught between seasons,” Newman captioned her post, adding a slew of hashtags, including, “Recovery” and “Love on my mind.” The two-time Olympic pole vaulter showed off her six-pack in a dark-colored bikini and wore white gloves and a fur hat. She stepped out in a pair of Pajar Canada boots. Newman has become a popular fixture on social media and has over half a million Instagram followers. Fans have become enamored over her busy modeling and pole vaulting careers, which she documents on social media — from her workouts, to her red carpet snaps. The 27-year-old was named one of Maxim’s Hot 100 women in 2021, and works with a number of fashion, beauty and health/wellness lifestyle brands, including Bio True and Emergen-C. Newman shared a positive message with fans last month, and said she’s “fighting the hardest fight” to return to the sport. “I promised myself that I wouldn’t rush back into competing. One day at a time to build that confidence back!” she wrote on Instagram, showing a photo of herself pole-vaulting. Last June, Newman opened up about her recovery from a concussion that she described as an “eye-opening” experience — telling fans that she had never felt in better shape from the neck down at the time. Newman was in Tokyo for last summer’s COVID-19 postponed Olympic Games, but failed to take off on all three of her attempts in the qualification round of the pole vault event.
