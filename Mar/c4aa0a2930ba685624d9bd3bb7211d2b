Dramatic video caught the moment Walmart shoppers in Miami rushed in to grab a man who allegedly tried to rape a woman after he lifted her dress and tore off her underwear. The frightening incident took place about 9:30 p.m. Sunday inside the Miami-Dade store on Northwest 79th Street, where the man approached the victim from behind, NBC Miami reported. The suspect, identified as Bredan Harvey, 28, of Miami Gardens, pulled up the woman’s dress, grabbed her private parts and ripped off her underwear after he shoved her to the floor, police said. But other shoppers rushed to the woman’s aid after she began screaming. Cellphone video posted on Only in Dade show the good Samaritans pulling the alleged would-be rapist off the woman and holding him down until cops arrived. Harvey was charged with sexual battery and taken to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, CBS 4 reported. “It wasn’t somewhere isolated. He didn’t care it was in the wide open,” Detective Alvaro Zabaleta said, NBC Miami reported. “Because he was so brazen, investigators feel perhaps he may have done this before, and there may be more victims,” he added. Police are asking anyone with information to call the Sex Crimes Investigation Unit at 305-715-3300. “The safety of our associates and customers is among our top priorities. We’re very disturbed to see something like this happening to a customer in our store and are grateful that the assailant was captured and detained until police arrived,” Walmart rep Robert Arrieta told The Post in an email.
