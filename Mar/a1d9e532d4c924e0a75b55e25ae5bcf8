A 14-year-old Florida student was arrested last week after school employees found a “kill list” on the teen’s phone, authorities said. Faculty members at West Gate K-8 School in Port St. Lucie notified deputies of the chilling list last Tuesday. The student was charged with eight felony counts of written threats to kill, according to St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office. As deputies searched the student’s home for weapons, they discovered cocaine and drug paraphernalia allegedly belonging to the teen’s mother, 40-year-old Brooke Lynne Hinkle. Hinkle was charged with drug possession and child neglect. The teen was taken to the Department of Juvenile Justice. The mother was booked into the St. Lucie County Jail and held on a $6,250 bond.
