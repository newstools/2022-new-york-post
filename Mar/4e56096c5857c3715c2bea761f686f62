Julianne Hough has found her new New York home as she finalizes her divorce and makes her way to the Great White Way. Sources told Page Six the “Dancing With the Stars” alum has signed a lease on an $18,000-a-month triplex townhouse. Features include “beautifully preserved and restored turn-of-the-century craftsmanship, original detailed wood floors, living room fireplace, 12-foot ceilings, central air, washer/dryer, massive… living room and bedrooms, a family room, and a home office,” according to the listing. “This home is a… masterpiece. The gourmet open kitchen is equipped with stunning quality finishes. Contact me today to grasp the opportunity to reside in this magnificent New York City home,” the listing notes. The townhouse is steps away from Washington Square Park and was on the market for only 21 days. Hough scooped it up from luxury Compass real estate broker Terrence Harding, AKA MC Klepto from Junior M.A.F.I.A, the 90s hip hop group founded by the late Notorious B.I.G., featuring Lil Kim. Harding is also pals with Mayor Eric Adams, so perhaps Hough will be rubbing elbows with hizzoner. Hough is moving to the Big Apple to star in “POTUS,” opening this spring. She’s appearing along with Vanessa Williams, Lea DeLaria, Suzy Nakamura, Rachel Dratch, Lilli Cooper and Julie White. “My entire life, I have always been inspired by the umatched talent that graces the Broadway stage. Being part of a production like this speaks to the artistry, dedication, and grit that it takes to become that level of entertainer,” she wrote on Instagram earlier this month. “I am incredibly humbled and honored to be joining Susan, Selina and this extraordinary talented cast and crew for my Broadway debut,” she said. Hough’s big move also comes on the heel of her finalizing her divorce from Brooks Laich last month. Reps for Compass and Hough did not comment.
