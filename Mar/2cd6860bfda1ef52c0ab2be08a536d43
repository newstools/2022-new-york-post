Juju Smith-Schuster will soon be catching passes from another Super Bowl-winning quarterback. The former Steelers receiver, 25, announced Friday that he’s joining Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, signing a one-year, $10.75 million deal, per NFL Network. “#ChiefsKingdom Let’s Go!” Smith-Schuster wrote, to which the Chiefs quarterback replied, “Turn me up brotha!!!” A second-round draft pick out of USC in 2017, Smith-Schuster spent the past five seasons with Steelers and the now-retired Ben Roethlisberger. During his career in Pittsburgh, he played in 63 games, recording 323 receptions for 3,855 yards and 26 touchdowns. Prior to the start of the 2021 season, Smith-Schuster resigned with the Steelers on a one-year, $8 million deal. Moments before he announced his new home Friday, Smith-Schuster penned a heartfelt note to Steelers nation. “Thank you for taking me in and making me a part of the family from the moment I was drafted. You all took me in so quickly, and I really needed it,” he began. “I was a wide-eyed 20-year old who was sent to the east coast away from my family for the first time in my life, and you made me feel right at home, despite all the loneliness I should have felt. These have been the best five years in my life. I owe so much to the fans who embraced me and who made playing on Sunday’s in Pittsburgh so special. It was an honor to wear the black and gold for you all! I love you!” Smith-Schuster joins the AFC powerhouse Chiefs, who fell short of a third-straight Super Bowl appearance in January. Mahomes will have quite the arsenal for 2022, which is already loaded with receivers Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman, running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and tight end Travis Kelce.
