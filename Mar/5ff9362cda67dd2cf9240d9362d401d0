The Edmonton Oilers are a talented, but flawed hockey team. Edmonton has tremendous upside thanks to a prolific offense headlined by Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, but the Oilers also can lose on any given night thanks to an inconsistent defense and below-average goaltending. The Oilers enter play on Monday ranked ninth in the NHL in goals per game, third in power-play percentage, eighth in expected goals per 60 minutes, and 12th in high-danger chances created at 5-on-5. That kind of offensive production should make the Oilers a legitimate contender, but very few teams will be able to contend when things are so desperate in their own zone. Of the 16 teams currently in a playoff spot, Edmonton ranks 16th in goals allowed per game and 16th in save percentage. Monday night’s contest with the Coyotes should be just what the doctor ordered for an Oilers team that has allowed 19 goals in its four games and just shipped nine to their biggest rival on Hockey Night in Canada. Not only is Arizona in last place in the entire NHL, but the Coyotes have dropped five in a row and are traveling to Edmonton after playing in Winnipeg on Sunday night. Oddsmakers certainly think that this should be a straightforward win for the Oilers, who are -400 favorites at the time of writing. However, nothing is ever black-and-white with the Oilers. Arizona is terrible, but no team is unbeatable against Edmonton’s goaltending. Putting your hard-earned money on the worst team in the NHL is nobody’s idea of a fun time, but the cold reality of betting is that some nights you’re just going to need to plug your nose and play the numbers. At +300 and rising, the Coyotes are worth a shot against the helter-skelter Oilers. Oilers vs. Coyotes pick: Coyotes ML +310
