Heading into Wednesday’s game, the Blues and the Rangers sit one point apart in the NHL standings, and both have playoff aspirations. The Blues are on a seven-game point streak, where they’ve gone 6-0-1. But it should be noted that, other than a 6-3 win over Toronto, the other six games in that streak were against non-playoff teams. However, the streak has helped top goaltender Jordan Binnington regain his top form. The Rangers have also gotten excellent play from Igor Shesterkin, who has been the foundation for their success this season with his league-leading 31.1 goals saved above expected and .941 save percentage. There isn’t much to differentiate these two teams, which follow similar blueprints. Both are successful despite less-than-dazzling five-on-five possession numbers and rely on superb goaltending. When they’re on their game, the Blues are more explosive offensively — and lately, they have been on their game. As of Tuesday afternoon, both sides hold even odds for a win. The Blues are on more of a hot streak, but the Shesterkin factor is real. With Binnington also looking sharp, expect a goaltender’s duel at MSG. It’s not easy to feel comfortable recommending an under of 5.5, but that looks like a plausible outcome. The play: Under 5.5 (-105); play down to -115.
