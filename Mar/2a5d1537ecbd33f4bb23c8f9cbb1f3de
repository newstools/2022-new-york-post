At least one team wants to keep Rob Gronkowski from following Tom Brady into retirement. The Buffalo Bills are interested in signing the former Patriots and Buccaneers tight end, according to The Athletic. The Bills spoke with the tight end last offseason before he resigned with the Bucs on a one-year deal, per the report. The article stated how “there is hope at One Bills Drive that Gronkowski would be willing to finish his career in Western New York.” Gronkowski, 32, is among the Bucs’ large list of free agents that the team will have to make a decision on after Brady’s retirement. The future Hall of Famer may be less inclined to remain in Tampa without Brady’s presence – especially if they turn to an unproven option at quarterback. The Bills, meanwhile, are a bona fide Super Bowl contender with a star quarterback in Josh Allen under center. Despite getting good play out of Dawson Knox in 2021, the team’s roster is still thin at tight end. Gronkowski was born in Western New York and was a Bills fan growing up. In February, he mentioned Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow as a quarterback he would like to play with – but one would imagine Allen would be a decent consolation prize.
