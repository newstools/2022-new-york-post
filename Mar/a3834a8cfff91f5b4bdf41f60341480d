The NYPD discriminates against black and Latino job candidates, a high-ranking civilian employee claims in a new lawsuit. The NYPD uses a “biased investigation process” to boot civil service candidates from working with the department, and doesn’t give those workers enough time to challenge the decisions made against them, according to court papers. The legal claim from Arabia Jennings says she was sidelined and sent to work in a rodent-infested storage closet after she raised alarms about the department’s hiring practices. Jennings rose through the ranks to eventually supervise the NYPD’s Civil Litigation Unit, where staffers review recommendations to disqualify civil service candidates from working with the department. Jennings, who is black, voiced concern about “a disproportionate number of African-American and Latino candidates [that] were being disqualified from employment with the NYPD,” she said in the Manhattan Federal Court lawsuit. When she told superiors of her concerns, Jennings claims she was stripped of her responsibilities, forced to train a white man as her replacement and then bounced from unit to unit. Eventually she was assigned “to work in an office that was being used as storage closet, was infested with mold, rodents and rodent droppings,” she alleges in legal papers. Jennings, who first joined the department in 2003 before a short stint with the city Department of Correction, wants a court to bar the NYPD “from denying job benefits and opportunities to employees on the basis of race and gender,” according to the lawsuit. “The NYPD has strong anti-discrimination policies in place and is committed to diversity.  We’ll review the case,” a city Law Department spokesman said.
