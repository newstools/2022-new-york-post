Here’s a place to hang your coat. Burlington CEO Michael Sullivan is listing his opulent Northern California estate for $12.75 million. Made up of five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, the main residence was initially designed in the early 1900s by renowned architect Charles Peter Weeks. At the time, Weeks was commissioned to create the glorious Beaux Arts-style mansion for prominent East Bay banker Edson Adams for around $100,000 In the 1970s, following Adams death, Joseph Russell Knowland Sr., a congressman and publisher of the Oakland Tribune newspaper, purchased the home. It remained in the family until 2004 when it sold. Four years later, in 2008, Sullivan, 56, purchased the property for $5.95 million. If he is able to score anywhere near the asking price, he will be walking away with a hefty profit. Pegged as an “architectural masterpiece,” the Piedmont residence features “grand scale dimensions, rich architectural detail, and exquisite artisan craftsmanship,” the listing states. In addition to the main residence, which spans over 10,200 square feet, the home boasts a separate one-bedroom, one-bathroom studio apartment. Meanwhile, the main property features a gourmet kitchen with a central Carrera marble island, two Sub Zero refrigerators and a La Cornue stove. Amenities include a recently renovated lower level that features a custom wine cellar, game rooms, and an exercise room. There is also an expansive terrace that spans the back of the home. Dan Walner with Compass holds the listing. Sullivan has been the CEO and Director of the Burlington retail stores (formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory) since 2019.
