A 23-year-old woman was sexually assaulted at a Brooklyn subway station during the morning commute by a brute who threw her into a barrier and tore at her clothes, police said. The suspect grabbed the young woman as she walked down the stairs at the Prospect Park station towards the Q train southbound platform just after 7 a.m. last Thursday. He then pushed the victim against the bars that separate the steps from the platform, cops said. The perp covered the woman’s mouth with his hand as he ripped at her clothing and touched her breasts. The terrifying attack only stopped when another person happened to walk by — causing the suspect to flee the station, police said. Despite the ordeal, cops said the victim wasn’t physically hurt. The NYPD on Tuesday released a surveillance image of the suspect inside the station in a bid to track him down. He was last seen wearing a dark-colored jacket, a yellow hooded sweatshirt and dark-colored pants. Cops described him as approximately 6’0″ tall, 155 pounds, with a dark complexion and a slim build.
