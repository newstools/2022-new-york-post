The 8-9 matchup in the West Region of  the NCAA Tournament features a pair of of opposites in Boise State and Memphis. The experienced Broncos will slow the tempo down, while the young Tigers will try and run at every opportunity. Spread: Memphis (-3) vs. Boise State (+3) Moneyline: Memphis (-155) vs. Boise State (+135) Total: Over/Under: 133.5 Gametime: 1:45 PM ET TV Channel: TNT Live Stream: March Madness Live App, Sling TV, FuBo TV  Penny Hardaway’s Tigers can’t run against a team that crawls. Though Memphis has momentum entering the tournament, Boise State’s physical and experienced defense is built to prevent teams from stringing successful possessions together. A talented, but undisciplined group like Memphis — which commits more turnovers than all but three teams in the nation — is even more likely to experience frustration. The Broncos have covered seven of their past eight games against the spread as an underdog.
