Doug Edert could feel the burn of St. Peter’s basketball coach Shaheen Holloway’s glare on him, but he still couldn’t escape the moment fast enough. This happened long after the Cinderella of March Madness upset No. 3 seed Purdue on Friday night to become the first-ever No. 15 seed to reach the Elite Eight. And long after the raucous celebration that included Edert climbing onto the scorer’s table to soak in the crowd. And long after the St. Peter’s players crashed Holloway’s immediate postgame on-court interview with CBS to show love for their coach. In the quieter press conference, a reporter asked Edert about his “Kobe-esque” moment of hopping on the table. One of the most iconic photos of the late Kobe Bryant’s Hall of Fame career shows him standing on the scorer’s table, holding a basketball in one outstretched arm as confetti rained down to celebrate a championship. Before Edert could answer, Holloway – unaware of what happened – shot his guard a disapproving look and asked, “You hopped on the table?” A room of media burst into laughter sensing that, despite his heroics at the free-throw line late in the game, Edert might soon face a scolding from Holloway when the excitement died down. “Wait, wait, wait,” Edert said, trying to quiet the crowd and control the moment as he laughed himself. “I found a little opening and people started moving stuff, so I don’t know. I was so excited.” The laughter started up again. Edert clearly could feel himself digging a deeper hole with Holloway, who was sitting two seats away on the dais shaking his head. “I don’t know. Next question, please,” Edert said, gesturing with his hands for the moderator to speed things up. “Next question. Next question.” It’s safe to assume the mustachioed Edert was easily forgiven. He’ll resume his starring role when St. Peters faces North Carolina on Sunday with a berth in the Final Four on the line.
