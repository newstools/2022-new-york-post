As the days go on, it’s looking more and more like Tiger Woods could play the 2022 Masters. The 15-time major champion hasn’t played competitively since the 2020 Masters, which took place in November, and it looks like he is hoping to make a return at the 2022 edition. Woods was spotted playing at his home course in Florida over the weekend, and reports indicate he was at Augusta National on Tuesday. The last time we saw Woods on the golf course was December, when he played with his son, Charlie, at the PNC Championship. Woods mostly used a golf cart to get around the course that week. Woods suffered serious injuries during a car accident in February 2021, the week after he hosted the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in Southern California. Obviously, the golf world is unsure what to expect from Tiger if he does play. But he’s got quite the history at Augusta National. Since the start of the 1997 Masters, his first appearance at this tournament as a professional, Woods has made 21 starts at Augusta National. His lowest finish during that time is a tie for 40th and he won the 2019 Masters as one of the favorites at 14-1. Tiger finished in a tie for 38th during the November 2020 Masters, and that includes a score of 10 on a par 3 in the final round. If Tiger hypothetically pars that hole, he would have finished T-13. With news that Woods was at Augusta National on Tuesday, Action Network’s Darren Rovell noted that Tiger’s Masters odds at BetMGM went from 66-1 to 50-1.  DraftKings has taken a different approach. Woods was 40-1 to win the Masters in the buildup to the WGC-Dell Match Play, but he was listed at 70-1 on Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. A couple hours later, he was back down to 55-1. At Caesars, Woods was 60-1 on Sunday night but down to 50-1 on Tuesday. Woods remained steady at 50-1 on FanDuel as of Tuesday at noon, as well as at PointsBet, which already had him at 70-1. At PointsBet, Woods is sixth in the field with 3.7 percent of the bets and seventh with 4.1 percent of the handle, according to Rovell. At DraftKings, Woods makes up 3.5 percent of the betting handle and 2.8 percent of the bets. Bookmakers called BetMGM’s moving Woods from 66-1 to 50-1 “a market move.” There, he has 3.3 percent of the money, which is 13th most. At the SuperBook, they’re not budging yet. There, Woods is listed at 100-1, and that number hasn’t changed. “We’re not moving until we see more support,” SuperBook’s Jeff Sherman told Rovell. “We took a $1,046 wager on him at 100-1 in January, but he’s not in the top five of tickets or money for us.”
