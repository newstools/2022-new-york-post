After a narrow victory over Cornell, the top-seeded Princeton Tigers will take on the second-seed Yale Bulldogs for the Ivy League championship. Princeton boasts a lethal offense  but struggles on the defensive end, and their poor free throw shooting could be the Achilles heel that does them in. Gametime: 12:00 pm EST TV: ESPN2 Live Stream: ESPN App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV Yale won the first meeting by six. Princeton took the second matchup by six. I’ll take the points in a coin-flip game. I’ll also take the Ivy League’s top defense and the team that can be trusted at the line in a close game. Despite being one of the best offenses in the country, the Tigers are one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the nation, hitting under 65 percent. That Achilles’ heel won’t improve in the most pressure-filled game of their lives.
