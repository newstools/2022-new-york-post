A serial Manhattan burglar was back in custody Tuesday, just three days after being released without bail for a rash of smash-and-grab Midtown heists, The Post has learned. Morris Gilmore, 50, is awaiting arraignment on a pair of new robberies after being cut loose Saturday after allegedly burglarizing four city businesses, according to court records and law enforcement sources. Gilmore, who sources said has 29 prior arrests for burglary, assault, and drug possession, was picked up Tuesday on new charges that he allegedly struck again on Sunday — the day after his release — and on Monday. “This guy is a prolific criminal and this is his job,” one Manhattan cop griped. “Meanwhile he is destroying small businesses and hurting people who are trying to make an honest living. “He went right back to committing crimes because he knows he won’t go to jail.” Gilmore’s most recent busts came last week, when Manhattan prosecutors charged him with four burglaries in Midtown dating to Feb. 24,  according to a criminal complaint filed by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. According to the complaint, Gilmore burglarized a store at 750 Eighth Ave. at around 3:45 a.m. on the 24th, smashing the front window with a hammer and grabbing merchandise. On Feb. 28, he allegedly smashed the window at a store at 790 8th Ave. at 3 a.m. On Friday, he is accused of pulling off heists at 1550 Broadway around 1:35 a.m. and at 694 8th Ave. about two hours later. He was charged with third-degree burglary in all the incidents but released Saturday on supervised release — because the charge is not eligible for bail under the state’s controversial justice reform statute. According to sources, Gilmore was arrested again on Tuesday and charged with the new two new burglaries. The details are pending his arraignment. His public defender lawyer could not be reached for comment.
