The deranged homeless man accused of stabbing two workers at the Museum of Modern Art has been ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation as part of an unrelated arson case in Philadelphia. Gary Cabana, 60, was collared in the City of Brotherly Love on March 15 after allegedly torching a local Best Western hotel room — while on the run from the NYPD for the caught-on-video MoMA attack. On Tuesday, court records show that Cabana went before Philadelphia Judge Sharon Williams-Losier and was ordered to undergo the psych exam — as authorities in the Big Apple seek to extradite him to New York. Cabana is accused of flying into a violent rage at MoMA on March 12 after being told his membership to the museum had been revoked due to a couple of past outbursts. He is seen on surveillance footage jumping over the counter and repeatedly stabbing two 24-year-old workers before fleeing. While on the lam, the homeless culture nut posted bizarre rants on social media — and even exchanged messages on Instagram with The Post. Early on March 15, Philadelphia police arrested Cabana while he was sleeping on a bench outside a Greyhound bus station, with cops saying he was bound for Florida. He is being held without bail in Philly on charges of arson, criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and causing catastrophe for the hotel fire.
