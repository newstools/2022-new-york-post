A TikTok user has gone viral over her eye-popping childbirth experience. Bethany Collins, 23, told her followers that she pushed so hard during labor that one of her eyes actually “popped out” – but said it went back to normal six weeks later. In a photograph she shared of herself at the hospital, her left eye is seen bulging out of her head. “My doctor said, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen this happen before’, but now I have Miss Phoebe,” the new mom captioned her post. During the strain of childbirth, women may experience bloodshot eyes, according to the website BabyCenter. “Pushing and straining raise your blood pressure, which can cause broken capillaries and red eyes. But don’t worry – bloodshot eyes are generally harmless and resolve within two weeks,” according to the outlet. But despite her more extreme eye episode, Collins suffered no long-term effects. Meanwhile, fellow mothers shared their own experiences.“Omg! My eyes bleed because I pushed so hard. I looked so scary,” one wrote. “This is why I closed my eyes,” another said. A third added: “Reasons not to get pregnant.”
