Two American tourists were killed after being chopped up by a boat propeller while snorkeling in Mexico. The unidentified 65-year-old man and 60-year-old woman were in the water near Isla Mujeres, an island off the coast of Cancun, according to the Mexican outlet Noticaribe. They had taken a Squalo Adventures tourism boat to an area known for its artificial reefs and sunken ships where the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea meet, the article said. It was unclear how the accident happened or if the boat operator was arrested, according to the report.
