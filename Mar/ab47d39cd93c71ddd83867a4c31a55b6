Rents continue to rage across the nation — especially in the white-hot Sunshine State. Florida had three of the top 10 metro areas with the steepest rent hikes in February, more than any other state. A Redfin study found that rents in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach each popped by 30 percent in February compared to the same month last year. Austin topped the list with a staggering 40 percent rise in rental costs in February, followed by Portland at 39 percent. New York City continued to see rebounding rents last month and placed third with a spike of 36 percent compared to last year. Newark and New Brunswick in New Jersey, along with Nassau County on Long Island also saw 36 percent jumps in rents, according to the Redfin study. West Coast hotspots like San Francisco and San Jose saw far less marked rental increases than their East Coast counterparts. San Francisco was up 16 percent and San Jose 14 percent, according to the study. Los Angeles was one of few major metro areas with a rental prices increase of less than 10 percent in February with a 9.8 percent rise. Denver rounded out the top 10 list with a 29 percent surge. Nationally, rents popped by 15 percent, Redfin found. Of the 50 most populous metro areas surveyed by the firm’s analysts, only two — Milwaukee and Kansas City — saw rental prices decline last month. Median mortgage payments also continued to skyrocket in February, climbing by a staggering 31 percent nationally compared to the same month last year. “The cost of housing is going up for homebuyers and renters, but it’s going up more quickly for homebuyers,” said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather. “That’s because mortgage rates have increased sharply, and will likely continue to do so. When the cost of homeownership increases, many potential homebuyers opt to rent instead, which drives up rental prices.”
