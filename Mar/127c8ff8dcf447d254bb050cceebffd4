SARASOTA  – The Yankees’ already thin catching situation has taken another hit this spring, as newly acquired Ben Rortvedt has been sidelined with an oblique injury, according to Aaron Boone. The 24-year-old is still doing catching drills, but isn’t hitting, which figures to put his readiness for Opening Day in question. Rortvedt was acquired from Minnesota in the deal that also brought Josh Donaldson and Isiah Kiner-Falefa to The Bronx in exchange for Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela. The lefty-swinging Rortvedt is expected to split time behind the plate with Kyle Higashioka.
