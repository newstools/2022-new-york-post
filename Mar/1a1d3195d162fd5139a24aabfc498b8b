Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso is letting his privilege show: Last Friday, Twitter sleuth @placardabuse caught the pol driving with an expired registration and parking with an expired city-issued parking permit. “Hi @BKBPReynoso. Is this your car, with the expired @nysdmv registration, using an expired @NYCCouncil placard?” ran the tweet, with photos of Reynoso’s dark grey Nissan Rogue parked in front of a sidewalk ramp outside Borough Hall with its City Council-issued placard and plates. “Yes, that’s my bad, genuinely,” the staunchly anti-car Reynoso tweeted back the next morning. Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah! “Seldom used, I brought it out to handle all these issues,” he tweeted. “Removed Gov’t plates and returning placard. Dealing with DMV on registration. Will no longer have plates or placard moving forward. No excuses.” It’s not the first time the Brooklyn beep’s chutzpah has been on display: Public records show his vehicle has 12 violations, including seven for illegal parking and four for expired registration or inspection stickers, per the “How’s My Driving NY” database. This is the same man who in January dismissed constituent parking concerns as “not my responsibility.” That’s probably because he’s too busy shirking his own responsibility in favor of his privilege; another Twitter photo shows his car parked in a no-standing zone with his city placard in the dash. Making the chutzpah more profound, Reynoso made fighting parking-placard abuse, particularly around Borough Hall, one of his chief issues in running for office last year. Then again, logic is hardly Reynoso’s strong suit: He once proposed a bill to let bicyclists charge on through stop signs and red lights after merely slowing down. Even our bike-furious colleague Steve Cuozzo has more regard for cyclists’ safety.
