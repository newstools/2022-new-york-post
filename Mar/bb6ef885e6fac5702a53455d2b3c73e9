A hangry puppy took “looking good enough to eat” literally after desperately trying to consume ravishing photos of food in a magazine. Clip of the pooch’s Sisyphean bid for sustenance currently boasts 2.7 million views on TikTok. The eight-second clip, which is hashtagged #puppiesoftiktok, shows the peckish pooch, though to be a chihuahua mix, frantically pawing and lapping at mag photos of pasta, meatballs and other treats after apparently mistaking them for the real deal. In particular, the pup hones in on a spoon filled with a delicious sauce and scratches trying to get a taste. Needless to say, the internet was in stitches over the gastronomic gaffe with one commenter writing:  “She’s not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she’s cute!” “Maybe it’s a scratch and sniff,” quipped one jokester, while another wrote, “Yeah, sometimes I want the food pictured in magazines too.” Even the iconic canine-repping account WeRateDogs chimed in, writing: “Food looks so good you can almost taste it.” The dog’s inability to distinguish real and fake food is perhaps particularly baffling given canine’s incredible sense of smell: Dog noses contain an estimated 125 million sensory glands in the noses, depending on their breed, compared to a human’s 5-to-10 million, per the American Kennel Club. In a more salacious case of mistaken identity in 2019, a randy male deer confused a decoy for a doe and ended up humping it so vigorously its head came off.
