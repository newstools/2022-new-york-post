Two excellent teams faceoff on Thursday night when the Vermont Catamounts take on the Arkansas Razorbacks. Odds according to BetMGM Sportsbook have the Arkansas Razorbacks as four-and-a-half point favorites. Arkansas has had some issues in big games in the past, getting blown out by an inferior Texas A&M team in the SEC Tournament. Still, their roster is loaded with talent and is a favorite against a trendy sleeper team like Vermont. Predictions for this round one March Madness game will be interesting to look at ahead of the big games. There could be many upsets this weekend.  Provided by BetMGM Spread: Vermont +4.5 vs. Arkansas -4.5 Moneyline: Vermont +175 | Arkansas -225 Total: Over/Under 139.5 Gametime: 9:20 p.m. EST TV Channel: TNT Live Stream: March Madness Live App I hate how popular the Catamounts have become as an upset pick, but it’s with good reason. The America East champs have lost once since Dec. 7. The senior-heavy team is led by stars with high ceilings (Ryan Davis, Ben Shungu), but also features the balance to allow any player to shine on any night. Vermont is the nation’s third-best shooting team, the best defensive rebounding team in the country, the 10th-best at protecting the ball, and the 17th-best at defending without fouling,  negating much of Arkansas’ strengths. The half-court game doesn’t suit the Hogs and it is the game that Vermont’s slow pace and high-level shot-making will force them to play.
