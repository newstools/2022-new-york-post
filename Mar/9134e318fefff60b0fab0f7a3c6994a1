The body of a missing Florida woman was found in a septic tank behind her home after she was allegedly killed and dumped there by her handyman, according to police. Keoki Hilo Demich, 34, was charged with murdering Cynthia Cole, 57, who went missing shortly after attending an art festival in Jensen Beach over a week ago, Martin County Sheriff said on Facebook Saturday. Cops allegedly found doorbell camera footage of Demich leaving Cole’s Jeep near her home the night she was last seen and arrested him on Friday, according to WPBF News. Deputies searched her property and noticed the top of a septic tank in her backyard was ajar — then looked inside and found Cole’s body emerged in the cesspool, police said. “I’ve been doing this 40 plus years. I’ve never seen anything like it,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told the outlet. Police say Demich, who had reportedly worked for Cole for several years, likely murdered her in her home before dropping her into the septic tank. “He made several statements that we know are false so he was charged with second-degree murder,” said Snyder. The body has not been positively identified by the medical examiner’s office but police said they “have every reason to believe” it’s Cole. Cole, who went by Cyndi, was last seen with friends at the Jammin Jensen festival on Feb. 24.
