A St. Bonaventure University cheerleader and a member of the Saint Louis men’s basketball team reportedly got into an on-court spat during the Atlantic 10 men’s basketball tournament last Friday. Viral footage of the incident shows the cheerleader and a woman, who is believed to be her coach, angrily storming off the court. It’s unclear what was said due to the screaming fans at the game. The St. Bonaventure University cheerleader responded to the footage on Twitter and claimed a Billikens player yelled obscenities at her, according to multiple reports. “This was after he looked me dead in the eyes, an innocent cheerleader, and told me to ‘shut the f–k up, b–ch’ embarrassing,” a tweet by Hannah Koning read. Koning’s Twitter bio reads “Bonas” with a heart while an Instagram account, which is also believed to belong to the cheerleader, states “Bonas Cheer” in the bio. On Friday, Mid-Major Madness reported that Jordan Nesbitt, a freshman guard for Saint Louis, “had been chirping the Bonaventure cheerleaders all game, calling them disgusting names.” The outlet added how “he came up at the end of the game and said some more.” Koning also re-posted a tweet that claimed Nesbitt had been calling the cheerleaders “disgusting names” throughout the game. Nesbitt recorded zero points and just five rebounds in 34 minutes in his team’s win. Saint Louis ultimately topped St. Bonaventure 57-56 in the game before losing to Davidson in the semifinals. Saint Louis University’s athletic department did not immediately reply to The Post’s request for comment.
