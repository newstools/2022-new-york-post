New York City has come back from the pandemic by one metric, but it’s not a good one: crime. Major crimes are up 20% over February 2020, per the newest NYPD data. Murders have surged 45% in that month-to-month comparison. Felony assaults are up almost 13%; burglaries, about 23%. Car thefts are up a hideous 130%. Even the number of drivers running red lights has spiked, with traffic deaths hitting a 14-year high. We doubt this is what Mayor Eric Adams meant about giving New York its swagger back. Just this week a man slashed a 68-year-old woman in the Union Square subway station. Another perp assaulted seven Asian women over just two hours. Poop attacker Frank Abrokwa walked without bail — again, despite multiple arrests just this year. That Adams and his top police brass haven’t yet managed to roll out — or even provide a real timeline for — his new anti-gun units, the Neighborhood Safety Teams, adds more angst among the law-abiding. So does new Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell’s practice of releasing the data without an actual press conference. Recent polling shows that 74% of New Yorkers consider crime a very serious problem (the highest since 1999). Indeed, it’s also respondents’ “most urgent” issue, in many cases by double-digit percentages, across all five boroughs and regardless of party, gender, race or age. Two-thirds worry about becoming crime victims. Possibly the only thing all New Yorkers agree on. Except, apparently, the city’s delegation to the Legislature, which with Gov. Kathy Hochul’s acquiescence continues to stonewall any reform of the no-bail and Raise the Age laws. (And, no, making an exception for crimes involving human feces doesn’t count.) If things don’t change, and soon, the only New Yorkers swaggering will be the gangbangers.
