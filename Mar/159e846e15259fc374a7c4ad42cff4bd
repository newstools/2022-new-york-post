The bubble burst on Sunday for several heartbroken teams. Richmond’s win over Davidson in the Atlantic 10 Championship stole a bid from Dayton on Sunday. They were the first team left out of the 68-team field.  Rutgers, Notre Dame, Wyoming and Indiana earned the final four spots in the 68-team field and are in the First Four in Dayton. Wyoming plays Indiana on Tuesday, while Rutgers plays Notre Dame on Wednesday. Here are the teams that were not so fortunate: Conference: Atlantic 10 Coach: Anthony Grant Wins over Kansas, Miami and Virginia Tech were not enough for a Flyers team that has shown they can lock it down on defense, ranking 13th in points allowed (60.9). They have a freshman leading the way, as the 6-foot-10 Daron Holmes II has been a two-way force inside with strong shot-blocking abilities (2.3 bpg) Conference: Big 12 Coach: Porter Moser The Sooners, led by Eastern Washington transfer Tanner Groves, mostly struggled against top teams and a strong Big 12 tourney was not enough to overcome that. Conference: American Coach: Tim Jankovich AAC Player of the Year Kendric Davis is a backcourt force. He shoots at a high level (19.4 ppg), is a quality distributor (4.5 apg) and is lights-out from the free-throw line (86.1 percent). The 5-foot-11 guard led SMU to three wins in four tries against the league’s other top teams, Memphis and Houston, averaging 22 points in those meetings. Conference: SEC Coach: Buzz Williams The Aggies were 15-2 on Jan. 15 before an eight-game losing streak made another disappointing year for Williams in College Station look imminent. They responded, however, by winning six of seven to close the regular season behind the play of senior guard Quenton Jackson (14.8 ppg), before a strong showing in the SEC Tournament to get in the field.
