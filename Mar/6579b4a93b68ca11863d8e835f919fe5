Paul Manafort, a former adviser and campaign chairman for President Donald Trump, was removed from a Dubai-bound flight over the weekend because he was carrying a revoked passport. M​anafort was pulled off the Emirates Airline flight at Miami International Airport without incident prior to takeoff Sunday, a Miami-Dade police spokesman confirmed to the Associated Press. Detective Alvaro Zabaleta referred other questions to US Customs and Border Protection. Manafort, 72, served as Trump’s campaign chief for several months during the 2016 presidential race but was removed that August after revelations surfaced about his business dealings in Ukraine, where he worked as an adviser to the country’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych. In August 2018, Manafort was convicted by a federal jury on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, with a mistrial declared on 10 other counts related to alleged financial crimes. Prosecutors said Manafort illegally concealed income earned from political work overseas while obtaining millions in bank loans under false pretenses. The following year, Manafort was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released from custody in May 2020 over COVID-19 concerns and placed in home confinement. Trump pardoned Manafort in December 2020, weeks before leaving office.
