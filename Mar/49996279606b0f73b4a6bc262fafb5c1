Hedge fund billionaire John Paulson is still in the midst of a messy divorce — his estranged wife, Jenny, apparently learned that he filed while reading Page Six — and maybe that’s why he sold a stunning Upper East Side condo for $5 million, which is far less than its $24.5 million asking price in 2013. The condo unit, which once operated as an art gallery, is at 11-15 E. 70th St., a landmarked limestone mansion that has been transformed into an exclusive boutique condo beside the Frick Museum. The French Classical mansion was built in 1910 by Charles I. Berg. The 6,500-square-foot duplex — which includes a residential component — once housed the infamous, scandal-plagued Berry-Hill Galleries. When the gallery couldn’t pay its debt, Paulson — a hedge funder who made his name, and fortune, short-selling real estate before the 2008 economic crash — took over the note, according to reports. “It would make a fantastic residence, art gallery or both,” a source said. The buyer is Adam Weitsman, an art-collecting, upstate scrap metal recycling mogul. “It’s not clear what he wants to do with the space yet,” a source close to the crypto-mining entrepreneur said, adding that Weitsman has an extensive art collection and once owned a gallery in Greenwich Village. The duplex comes with a wrought-iron and glass entrance and also boasts a stone balcony above and a rear garden behind. Inside, there are large rooms with 11-foot ceilings, marble and hardwood floors and a marble spiral staircase. The gallery also has office and storage space. This real estate sale is just a drop in the bucket for the Paulsons who are now carving up real estate that includes a $110 million property in Palm Beach, Fla., as well as an Upper East Side mansion and Southampton beach house. The listing broker for the 11-15 E. 70th St. unit was Brown Harris Stevens’ Marci Merzer. Compass’ Rachel Glazer repped the buyer.
