Embattled ex-union boss Ed Mullins was slapped with a $1 million lawsuit Wednesday by the Sergeants Benevolent Association related to charges he allegedly embezzled from the organization. The SBA brought the Manhattan Supreme Court case against Mullins, 60, for his “fraudulent scheme to steal and misappropriate union funds from the membership,” the one-page summons alleges. The union is seeking $1 million and other unspecified damages from Mullins. Federal prosecutors last month brought a criminal case against Mullins, claiming that since 2017, he has been embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the SBA to live large — including buying high-end meals, jewelry, clothing and home appliances. Mullins carried out the theft by allegedly submitting bogus expense reports to be reimbursed by union dues. Since 2017, Mullins submitted reports to the tune of $1 million — most of which were falsified, prosecutors alleged. Mullins also inflated charges on his expense reports so that he could pocket the remainder of his reimbursements and doctored vendor names to make the expenses seem business-related, the feds claim. Mullins resigned and filed for retirement in October following law enforcement raids on his home and union offices. His criminal defense attorney Marc Mukasey declined to comment.
