A girl dubbed “Little Miss Nobody” has been identified some 62 years after her burned body was discovered buried in a remote Arizona desert, authorities said. The Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office will identify the girl Tuesday during a press conference at a community college in Prescott. “The unidentified little girl who won the hearts of Yavapai County in 1960 and who occupied the minds and time of YCSO and partner for 62 years will now rightfully be given her name back and will no longer need to be referred to as Little Miss Nobody,” sheriff officials said in a statement. The girl, believed to be between the ages of 3 and 6, was discovered by a teacher searching for rocks in Sand Creek Wash near Congress in July 1960. She had likely been dead for up to two weeks and her body had been burned, KNXV reported. The girl’s death was ruled a homicide and a set of adult shoe prints were found near the site, but investigators never narrowed down any suspects. The young victim was ultimately identified via DNA analysis conducted by a Texas-based laboratory, according to the station. The girl’s remains were exhumed in 2018 for DNA samples to be retrieved. The girl, who had brown hair and was wearing a checkered shirt at the time, was wearing an adult pair of flip-flops cut down to fit her. She was about 3 feet, 6 inches tall and weighed 55 pounds, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
