Mayor Eric Adams became a TikTok user Monday in a 15-second video posted on the social media platform favored by teenagers. The salubrious 61-year-old retired NYPD captain showcases City Hall’s exterior before blending a smoothie in a NutriBullet in the clip. “Bing bong, New York City,” a casually dressed Adams says, looking at the camera with a grin while holding the mud-colored drink, sipping it from a straw. “Your mayor is on TikTok,” he added. “Let’s get stuff done.” It’s unclear when Adams — who is in Washington, DC, on Monday — filmed the video. Adams, a self-proclaimed plant-based eater, has made healthy eating and his daily nutritious morning smoothies a part of his public persona.
