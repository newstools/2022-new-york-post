Now this is an epic new father fail! Just hours after welcoming a newborn baby boy with her boyfriend, a TikTok mom, known as @Aubrecita, accidentally discovered that her boneheaded beau had been cheating on her with another woman. “Feeding my hours-old baby in the hospital, the nurses had asked me to record the times that he ate, so I [grabbed] my sleeping boyfriend’s phone to check the time,” said the blonde, who works as an OB/GYN sonographer, in a video that’s amassed more than 7.9 million views as of Friday afternoon. The circulating clip then transitions to a snapshot of her unnamed lover’s iPhone home-screen, which featured a picture of their infant son as his screensaver and a new text message notification from a woman named Marissa asking him to “come cuddle.” The screenshot of the damning message shocked and appalled TikTok viewers, most of whom supported the slighted new mommy with encouraging messages like: “I woulda told the nurses to get him out of the room those women always got the mommas backs,” and “God wanted you to see that message as your sign to move on.” One stunned member of the cyber crowd wrote, “Not the picture of the baby on his background,” and emphasized her amazement at the man’s audacity with the hysterically laughing emoji. To that, @Aubrecita replied, “Right like WTF, and he had also texted his friend immediately after I gave birth and said, ‘Baby don’t look like me.’” And when another commentator asked if she’d ultimately forgiven her unfaithful boo, the scorned mom answered with an emphatic “Hell naw, to the naw, naw, naw,” with the help of a viral TikTok soundbite. “No,” she wrote in the closed caption of her response clip. “This happened 9 years ago. I left him, and I’m now married to a man who restored my faith in men.” And now that her womanizing ex and his wandering eye are out of her life, the mom celebrated her freedom underneath her snippet, writing, “One thing I’m incredibly thankful for is that we were never married!!”
