Looks like fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger is getting into the house-flipping business. Nearly three months after shelling out about $31 million for a ski chalet in Aspen, he’s sold the slope-side estate for a whopping $50 million — netting him a $19 million profit. The transaction took place in an off-market deal and closed on March 22, the Wall Street Journal first reported. “With limited inventory, high-net-worth buyers will pay whatever it takes to live the Aspen dream,” Steven Shane, who repped the property with Compass, told The Post. “I have to go off-market to identify unlisted properties that work for my clients. A home in Aspen is an investment in lifestyle. Buyers realize you can’t ski on a Damien Hirst or fly fish shares of Apple stock.” Located on the slope side on the Little Nell ski trail on Aspen Mountain, the property has four bedrooms and nine bathrooms. It spans more than 7,100 square feet. Newly built in 2003, the previous listing described the home as a “one-of-a-kind” ski property on land that has been owned by the same family since the 1950s. It was once listed for rent for a colossal $190,000 per month. Meanwhile, the fashion designer, 71, known for his all-American brand, traded his Connecticut estate for a Palm Beach home last year.
