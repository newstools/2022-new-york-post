It was a mammoth find. New Hampshire fishermen were taken aback after an angling expedition yielded an unexpected catch: a 12,000-year-old fossilized mammoth’s tooth. “It’s in pretty good shape,” Tim Rider, captain of the Portsmouth-based New England Fishmongers, told Seacoastonline of the miraculous find. The commercial anglers reeled up the peculiar by-catch while dredging for scallops off Newburyport, Mass., in December, NBC Boston reported. Rider then brought the 11-inch-long, 7-pound specimen to the University of New Hampshire, where experts identified it as a mammoth’s molar. They estimated that the tooth was between 10,000 and 15,000 years old. “It’s quite big,” said UNH geology professor Will Clyde, who noted that fishermen have reeled in similar fossils, but that Rider’s was one of the best-preserved. He added that the discovery made him imagine the region during the age of the prehistoric herbivore, which went extinct 4,000 years ago. “I always love thinking about the landscape in New England,” said Clyde. “With mammoths and mastodons walking around, and in terms of geological times, that wasn’t that long ago.” The ancient grass grinder is currently on display at Rider’s restaurant in Kittery, Maine. However in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, the kind-hearted scalloper is auctioning the “used” tooth off on eBay, whereupon he’ll donate 100% of the proceeds to the victims. The money will specifically go to World Central Kitchen, a charitable institution founded by celebrity chef José Andrés that serves hot meals to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war zone. As of Friday afternoon, bidding was up to $9,600. “I’m a fisherman, but anytime you see families and children struggling in that type of situation, you really try to be thankful for what you have and do what you can to help,” said Rider. In a similar discovery in June, crews rerouting a gas line in Oregon discovered a 12,000-year-old mammoth’s tusk beneath the roadway.
