Here are three potential targets for the Giants in free agency: Blythe, 29, played in just four games last season for the Chiefs following hernia surgery. Before that, he started 31 games at right guard in two years with the Rams, and in 2021 started 16 games at center. A 2016 seventh-round pick of the Colts out of Iowa, Blythe could challenge for starting spots at center (Nick Gates’ return from leg surgeries is not guaranteed) or at guard. When Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll arrived in Buffalo in 2017, Taylor was the Bills’ starter and went 8-6 and made the playoffs. Taylor, 32, is a classic tweener, not quite starting material, but not an ordinary backup. He is 26-25-1 as a starter with 59 touchdowns and 25 interceptions in his 11-year career. Taylor would be a veteran presence for Daniel Jones and a capable alternative if Jones were to get hurt. The Giants are not going to go into the season with Jones and newly returning Davis Webb as the only two quarterbacks. You must have a tight end, right? Former Giants first-round pick Evan Engram will sign elsewhere and Kyle Rudolph was released. Hurst, 28, is a more-than functional player who was supplanted in Atlanta by Kyle Pitts. Hurst caught 56 passes in 2020, but just 26 last season. He can block in the running game and is a red zone target, with nine touchdowns the past two seasons. Hurst was with the Ravens when Andy Bischoff, the Giants new tight ends coach, was there.
