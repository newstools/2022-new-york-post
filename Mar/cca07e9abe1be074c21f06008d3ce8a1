If there’s anything we learned as of late, it’s that we’re always on the go. Whether it’s a weekend trip, a short trek to a local coffee shop to get things done or even back to the office (a newer phenomenon), a solid carry-all is essential. To maximize your commute, a trusty work tote (or backpack) will hold everything from your over-ear headphones to your tablets and e-readers. Not to mention, it’s something you can stash in your closet to always have in tow. That said, we must talk about a snazzy bag that’s perfect for everyone, regardless of what the day brings: the HP Envy Urban 14 Tote. In a unisex, of-age fashion, it’s currently on sale for just $54, a chunk off the typical $107 price. It’s soft — being extra roomy without a hard shell, so it’s easy to store when you’re finally home — and the minimalist design is one of our favorites. This Herschel lookalike is perfectly tailored for traveling, too, many thanks to the bag’s lockable zipper and an anti-theft RFID-blocking pocket. For its extra security, you don’t have to worry about purchasing additional locks or devices; everything is safe and sound. What’s more, this pocket is especially great for storing more sensitive items like passports, credit cards and boarding passes, making it one of the best commuter packs for airports (and travel in general). Another reason we love HP’s Envy Urban 14 Tote is that it’s waterproof, keeping your laptop, devices and other items dry. The bag is also easy to wear, coming with a detachable cross-body sash aside from its easy-to-carry leather handles. We can go on and on about this handy, reliable tote but we think we made it clear: it’s one of the best out there, so snag it ASAP while it’s still on sale (until March 26).
