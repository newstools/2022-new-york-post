If Freddie Freeman leaves Atlanta and does not land in The Bronx, the Yankees could wind up whiffing on two juicy first base options. The market for the star first baseman is heating up, and a reunion with the Braves or joining the powerful Dodgers are the most likely destinations, MLB Network reported Friday. Also according to MLB Network, the Braves have been in touch with the A’s about Atlanta-native Matt Olson, which is an appealing (if likely expensive in prospect cost) fallback option. Thus, the first base dominos falling could bring Freeman, the five-time All-Star, to Los Angeles, which relied heavily on Albert Pujols at first last season, and Olson to Atlanta — and the Yankees would be empty-handed. The Yankees only have Luke Voit at the position on the 40-man roster, though DJ LeMahieu could man the position. They could be in the market for either Freeman (who is 32 and reportedly should land a six-year deal) or Olson (who is 27 but would come with an astronomical cost in prospects). Anthony Rizzo, the 32-year-old whom the Yankees dealt for at the trade deadline, is still a free agent. It appears the Freeman sweepstakes should help dictate the rest of the first base market. It is still hard to envision the 12-year pro playing anywhere but Atlanta, but the World Champion Braves have not locked him up and reportedly are exploring a Plan B.
