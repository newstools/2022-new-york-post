Katie Meyer’s sister, Samantha, took to Instagram to thank those who’ve supported their family after news of the Stanford soccer goalie’s death. “There are no words,” Samantha wrote Wednesday in a post. “Thank you for all the kindness extended to my family. I’m not ready to post anything big yet. We are broken hearted and love Kat so much.” The university announced the tragic news in a statement Wednesday that Katie Meyer, a 22-year-old senior, was found dead in a campus residence. A cause of death was not listed. In another slide, Meyer’s sister shared a GoFundMe that she said has been started to help with memorial costs. “The outpouring of support is amazing. Thank you all so much for being here for Kat, our family and her friends,” she wrote, adding a selfie of her with Meyer and their other  sister, Siena. Friends, former teammates of Meyer’s and Stanford soccer fans continue to share their condolences on social media. Former Stanford star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Julie Foudy tweeted, “Ahhhh. Sending  to Katie’s family and friends. Heart wrenching. Hug someone close to you. Tell them how much you love them.” Pro soccer player Tegan McGrady tweeted, “Rest Easy  we miss you, fly high angel .. please everyone hug your loved ones today.” On Tuesday, Stanford vice provost for student affairs Susie Brubaker-Cole shared a letter to students and faculty that reported the passing of a then-unnamed undergraduate. To respect the family’s privacy, a cause of death and the student’s identity were not listed in the letter. Stanford has informed students, faculty and staff that counseling and psychological services services are available. Meyer, who majored in international relations and minored in history, was a captain for the Stanford women’s soccer team. She helped lead Stanford to win its third NCAA women’s soccer championship in 2019, with two critical saves in a penalty shootout against North Carolina.
