Fans holding tickets for the Mets’ canceled opener on March 31 will get to use them whenever the team plays its first game at Citi Field this season. Following commissioner Rob Manfred’s announcement this week that MLB has canceled the first two series of the season because of the lockout, the Mets issued guidelines on their website for ticket holders. The Mets were scheduled to open the season at home, against the Nationals and Braves, from March 31 to April 5. Fans holding tickets for the opener can use them for the first ticketed 2022 home game at Citi Field. Tickets previously distributed for the date that becomes the Mets’ home opener will not be valid. They will be treated as an impacted game, meaning credit or a refund will be issued. The April 2-5 games fall into the “impacted” category. All ticket management actions for tickets for impacted games, including ticket forwarding, will be canceled. These tickets will be removed from the buyers’ account and are no longer valid for admission. Additionally, season-ticket holders (including partial plans) with tickets for impacted games will receive credit for all payments made toward these games. Credit is valid toward group and individual tickets to 2022 and ’23 ticketed regular-season home games at Citi Field, subject to availability (blackout dates might apply) and 2023 season-ticket packages. Accounts that prefer a refund instead of credit for impacted games can submit an online request via their My Mets Tickets account. Refund requests can be submitted until Oct. 31.
