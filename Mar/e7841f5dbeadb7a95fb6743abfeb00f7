Video posted on social media Monday morning shows pandemonium breaking out on an escalator in Manhattan’s Grand Central Station — as a wild fight sent frightened riders trying to flee. The incident happened on the No. 7 subway escalators around 9 a.m., according to the straphanger who shot the video and asked to remain anonymous. The video, posted on Instagram on subwaycreatures, shows a fight breaking out near the top of the escalator before one man appears to fall to the metal stairs a few steps down. “It was shocking considering the time and location,” the man who shot the video said. “I could see the helpless fear from the people considering there was nowhere to go.” He said it wasn’t clear why the fight started, but once it did, everyone was pleading with the two men, who appeared homeless, to stop — to no avail. “People started to run back down in terror,” he said. “Some hopped onto the median.” One rider can be seen in the video hopping onto the area between the up and down escalators to get away. One of the men seen in the video was held for questioning once cops arrived, while the other got away, the videographer said. The man who was held was bleeding from the head. An NYPD spokesman said he had no immediate reports on the incident.
