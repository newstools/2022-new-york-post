On TV, Stevie Budd – who lives in a studio apartment and drives a station wagon – is the owner of the rundown Rosebud Motel in Schitt’s Creek. In real life, Emily Hampshire – the actress who plays the show’s flannel-adorned queen of sarcasm – is the new owner of not one, but two homes in Los Angeles. The 40-year-old Montreal native reportedly paid $2.65 million for a corner lot compound in the eclectic enclave of Silver Lake. Lynne Pope, the property’s listing agent, confirmed the November sale. She declined to comment on who the buyer was, citing privacy reasons. Hampshire’s purchase on Redesdale Avenue came with two detached houses and a basement studio. But don’t expect anything close to the size of the gaudy mansion the Rose family is forced to say goodbye to in Season 1. Combined, there’s just 2,096 square feet of living space – most of which could probably be taken up by Moira’s wig collection. The original house, a Spanish-Moorish one-bedroom built in 1927, was one of Silver Lake’s first residences. The other house, built in 1949, is a mid-century one-bedroom abode. Both were recently renovated and it’s not hard to imagine the light, airy look being appreciated by the actress who got her big break on Nickelodeon’s “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” Should Hampshire decide to turn the property into a boutique hotel she’ll be able to provide room service. Both houses boast modern kitchens decked out with Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances. The 9,000 square-foot lot – with sweeping views of the city – probably even has room for a pool. Yes, the best-case scenario is she puts up a vacancy sign and jets off to shoot the Schitt’s Creek movie we’ve all been waiting for.
