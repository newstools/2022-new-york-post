Jets assistant coach John Benton was arrested and charged with driving under the influence late Thursday night. Benton, 58, was pulled over by the New Jersey State Police shortly before midnight Thursday on I-287 in Morristown for a motor vehicle violation. The police suspected he was under the influence and he was subsequently arrested and charged with DUI. Benton was processed and released, according to a police spokesman. “We are aware of the situation and have no further comment,” a Jets spokesman said. Benton is entering his second season with the Jets as the team’s offensive line coach and run game coordinator. Benton has coached in the NFL since 2004, working with the Rams, Texans, Dolphins, Jaguars and 49ers before joining the Jets. Jets coach Robert Saleh brought Benton with him from the 49ers when he was hired in 2021. Benton had spent the previous four years with the 49ers and also coached with Saleh in 2016 with the Jaguars and with the Texans in 2006-10. Benton could face discipline from the NFL under the league’s personal conduct policy.
