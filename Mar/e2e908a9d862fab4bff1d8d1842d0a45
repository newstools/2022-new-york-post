PHOENIX – Knicks injured point guard Derrick Rose released an inspirational video in which he indicates he’s not giving up on returning this season. “The goal is to come back stronger, come back with more knowledge, more discipline, more determination, more willpower,’’ Rose said in the video, which appears to be filmed inside a moving vehicle. “Everything. Because motherf–ker’s think it’s sweet. ‘Ah man you’re having surgery again. You probably think about calling it a wrap.’ Ha ha, jokes on you.” It is believed Rose recited the words on Feb. 25 – the day he underwent another procedure to deal with a skin infection stemming from his late-December ankle surgery. Rose, who hasn’t played since Dec. 16, was set to make his long-awaited comeback last Sunday, but the procedure derailed his return. The Knicks have given no timetable, other than Tom Thibodeau saying Tuesday he will be reevaluated in 7-10 days. He didn’t make the six-game road trip that continues onto Phoenix. Rose’s first stint with the Knicks in 2016-17 ended late in the season with knee surgery, and he’s had multiple similar procedures in his career. The 33-year-old has played just 26 games this season, and his absence is a chief cause to the Knicks’ 2021-22 demise. Rose played at an All-Star level down the stretch last season and the club finished 41-31. The Knicks, who have lost six straight and play the Suns Friday, could be out of the play-in race by the time Rose is ready. There could be a movement by Knicks brass to shut Rose down to play younger players such as rookie PG Miles McBride. Rose has two years left on his contract, though the final year isn’t fully guaranteed.
