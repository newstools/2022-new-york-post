Two people — one of them armed — drove through a security checkpoint at Joint Base Andrews on Sunday night, apparently around the time Vice President Kamala Harris and several cabinet members were there Sunday night. One of the intruders was arrested while the other was still at large as of 11 p.m., according to a statement on the Maryland military facility’s Facebook page. “We can confirm that the individual who was apprehended had a weapon, but no shots have been fired,” the statement said, adding, “there is not an active shooter situation at Joint Base Andrews.” The intruders blew past the checkpoint at the air base’s main gate around 9 p.m. and fled after their vehicle was stopped, officials said. It was unclear what motivated the incident. Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and the cabinet secretaries landed in Maryland at around 9 p.m. after their trip to an event in Selma, Alabama, marking the 57th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” in which police attacked black civil rights marchers. A White House official confirmed to The Washington Post that by about 9:40 p.m. the cabinet members — Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan — had left the base safely.
