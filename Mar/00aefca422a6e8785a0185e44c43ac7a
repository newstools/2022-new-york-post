Harrowing before-and-after photos have captured the deadly devastation inflicted on Ukraine in the last week as Russian forces continue to lay siege to cities across the country. The Kremlin’s escalating shelling attacks on populated areas of Ukraine have destroyed buildings and left rubble strewn across streets and plazas. An airstrike obliterated an administrative building in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, on Tuesday — with the huge blast leaving the central square piled high with debris and burned-out vehicles. Just a day later, one of the buildings at the nearby Karazin Kharkiv National University was left burning after a missile struck. Meanwhile, firefighters in Kyiv were left battling blazes earlier this week when strikes targeted a number of residential buildings. And residential buildings and bridges were destroyed in Irpin, just outside Kyiv, on Tuesday and Wednesday as Russian forces inched closer to Ukraine’s capital city. In addition to the destruction caused by missiles, Ukrainian officials say more than 2,000 civilians have died in the eight days since Vladimir Putin gave the orders to invade.
