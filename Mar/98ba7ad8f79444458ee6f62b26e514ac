Should Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson join the Supreme Court, she’ll be a role model for students seeking careers in the legal profession. So senators this week should ask her views of protesters who shut down a recent Yale Law School discussion on free speech. The Federalist Society event paired Monica Miller of the progressive American Humanist Association and Kristen Waggoner of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom. Yet some 120 students refused to tolerate  anything the ADF (which they deem an anti-LGBT “hate” group because of its religious-liberty work) might say, so they assaulted the event, raising a ruckus and threatening panelists in a bid to silence them. The protesters stomped, shouted, clapped, sang and pounded the walls nearby, making so much noise it disrupted classes, The Washington Free Beacon reports. They also blocked the only exit and grabbed and jostled at least two FedSoc members. Police had to be called to escort panelists safely from the site. Worse, more than 60% of the law school’s student body (the most privileged future lawyers in the land!) signed a letter backing the protesters. “If you can’t talk to your opponents, you can’t be an effective advocate,” notes Miller, the fellow progressive the mob muzzled. If this behavior is allowed, warns Waggoner (and Yale Law’s done nothing about it), “the future of the legal profession in America is in dire straits.” So: Will would-be Supreme Court Justice Jackson condemn the mob and announce that she won’t hire any of its members as clerks? If not, she doesn’t deserve a single senator’s blessing of her ascent.
