Two women were stabbed Saturday afternoon inside the Museum of Modern Art in Midtown, resulting in a chaotic scene that had patrons running for the exits. Police sources said the women’s injuries were not life-threatening. Dozens of people who had been in the museum at the time posted on social media that they were ushered out of the building by security with no explanation. Some of the posts said police arrived at the scene and ran straight to the coat room. The suspect was initially believed to be a man wearing a black hoodie, sources said. The museum could not be immediately reached for comment.
