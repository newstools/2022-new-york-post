One police officer was shot dead and two others were injured while responding to a domestic violence call in a Pennsylvania city Thursday afternoon. Police responded to a call in a residential neighborhood in Lebanon just after 3:30 p.m. that devolved into a gunfight about 50 minutes later, officials said at a press conference. An unnamed 34-year-old male suspect was killed in the shootout along with an officer, whose identity was being withheld until his extended family was notified, police said. One officer was fighting for his life and another was in stable condition, according to Mayor Sherry Capello. “Obviously the incident is still under investigation and details will be forthcoming as that investigation concludes,” Capello said. “At this time we are focused on the tragic loss of the officer and the well-being of the other members of our police department. This is an extremely difficult moment for everyone.” With Post wires
