Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are wasting no time solidifying their future plans together. After months of searching for their perfect home for their blended family, it seems they finally found it. The two lovebirds are in contract to shell out more than $50 million for a massive Bel-Air, Los Angeles, abode spanning nearly 20,000 square feet, according to TMZ. And it looks like, despite the hefty price to be paid, they’re still snagging a deal for the gigantic property, which will offer plenty of room for their children to play. The property first went up for sale in February for a whopping $65 million. In 2016, Todd Lemkin, a Texas hedge fund manager, purchased the traditional home for $27.6 million. So it looks like he is walking away with one heck of a profit — a win-win situation for all. Comprised of 10 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms, the estate sits in a secluded patch surrounded by trees for optimal privacy. Known as “The Bellagio Estate,” the property stands on 1.1 acres of land offering golf course views, the listing notes. The primary suite has been pegged as an “ultimate retreat,” and features a sitting room, and double baths and closets. There is also a two-bedroom staff suite, a main kitchen, a full catering kitchen, and two additional kitchens — one for staff and another in the guest house — the listing explains. Outdoor amenities include a vast lawn with an infinity edge pool and pocket gardens throughout. The Post reached out to Drew Fenton of Hilton & Hyland, who holds the listing, for comment. Affleck, 49, and Lopez, 52, rekindled their romance after nearly two decades, last April. They were spotted last summer looking at $65 million pad in LA’s upscale Holmby Hills neighborhood. Meanwhile, Lopez attempted to sell her New York City penthouse, but she took it off the market after four years without any offers. Lopez shares two children with ex-husband Marc Anthony and Affleck shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner.
