Keeping up with everyday chores is quite the task – even when you live alone. So imagine the stress of tending to the laundry, making the beds and cooking meals when you have 10 young children to look after. Well, that’s the reality for busy mom Tracee Simpson, 33, who lives in the US. But taking to TikTok, she’s revealed the perfect chore chart to keep up with daily demands while having a house-full. Alongside an image of the detailed chart, she explained how her 13-year-old daughter Lila is responsible for washing, drying and sorting laundry. Beau, who is 12, is tasked with tidying the boy’s bathroom and taking out the rubbish, while Ryan, also 12, is asked to sweep the upstairs and do the dishes. Meanwhile, she went on to say Scarlett, aged 11, is responsible for cleaning the big windows, the girl’s bathroom and organizing nappies for the youngest in the brood, Austin. Wyatt and Tootie, who are nine, are responsible for wiping the table cleaning up dog mess and tidying up their younger sibling Remy’s room. Then, twins Rhett and Rhiggs, aged seven, are asked to feed the dogs and tidy the living room. Alongside the short clip, Natalie added: “We pick chores based off their strengths as often as possible!” And many of her social media users were full of praise for the mom-of-10’s clever chore schedule. “I’ve been looking for a chore chart. Thank you for sharing yours,” enthused one. A second added: “Thank you, this help.” Meanwhile, a third questioned: “So, do they just stick with theses chores or do they change?” Natalie added: “And we cycle through chores as needed! Keeping it rotating so no-one gets overwhelmed or burnt out.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
