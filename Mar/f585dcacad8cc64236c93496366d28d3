An e-bike rider was arrested after allegedly hitting two pedestrians in Brooklyn — leaving one critically injured, authorities said. Justin Giaquinto, 50, allegedly hit a 43-year-old woman at the intersection of 19th Avenue and 76th Street in Bensonhurst at around 6 p.m. Friday, according to police. Cops arrived on the scene at 6:11 p.m. to find the woman lying on the roadway with head trauma and a second woman in her forties who’d suffered an injury to her left forearm. An initial investigation found Giaquinto had been traveling on 19th Avenue and “struck the pedestrian while she was crossing the roadway at the intersection of 76 Street,” police said. Giaquinto was uninjured in the crash and booked on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, NYPD said. Both victims were taken to Maimonides Medical Center.
