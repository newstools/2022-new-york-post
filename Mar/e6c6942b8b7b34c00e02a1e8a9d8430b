Hello, Tonys! It’s so nice to have you back where you belong. The 2022 Tony Awards, celebrating the best of Broadway, will go on as normal, with a live telecast Sunday, June 12, on CBS, the American Theatre Wing announced Tuesday. Aside from an hourlong presentation of “exclusive content” on Paramount+, the 75th annual ceremony will once again be broadcast on network TV, from 8 to 11 p.m. Eastern, and be held at Radio City Music Hall. Last year’s pandemic-hobbled show honoring productions from 2019-2020 was delayed till fall 2021, aired mostly on the streaming platform and was held at the more modest Winter Garden Theatre, now home to the revival of “The Music Man” starring Hugh Jackman. In that telecast, most of the nominated musicals performed remotely from their theaters. And even in a much smaller house, not every seat was filled. With more than twice as many eligible new musicals this year, selling Tonys tickets shouldn’t be a problem. Musicals such as “Six,” “Girl From the North Country,” “MJ” and “A Strange Loop” will hope to hear their names when the nominees are announced May 3.
