One young mom has shocked the internet with her uncanny resemblance to her 20-year-old daughter. 27-year-old Savana Chapin has gained a following of over 300 thousand followers on TikTok for sharing videos of her blended family. The mom of five is especially close with her oldest, 20-year-old Tizziana Chapin, who looks just like her. Interestingly enough, the two aren’t actually related by blood; Savana became Tizziana’s stepmom when she married her dad, Chris Chapin. Savana and Chris have a 16-year age gap, which is why Savana and Tizziana are so close in age. At first, Savana said in a Youtube video that it was a little tough for Tizziana to come to terms with her dad dating someone so close in age to her, but eventually, she warmed up. “Now we’re best friends and she’s my little right-hand man,” Savana said. The two’s close relationship is very evident throughout their TikTok pages. The stepmother and daughter duo are constantly making videos of them dancing and joking around. They even joked that Savana will be a grandma by the time she’s 30 years old, and lip-synched the words: “Why not?” In another video of the pair, Savana wrote sarcastically: “When people say we look like twins… Is it the long blonde hair? Cause I don’t see it.” People in the comment section were quick to point out the two’s similarities, like one who wrote: “It’s the face, the eyes, the nose the mouth twins.” Another added: “You definitely look like sisters,” while someone else agreed and commented: “The look-alike is crazy!” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
