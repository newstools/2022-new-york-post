First responders in New Jersey caught a 3-year-old boy who was dropped by his father from the window of a burning apartment building in a dramatic caught-on-camera rescue Monday morning. The dad and son were trapped inside their second-story apartment at the South Ridge Woods complex in South Brunswick when firefighters and police officers got there at about 8:20 a.m., authorities said. But the father busted out the window and dropped his son into the arms of waiting first responders below, according to footage obtained by ABC 7. Once his son was safely outside, the man went headfirst out the window. All of the residents inside the 24-unit building were able to flee the three-alarm fire, according to Monmouth Junction Fire Chief Scott Smith. “This was a total team effort to extinguish this fire and ensure all occupants were able to escape,” Smith said in a statement. A third-floor balcony and portion of a building’s roof collapsed during the blaze. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
