Conor McGregor is in trouble with the law in his native Ireland. The UFC star was arrested in Dublin on Tuesday night for alleged dangerous driving, the Irish Independent reports. According to the report, McGregor’s Bentley was seized by police, though it was eventually returned. McGregor was released on bail. The fighter’s spokesperson Karen Kessler said McGregor was stopped by authorities for “alleged road traffic violations.” “Mr. McGregor was driving to the gym when he was stopped by Gardai for alleged road traffic violations. He passed the drug and alcohol tests taken at the station,” Kessler said, according to ESPN. If convicted, McGregor could face a fine of over $6,600, up to six months in prison — or both. In 2017, he was fined over $500 by the same court for speeding. According to Forbes, McGregor was the highest earning athlete in the world last year, bringing in $180 million. More than 80 percent of that revenue came when McGregor sold his majority stake in his whiskey brand, Proper No. Twelve. Any prison sentence, if it came to that, would be far more significant than a fine. McGregor, 33, fought twice in UFC last year. Both fights were losses to Dustin Poirier. In the second fight, McGregor suffered a broken leg.
