Count Tyler Anderson as the latest casualty of the hot mic. During his Thursday afternoon start, Anderson issued a full count walk to White Sox slugger Jose Abreu, missing inside with a cutter. The Dodgers’ left-hander reacted in peak frustration, unleashing an F-bomb — an outburst that the broadcast picked up on clear as day. “I believe Mr. Anderson wasn’t very happy with himself,” White Sox play-by-play man Jason Benetti quipped. Color commentator Steve Stone shifted the conversation with a playful jab at Benetti. “You know, there was something that he yelled when he delivered that ball,” Stone said. “I’m thinking, you’re a very young man, close your headset, you don’t want to hear that.” Stone, 74, is 36 years older than Benetti, 38. The leadoff walk spurred a three-run inning for Chicago, which knocked Anderson out of the game before he could record an out in the fourth inning. It marked Anderson’s shortest outing of the season. The Dodgers would rally to win the game, 11-9, preserving Anderson’s pristine 7-0 record — F-bombs and all.
