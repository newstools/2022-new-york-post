Oh, fudge! Two employees at a Mars food processing plant in Pennsylvania needed to be rescued after they fell into a tank of chocolate Thursday, according to reports. The pair fell waist-deep into a tank at the candy giant’s facility in Elizabethtown just before 2 p.m., PennLive.com reported, citing Lancaster County dispatchers. The chocolate-coated victims weren’t hurt, but couldn’t get out of the tank on their own, dispatchers told the outlet. They were identified as workers at the facility by WHP-TV. A spokesperson for Mars confirmed that rescue efforts were underway Thursday afternoon. “We can confirm both people have been taken offsite for further evaluation. We’re extremely grateful for the quick work of first responders,” the statement provided to The Post said. A man who answered the phone at the facility on Brown Street said he had no additional information to provide. “I don’t know anything,” he told The Post before abruptly hanging up. Mars produces some of the most iconic treats at its factories, including M&M’s, Snickers and Skittles candies. It’s unclear what brand was connected to the incident.
