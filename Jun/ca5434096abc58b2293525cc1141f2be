An unsettled man climbed onto the tracks at the Washington Square Park subway stop — delaying trains for about an hour as emergency responders convinced him to climb back up, according to cops and witnesses. The 42-year-old jumped down just after 2:30 p.m. and was walking between the north and southbound A/C lines at the West Fourth Street–Washington Square station, authorities said. EMS workers and people on the platform yelled to try to coax the man to come back up onto the platform — with some straphangers even throwing down money to persuade him to climb to safety. The unnamed man, wearing a floral v-neck shirt, can be seen in a video talking to dozens of people on the platform as he paced between the tracks but what he said was inaudible. He eventually decided to come back onto the platform around 3:30 p.m. Cops took the man into custody on pending charges, according to police. No one was injured and the trains returned to normal service moments after the incident had ended.
