Eli Manning officially retired from the NFL in January of 2020 – two years later, the 41-year-old is apparently squashing any rumors of a playing comeback. The longtime Giants quarterback took to Twitter Tuesday to divulge his attempts at staying in shape as a retiree. It does not seem to be going well. “So I thought it would be a good idea to try our old conditioning test for the Giants today,” Manning tweeted to his 457.3k followers. “10 half gassers (run sideline to sideline and back) in 18 seconds. I almost made 9 before I pulled my hammy.” Following the close encounter, it sounds as though Manning will not be trying his old regimen any time soon. “What was I thinking?,” he wrote. “Moron!!” Fans on Twitter were quick to commend Manning’s valiant efforts, while also making sure to wail on the former quarterback and his brother, Peyton. “Never was much of a runner, Champ,” one fan commented, while another tweeted “Don’t sweat it. You still got better hair than Peyton.” Often overlooked amidst Manning’s decorated playing career was his ability to stay on the field. During his 16 seasons with the Giants, the Ole Miss product never missed a game due to injury – his 210 consecutive starts in the NFL remains the third longest streak for any quarterback in NFL history. Manning regularly credited his longevity to a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables and protein, as well as a core-focused workout routine. Now two years dispelled from the NFL, it seems those workouts have gotten more difficult for the Super Bowl-winning quarterback. Perhaps he should stay off the field and stay in the booth as a commentator on Manningcast.
