Billy Horschel crossed off a special bucket list moment after his victory at the Memorial Tournament on Sunday. The pro was greeted on the green by his wife Brittany Horschel and their three young children, Axel, Skylar and Colbie, who ran to their father for a group hug. That was a moment Horschel said he’s “always” wanted throughout his golf career. “It’s sort of a running joke in our family that my wife and my kids have never been at a victory,” said the 35-year-old Horschel, who now has seven PGA Tour wins. “I’ve just always wanted that moment where a family runs out and the kids run out and I can always look back at for many years to come and they can look back at, for their entire life being on the green and congratulating their father for a victory. And so it’s special to have that video and those photos for the rest of our lives.” Cameras captured the family celebrating at Muirfield Village, where Skylar and Colbie danced on the green, and Axel was pointing to the Goodyear Blimp. Horschel got a congratulatory kiss from his wife, before the family eventually boarded a private jet. Horschel — who is in his 13th year on the PGA Tour — put an exclamation point on his victory with a 53-footer eagle putt on the 15th hole. His full circle moment came after he and his wife opened up about a difficult time when Brittany sought treatment for alcoholism in 2016. “‘I am an alcoholic,'” Brittany wrote in a statement. “I say that now without shame. Admitting that to myself, family and friends, has saved my life and my marriage.” The couple opened up about her struggles with alcoholism in a joint interview on “Good Morning America.”
