While the Los Angeles Angels will likely remain in the headlines after suffering a 13th straight defeat, another California team is also having its share of struggles. The Oakland Athletics are on an eight-game losing streak and will now head to Cleveland for a four-game series with the Guardians. The game begins at 7:10 p.m. ET. While the A’s are struggling, the Guardians come into this game playing well. Cleveland is 7-3 in its last 10 games. Over that span, Guardians pitchers are holding their opponents to an average of just .207 and 2.41 runs per nine innings. Those numbers are even more impressive over the last five games, where teams are batting .188 and averaging under two runs per game against Cleveland. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: OAK +1.5 (-130) vs. CLE -1.5 (+110) Moneyline: OAK (+150) vs. CLE (-185) Total: Over 8.5 (-120) | Under 8.5 (+100) James Kaprielian (0-3, 6.06 ERA) vs. Konnor Pilkington (1-0, 2.65 ERA) Right-hander James Kaprielian will get the start for the Athletics. The Guardians will counter with rookie left-hander Konnor Pilkington. Kaprielian is coming off an outing where he allowed four runs in 5 1/3 innings, resulting in a 7-2 loss. It was his third loss of the year, which snapped a string of four straight team wins for the Athletics with him on the mound. However, in two of those starts, Kaprielian did allow at least four earned runs. He’s still winless on the year, and according to FanGraphs, his 5.96 FIP is only marginally better than his 6.06 ERA. The Guardians’ current lineup has only 13 at-bats against Kaprielian, but the numbers aren’t in his favor. Per Baseball Savant, Cleveland has a .333 BA with a .448 wOBA and a .547 xWOBA. In comparison, the Athletics have yet to face Pilkington, and he’ll look to use that unfamiliarity to his advantage. Pilkington is 1-0 with a 2.65 ERA and a 2.20 FIP through six appearances that include three starts. While he can be a bit walk-prone given his 5.29 BB/9 ratio, he’s limited the damage by striking out 12.18 batters per nine innings. It’s worth noting that the Athletics have the sixth-highest strikeout rate in the league at 24.1%. Look for the Guardians to get off to a fast start against the reeling Athletics. According to our ActionLabs database, Cleveland is 3-0 on the first-five innings runline (F5 RL) with Pilkington on the mound this season. In contrast, in Oakland’s last four games, it’s 0-4 on the F5 RL against a starting leftie and 1-8 for a loss of 7.17 units in its previous nine games in this spot. I plan to continue fading Oakland until proven otherwise, so I’ll look to back Cleveland on the -0.5 First 5 Innings runline at -130 or better. Guardians -0.5 First 5 Innings -120 (BetMGM)
