Chris Henry Jr., son of late former Bengals receiver Chris Henry, is on the recruiting trail — accompanied by his adoptive father, Adam “PacMan” Jones. Earlier this week, Henry Jr., a wide receiver in the class of 2026, announced that he has received an offer from Mario Cristobal at the University of Miami. Henry Jr. was joined by Jones, who was a teammate of Chris Henry both on the Cincinnati Bengals and the University of West Virginia. Per 247, Henry Jr. already has seven offers. In addition to Miami, Henry Jr.’s offers include ones from Ohio State — which has been a wide receiver factory in recent years — and West Virginia. Last year, in an interview with Shannon Sharpe, Jones revealed that he had adopted both of Henry’s sons, and described them as “freaks when it comes to sports.” “We love each other hard,” Jones said. “We cry together, we pray together, we do everything together. We all family.” Asked why he decided to adopt the boys, Jones said, “Everybody knew Chris and I were best friends in college. I’m still close with his whole family. I’m still close with Lane, the boys’ mom. We’re inseparable. We were just talking — I said, ‘I’ve got to take the boys so I can take what we’ve done so far and maximize it.’ We’ve been working on this for 3-4 years and finally got it done. For me, it’s heartwarming because I know my man is up there smiling and saying, ‘I really appreciate you.'” In 2009, Chris Henry died at the age of 26, after he fell off the back of a moving pickup truck during a domestic dispute, according to police.
