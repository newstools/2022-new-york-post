The husband of Chicago’s top prosecutor Kim Foxx accused her of slapping him at their home last weekend – prompting a police visit that ended with no arrests, a report said. The Cook County State Attorney’s husband made the 911 call following the alleged June 4 feud at the couple’s suburban Flossmoor residence that was sparked over a social media post, according to police records obtained by WGN-TV. Foxx’s husband told police “that Kimberly got mad about something that was posted on Facebook that he did,” according to the police report. “Kimberly asked him to leave and he refused.” According to her husband, Foxx allegedly grabbed him by the collar and threw his video game controller to the ground, according to documents. He also alleged she slapped him on his left cheek. Foxx told responding officers that “she did put hands on [her husband] but it was only to help guide him out of the house. She never slapped him.” The district attorney said her husband called police “only to hurt her,” cops wrote in the report. The couple’s 19-year-old daughter was home at the time of the incident but told police she only heard yelling. Police wrote they “did not see any evidence to support an arrest in this incident,” in their report, according to the outlet.
