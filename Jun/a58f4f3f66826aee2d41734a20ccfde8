ANAHEIM, Calif. — Max Scherzer’s rehab is progressing faster than perhaps the Mets could have anticipated. The veteran right-hander has been throwing from a mound in his rehab work, according to manager Buck Showalter, and will soon progress to facing hitters in live batting practice. Scherzer was placed on the injured list May 18 with a “moderate to high-grade” oblique strain on the left side. The injury was expected to keep Scherzer sidelined for six to eight weeks. But the fact Scherzer is on the verge of facing live hitters suggests he is ahead of that schedule. After facing live hitters, Scherzer will receive rehab starts in the minor leagues to build up. Jacob deGrom is scheduled for a third throwing session off a mound on Saturday, according to Showalter. The Mets ace returned to the mound last weekend, for his first side session since he was diagnosed in spring training with a stress reaction on his right scapula. The Mets’ rotation was set to receive a boost Friday night, with Tylor Megill set for removal from the injured list to start against the Angels. The right-hander had missed the last month on the IL after he was diagnosed with inflammation in his right biceps. Pete Alonso returned to the starting lineup, at first base, three days after he was drilled in the right hand by a Yu Darvish fastball. Alonso went 1-for-5 with a single and a stolen base in the Mets’ 7-3 win over the Angels. Starling Marte, who had left quadriceps discomfort that forced his removal from action Tuesday, missed a second straight game, but was progressing according to Showalter. Stephen Nogosek was optioned to Triple-A Syarcuse to clear roster space for Megill. Popular announcer Ed Coleman (who retired from WFAN in April) worked the Mets’ radio broadcast Friday night and will return to that role on Saturday. Radio broadcaster Wayne Randazzo was on the Apple TV+ call Friday and will fill in for Gary Cohen in the Mets’ TV booth Saturday on SNY.
