A man stalked and raped a woman at knifepoint inside a Bronx park Tuesday morning in a disturbing daylight attack, police said. The suspect waited in front of the woman’s apartment near Beech Terrace and Beekman Avenue and struck when the 38-year-old victim walked outside at 8:30 a.m., according to the NYPD. The fiend, armed with a knife, forced the woman to walk to St. Mary’s Park, where he brutally raped her and stole her debit card, police said. The rapist ran out of the park westbound on East 141th Street and then used his victim’s debit card to make a $3 purchase at a nearby deli, according to police. The woman received treatment at an area hospital and is in stable condition. Police do not believe the woman and her attacker knew each other. Authorities urged anyone with information in regard to this incident to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
