Forever starts now for Lions quarterback Jared Goff and his longtime girlfriend, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Christen Harper. Harper announced her engagement to Goff on Saturday, revealing in an intimate Instagram video that the 27-year-old quarterback popped the question earlier in the week. “6.16.22 can’t wait for forever with you,” Harper captioned the video, in which the future newlyweds are seen kissing at the beach. Later in the day Saturday, Harper — who has been dating Goff since early 2019 — posted videos from the couple’s sunset engagement, as well as the celebrations afterward. “6.16.22. the best day of my life,” Harper gushed in a separate Instagram Story. Leading up to their engagement, Harper and Goff had been busy jet-setting across the country. They not only enjoyed Memorial Day weekend together in the Hamptons but flew to Florida to celebrate Harper’s appearance in the 2022 edition of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit. Goff, who is gearing up for his second season with the Lions after being traded by the Rams last January, joined Harper on the red carpet in May to commemorate the launch of the newest issue. “I am so humbled, honored and truthfully speechless to be a rookie in @si_swimsuit 2022,” Harper shared on Instagram in May. “Every year SI breaks boundaries and this year is no different. So honored to be included in this group of inspiring women.” Harper’s Sports Illustrated family has continued to celebrate her engagement to Goff, with Camille Kostek and Katie Austin, among others, offering their well-wishes on social media.
