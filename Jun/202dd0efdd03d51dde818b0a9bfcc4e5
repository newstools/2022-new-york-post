Diego Schwartzman’s model girlfriend, Eugenia De Martino, is heating up social media as the Argentine tennis player prepares for Wimbledon. According to her Instagram Story, the model joined Schwartzman in England at Wimbledon — where the No. 12 seed will face American Stefan Kozlov in the first round on Tuesday. De Martino shared photos and videos from inside the All England Club at The Championships — including a photo of the couple walking together. Schwartzman, who was pictured carrying two tennis rackets, was dressed in white playing clothes with a towel draped over his shoulder. The Fila Argentina ambassador, De Martino also snapped a mirror selfie and showed off her toned tummy in a crop top and low-rise printed pants. On Sunday, The Sun published a photo of De Martino all smiles with her bare behind on display in a black thong bodysuit. The blonde beauty modeled a pair of tinted sunglasses with pink frames in the photo, which appeared to be taken in front of a bright yellow background. Schwartzman and De Martino have been dating since at least October 2019, according to posts on her Instagram page — which includes plenty of photos from their world travels together. De Martino, who has over 154,000 Instagram followers, is also an ambassador for Cremas Caviahue, a cruelty-free beauty brand. The Argentine beauty reportedly began her career at age 17 and is currently signed with EP Bookers, a modeling agency based in Argentina. De Martino is also an actress.
