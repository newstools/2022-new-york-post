Could Greg Norman and LIV Golf target the LPGA as well? Karrie Webb, the seven-time major winner, has thought about — and dreaded — the possibility. “I know that he’s had this vendetta against the PGA Tour as long as I’ve known him,” Webb said, according to USA Today Sports. “So I don’t think there would be any changing him. I would just ask him that in his ambition to succeed, that he doesn’t ruin women’s golf in the process.” In the past, Webb said she has turned down big money to take part in South Korean tournaments because there was a conflict with majors. She understands the money could be tough to turn down, particularly the kind that players on the men’s side have taken from LIV to leave the PGA. “I think it would be tempting if it’s life-changing for sure,” she said. “Everyone has to think about that. … I guess what I’ve learned, the fact that I have made a lot of money in my life, is it does make you comfortable; it doesn’t make you happy. “You’ve got to live with whatever decision you make.”
