Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo insisted Wednesday that he is in contact with Texas Department of Public Safety investigators — despite reports his agency isn’t cooperating with a probe into last week’s massacre. “I am in contact with DPS every day,” Arredondo told CNN when asked if he was cooperating with the investigation into the law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School mass shooting. The schools police chief, who was the commanding officer at the time of the massacre, refused to answer any further questions about the tragedy that left 19 students and two teachers dead. Arredondo, as well as local cops, have faced intense scrutiny for deciding not to immediately breach locked classrooms where the gunman was holed up — and instead wait for most of an hour for backup. Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw said last week that Arredondo did not immediately confront the suspect because he “believed that it had transitioned from an active shooter to a barricaded subject.” McCraw said students and teachers had repeatedly begged 911 operators for help while Arredondo told more than a dozen officers to wait in a hallway. Multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News on Tuesday that the Uvalde police and Uvalde school system’s police had stopped cooperating with the state’s probe after McCraw said protocol wasn’t followed and called it the “wrong decision.” A DPS spokesman said Arredondo had given an initial interview but hadn’t responded to a request for a follow-up interview that was made two days ago. Arredondo told CNN he wouldn’t be releasing any further details or making statements while the funerals for the victims were ongoing. “We’re going to be respectful to the family,” he told the outlet. “We’re going to do that eventually. Whenever this is done and the families quit grieving, then we’ll do that obviously.”
