The Lakers spent the hours after the draft adding the sons of NBA legends. The Lakers signed Scotty Pippen Jr. to a two-way contract following the 2022 NBA Draft, as well as Shaquille O’Neal’s son, Shareef. The 21-year-old athlete confirmed the news on social media, and his mother, “Real Housewives of Miami” star Larsa Pippen, couldn’t be more proud. “Congrats my love!!!” Larsa wrote on Instagram. “You’re going to your fav team @lakers I couldn’t be more proud of you.” The television personality, 47, also took to her Instagram Stories to share videos from inside a bash in Chicago, where Larsa’s ex and Bulls legend, Scottie Pippen, was present, along with their children. Scottie, 56, was seen embracing the star of the night, as well as sons Preston, 20, and Justin, 17, in a clip, where the former NBA star appeared to get emotional. Another video featured Pippen Jr. popping a bottle of champagne. “Dreams come true Let’s get to work #lakeshow ,” Pippen Jr. wrote in Twitter and Instagram posts announcing the news. Meanwhile, Scottie posted videos from inside the party on his own Instagram Story, including a snapshot of the family in a prayer circle. The party featured custom “SPJ” cookies with the NBA logo of Jerry West in blue and red, as well as a multi-tiered cake of a ball in a hoop. Celebrity couple Giuliana and Bill Rancic’s RPM Seafood catered the event. Pippen Jr. signed with Klutch Sports in May, the agency founded by LeBron James’ agent, Rich Paul. In addition to Pippen Jr., the Lakers also signed Shareef O’neal, son of team legend Shaquille O’Neal, to a Summer League deal, according to The Athletic, shortly after the 2022 NBA Draft. The Lakers made just one pick in the draft on Thursday, taking Michigan State product Max Christie with the 35th overall pick after acquiring the selection from the Orlando Magic that day.
