Gunfire on a suburban Las Vegas freeway between the Hells Angels and Vagos biker gangs might be tied to the killing of a man several weeks earlier in Southern California, according to a prosecutor. Clark County District Attorney’s chief deputy Danielle Pieper Chio said the April 23 fatal shooting of Hells Angels member James Vincent Dickson at a San Bernardino heavy metal concert might have sparked the Memorial Day weekend exchange of gunfire. “The allegation is that Vagos hit a Hells Angels member (in San Bernardino),” Pieper Chio said, “and that makes this possibly a retaliatory shooting.” News reports state four members were injured, including a band member playing at the time. No arrests have been reported in the San Bernardino case and police there declined to comment on their investigation. The mid-day shootout in Henderson, 17 miles from the center of Las Vegas, between the two motorcycle gangs left seven people injured Sunday, authorities said. Richard John Devries, 66, Russell Smith, 46, and Stephen Alo, 26, were arraigned Thursday on multiple charges of attempted murder, among other charges. Devries is the Las Vegas chapter president of Hells Angels and the two other men arraigned were recruits, police said. Bail for each man was $380,000. An anonymous witness, according to police reports, provided video that showed three men wearing Hells Angels apparel riding up to the Vagos members before shots rang out on US-95. More than a dozen shots were fired and one bullet even hit a nearby church, Piper Chio said. No Vagas members have been charged so far. Devries’ attorney Richard Schonfeld told the judge during the arraignment that his client was a military veteran with a clean record. He added there is no evidence he fired a gun. Outside of court, Schonfeld would not say if Devries led the Hells Angels in Las Vegas. With Post Wires
