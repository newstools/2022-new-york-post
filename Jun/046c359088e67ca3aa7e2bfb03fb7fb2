Gerrit Cole’s wife Amy “loved every minute” of pal Kate Upton’s 30th birthday festivities. On Tuesday, Amy posted a collection of photos from Upton’s epic trip to St. Barths, where the wife of Astros pitcher Justin Verlander celebrated the next decade of her life in epic fashion. “Kate’s 30th st. barthsday bash!” the wife of the Yankees’ ace posted on Instagram. In the photos, birthday girl Upton — who turned 30 on June 10 — is seen soaking up the sun with her gal pals before the group slips into their party dresses for a night out. Much like Amy, Upton also recapped the unforgettable getaway on social media by posting a video of the trip on her Instagram page. “It was perfect,” the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model captioned the clip, to which Amy replied, “Loved every minute!” Upton’s friendship with Amy dates back years, as their husbands were teammates on the Astros. Back in October 2019, the dynamic duo recreated their spouses’ Sports Illustrated cover by mimicking the pitchers’ poses from inside a suite. “It’s a Ver-y Cole world Upton here!” Upton quipped on Instagram at the time. Two months later, however, the Yankees signed Cole to a record-setting nine-year contract worth $324 million. Amy later posted a touching tribute to her Houston family as the couple readied for their next MLB chapter in New York. “We will always remember Houston as a happy home, and we’re so grateful to the city, its team, and its people for making us one of their own,” she wrote at the time. “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for everything.” Since making New York their home, Amy frequently cheers on Cole at Yankee games, along with son Caden, whom the couple welcomed in June 2020.
