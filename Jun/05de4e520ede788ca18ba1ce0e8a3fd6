A 61-year-old woman jumped to her death Friday from an Upper West Side apartment building across the street from the American Museum of Natural History, cops said. The woman, whose name was not immediately released, was discovered unresponsive in front of the 15-story apartment building on West 77th Street near Central Park West around 5:30 a.m., authorities said. Investigators determined that she appeared to have jumped from the building, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The pre-war landmarked building is part of the Upper West Side-Central Park West Historic District.
