Giving birth is one of the most trying experiences a person can go through. It takes much mental and physical strength, and afterward, most mothers just want to relax. Samantha Barlow, who goes by @samanthabarlow863 on TikTok, said she, unfortunately, had to deal with a very embarrassing situation post-labor. In a viral clip, she said that while giving birth to her second baby, she had an episiotomy and had to get stitched up afterward. “So, I handed my baby over to daddy, who lovingly took a picture and sent it to his mom. “Super cute, right? Super proud of his little boy.” Her husband’s mother excitedly sent the photo to the entire family group chat. “Which is fine, it’s a super cute baby,” she said. The only problem was that the photo was live ­– meaning it plays a mini video if you press and hold it on an Apple device – and it revealed something pretty shocking at the end. “Right at the last second, my husband tilted the phone up to show me, laying butt naked, spread-eagle, getting stitched up on a bed. “That picture got sent to all of my brother-in-laws [sic], my father-in-law, and my sister-in-law, who opened it in her high school science class and realized it was a live picture.” By the time the woman’s husband realized what he captured, his mom said she had already circulated the photo around the family. “At any point, any of them could have pushed that live photo because it was a photo of a baby and seen me butt-naked.” Viewers found the story equally hilarious and cringe-worthy. “I would never go to family events ever again,” one person joked. “And this is why I had a STRICT rule that not one photo got shared until I SAW THEM ALL,” added another.
