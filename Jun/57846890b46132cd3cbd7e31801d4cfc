Judgment day is here. Today, Aaron Judge’s arbitration hearing is scheduled to take place. Today, the MVP candidate who capped last night’s comeback 7-6 win over the Astros with a walk-off hit will battle with the team he does battle for every game. Barring a last-minute settlement, the team worth approximately $6 billion will insult its most beloved player — as the generational star it hopes to soon sign to a long-term contract listens via Zoom — to save $4 million. This is actually happening. Judge is seeking a $21 million salary this season. The Yankees countered at $17 million. The arbitration panel is prohibited from factoring in the slugger’s incredible 2022 season to reach its verdict, but it is bizarre that the Steinbrenners are pretending the team’s historic season isn’t happening.
