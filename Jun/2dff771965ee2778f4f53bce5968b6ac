NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller is stepping down from the position he’s held for nearly a decade, police officials confirmed. Miller became the NYPD’s counterterrorism chief in 2013.  He also served double-duty as Deputy Commissioner of Public Information starting in 2021 under Mayor Eric Adams and then-Police Commissioner Dermot Shea. Miller is frequently the first official to speak at possible terrorism-related news events, including the mass shooting of 10 people on a Brooklyn subway on April 12. Before taking his current job, Miller was best known for his time discussing national security and crime on “CBS This Morning” and “CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley.” Miller came under scrutiny after he made comments at a City Council hearing earlier this year claiming the department never surveilled Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks. Police sources said Miller had landed a new gig in television, but Miller didn’t return calls seeking comment.
