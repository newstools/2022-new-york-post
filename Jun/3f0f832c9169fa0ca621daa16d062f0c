ANAHEIM, Calif. — After losing a close election last fall for mayor in his hometown of Stamford, Conn., Bobby Valentine had to figure out what came next. The 72-year-old former Mets manager had been away from the baseball scene for almost a decade after becoming athletic director at Sacred Heart University. Ultimately, his heart took him back to his baseball passion. Valentine has relocated to Southern California, where he serves as a pregame and postgame analyst for Bally Sports West’s Angels coverage. Angels general manager Perry Minasian is a longtime friend; Minasian’s father, Zack, was a clubhouse manager in Texas during Valentine’s tenure as manager of the Rangers. As the Mets prepare to face the Angels (who snapped a 14-game losing streak Thursday night) in a three-game set this weekend, Post Sports+ caught up with Valentine.
