Here’s where to get the royal treatment in the Big Apple this weekend. Royal family fans are going nuts for the Queen’s Jubilee at British pubs and eateries in New York City — with one establishment offering screenings, a build-your-own crown station and “Queen for a Day” contest. Tea & Sympathy, which serves British comfort food in the West Village, is throwing an all-out bash beginning Saturday morning with live music and a competition to dress up like a monarch and win a prize. To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s record seven decades on the throne, the restaurant will offer an outdoor viewing of Jubilee events, including the Epsom Derby horse race, workers said. “I just think it’s a fantastic celebration of 70 years of service to our country,” said Stephanie Kessell, a 34-year-old British transplant who works at the restaurant. Festivities, which begin at 9:30 a.m., will also include a “Coronation Station” where folks can build a crown out of paper and stick-on jewels. The jazz band Max Dolgin Trio Plus will play a set and the eatery will give away free Chapel Down’s Brut Rose — the wine served at Prince William’s and Kate Middleton’s wedding — along with Union Jack-shaped crackers, workers said. The restaurant will also serve traditional Jubilee pudding, a British dessert made of sponge cake and lemon curd. Dan Howarth, 33, creative consultant from England, called it a taste of home. “It’s important to celebrate such milestones. We can’t join the celebrations at home, but we can be here,” he said. On Friday, the eatery hung British flags outside and had decorated the joint with a cardboard cut-out of the 96-year-old monarch. “It will be busy tomorrow,” said Nicky Perry, the restaurant’s owner. “People love it when you have a bit of a party. The traditional British Dance troupe, the Bouwerie Boys Morris Dancers, will also perform outside starting at 11 a.m. along with a jazz band on Sunday.
