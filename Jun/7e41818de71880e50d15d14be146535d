This wasn’t the break-up vacation she imagined. While some people take a trip to get away after a relationship ends, one woman got stuck with her ex on vacation. TikTok user @sadgirlhours3344 posted about the unusual scenario in her now-viral video, which has been viewed over 12 million times since it was posted just over two weeks ago. “When you break up, but the trip was non-refundable,” she wrote on the clip. “Two-week vaca!!!!!” In the video, the woman films herself on a beach chair holding a champagne glass before panning over to show her ex-boyfriend sitting next to her near the ocean. “We broke up before the trip,” she explained in a comment. “The trip was non-refundable. We went on said trip.” “October planning brings May trauma,” she added in another video. Thousands of TikTok users commented on the video, many in disbelief that she still went through with the holiday. “I’ve learned from experience not to book vacations with bfs too far in advance,” another wrote. “Lmao at least he didn’t ask you for your ticket so he could take his new girlfriend,” one user commented. Some TikTok users are convinced it’s a sign the pair are meant to be together, flooding the comments with pleas for the duo to get back together. “This is how me and my boyfriend got back together, it’s usually a good thing lol,” a TikToker commented. “It’s weird to try to push people together and y’all act like it’s normal,” another pointed out, with others agreeing there’s “probably a reason they broke up in the first place.” “Y’all not understanding if they broke up it was prolly for a reason,” another user wrote, with many agreeing. Some questioned whether or not it was a joke, with some users commenting saying she posted it with the intention of it going viral, which the user addressed in a series of clips using soundbites. “I made the video w out any intention of it blowing up,” she wrote in a recent video. “I never made anything up. I don’t care that much.”
