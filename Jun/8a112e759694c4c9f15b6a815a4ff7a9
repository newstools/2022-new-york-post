 One of Jadeveon Clowney’s reason’s for returning to the Cleveland Browns might not work out for this coming season. “I thought I played well here last year, and I feel like I can get better and pick off from what I did last year,” he said Thursday. “Then my boy came here, Deshaun.” That would be Deshaun Watson, the quarterback currently facing 24 civil lawsuits over accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct during massages. The Browns traded for Watson this spring and then gave him a fully guaranteed five-year, $230 million deal. It may be a while before the quarterback can suit up for Cleveland — he was cleared of criminal charges, though the NFL is investigating the allegations made against him. The litany of off-the-field issues haven’t seemed to dissuade Clowney from wanting to play with his ex-Houston Texans teammate, though. “I was all about where my boy Deshaun was going,” Clowney said. “I just wanted to go play with him and see what I can do with him again.” “I told him if he goes [to Cleveland], then I will follow him over here. That’s what it came down to.” Clowney starred alongside All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett with the Browns last season, parlaying that success into a one-year, $10 million deal. Even if Watson doesn’t get to play this season, Clowned is excited about the Browns’ potential. “We’ve got a good defense, we can hold it together,” Clowney said. “We did good last year, and we were banged up on offense all over the place and our defense played well for what we had going on. … We’re going to be all right.”
