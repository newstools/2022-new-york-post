Daniil Medvedev and his coach might have to mend fences after an on-court outburst. The world No. 1 threw a temper tantrum on Sunday before he collapsed to a 6-1, 6-4 loss to Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz in the Halle Open Final. Medvedev’s coach Gilles Cervara didn’t look happy after the Russian player appeared to yell in his direction early in the second set. Cervara grabbed his bag and exited OWL Arena in Germany, as the crowd applauded. Medvedev’ lost it when Hurkacz broke his serve in the first game of the second set. Cameras captured Medvedev shouting toward his player box, where Cervara was seated directly in front of Medvedev’s wife, Daria Medvedeva. Medvedev angrily smashed his racket off the court, according to multiple reports, after he shook hands with Hurkacz at the net following the loss. Medvedev later apologized for “not making this match longer and more interesting” and said he was “not easy to be with on the court” this week. He also thanked his wife for her continued support. “Daria, thanks a lot for this week,” he said after the loss — his second straight in a final in seven days. “Not easy to be with me on the court sometimes but hopefully next time will be easier and much better.” This isn’t the first time Cervara exited during a match after a fiery exchange with the Russian star. The coach left midway through one of Medvedev’s matches at the 2021 Australian Open last February.
