Former President Donald Trump, his daughter Ivanka and son Don Jr. have agreed to give sworn testimony next month as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into the Trump Organization. The Trumps will start giving depositions on July 15 — unless an appeals court rules in their favor first and halts the testimony, new court papers show. The depositions are slated to last through the following week, the filing shows. The agreement for the family to testify — which was approved by a Manhattan judge Wednesday — comes after the Trumps lost an appeal last month seeking to stop the depositions from going forward However, they could still try to bring their case to New York’s Court of Appeals – the highest court in the state – to try to overturn that decision. James launched her probe of the family real estate company in 2019 following Congressional testimony from Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, claiming that the former president had exaggerated the value of company assets for insurance, tax and loan purposes. The AG then filed suit in 2020 claiming the company and the family were stonewalling her investigation. A judge in the case issued a civil contempt order against Trump in April for missing a March 31 deadline to respond to a document subpoena from James’ office. That has since been conditionally lifted, with Trump paying a $110,000 fine that is being held in escrow. On Wednesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron declined to close out the contempt order until Trump’s lawyers turn over additional affidavits from Trump Org. employees about their document retention and destruction policy.
