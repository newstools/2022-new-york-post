“Anchorman” actor David Koechner was slapped with another DUI offense last weekend — months after he was charged with a drunken hit and run, according to reports. The 59-year-old’s latest bust came in Southern Ohio just after 2 a.m. on June 4 while he was on tour, TMZ reported. Koechner was seen swerving before a state trooper pulled him over and allegedly smelled alcohol on his breath, sources told the outlet. He was ticketed and is expected to make a court appearance next month. Koechner was in Ohio as part of his “The Office” trivia tour, and had a show later that night in Ironton, according to TMZ. In April, the former SNL cast member was hit with DUI and hit-and-run charges in California stemming from his December 2021 arrest on New Year’s Eve, when police said he was driving erratically and hit a stop sign. The actor and comedian filed for divorce from wife Leigh Koechner in January 2020 after nearly 22 years of marriage.
