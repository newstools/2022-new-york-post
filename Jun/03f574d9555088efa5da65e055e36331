Citizens Budget Commission chief Andrew Rein rightly calls on Mayor Eric Adams to put more than half of $4.5 billion in newfound revenue (over two years) into reserve funds to ensure that essential public services are protected when the next recession hits. We’d be happy if Adams sets aside even more than the $2.3 billion, plus $1.7 billion to the labor reserve to cover the cost of future collective bargaining increases, that the CBC calls for. All signs are that a slowdown is coming (if it’s not already here). And Adams himself joined the CBC in slamming the last mayor in 2021 for only socking away a measly $493 million in the city’s Rainy Day Fund and spending nearly all the federal COVID-relief windfall. Start saving, Mr. Mayor. The city will be grateful you did.
