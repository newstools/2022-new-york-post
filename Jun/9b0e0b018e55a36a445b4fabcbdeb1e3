A 34-year-old man was shot in the leg when he resisted a car thief in Staten Island Sunday morning, cops said. The victim had just left a deli at 220 Port Richmond Avenue around 2:30 a.m. and was getting into his black Infiniti SUV when he was confronted by a gunman. The victim was shot in the left leg when he resisted the attempt to boost his ride, a police spokeswoman said. The thief fled the scene with the victim’s vehicle and was last tracked driving over the Verrazzano Bridge, police sources said.
