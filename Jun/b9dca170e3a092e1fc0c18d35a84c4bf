A doctor and two were nurses were stabbed and critically injured by a man who barged into a Los Angeles hospital on Friday afternoon, authorities said. The attack occurred at Encino Hospital Medical Center just before 4 p.m. and the suspect remained inside the hospital for over two hours before he was taken into custody by a SWAT team, police said. Benjamin Roman, an ultrasound technician, told KNBC-TV, that he saw the doctor and one of the nurses who were stabbed. “The doctor looked (like) she was in pain,” he told the outlet. “There was a lot of blood and it looked like … he might have got her abdomen.” The three victims were hospitalized in critical condition, but were later reported to be stable. It was not immediately clear what led to the attack, and the identities of the victims and suspects were not released. With Post wires
