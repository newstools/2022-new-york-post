A 17-year-old Bronx mom has been charged with murdering her newborn son — who she threw out a window in October, authorities say. The teen tossed her day-old child out of her fifth-floor apartment window on East 158th Street on Oct. 24, police said. Police were initially called to Lincoln Medical Center around 3 p.m., when the teen told them she had previously given birth inside her apartment. Authorities searched the area and found the infant unconscious and unresponsive inside a flowerbed, cops said. He was pronounced dead at the scene by EMS. His death was ruled a homicide by the city Medical Examiner’s Effice. The young mother, whose name was not released, was arrested Thursday and charged with murder and manslaughter, cops said.
