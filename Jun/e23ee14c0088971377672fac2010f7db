Two Little Red Hens crossed the road — but it took the popular Upper East Side bakery two years to make the trip. The cupcakes-and-pastries mecca on upper Second Avenue was forced to close early in the pandemic. The owner searched high and low for a suitable new location with the aid of indefatigable broker Stacey Kelz of Stacey-Robins Realty. They found a new home at last right across the street at 1641 Second Ave. at East 85th Street in the space previously occupied by cocktail bar The Daisy. Two Little Red Hens will have 1,800 square feet of corner ground floor space compared to only 1,000 at its old spot midblock. Newmark’s Jason Pruger and Adam Weinblatt repped building owner Maxx Properties. The asking rent was $205 per square foot. The deal reflects ongoing stabilization of the Manhattan retail leasing market. Newmark Research reports more than 520,000 square feet leased in the first quarter, including three transactions of over 25,000 square feet.
