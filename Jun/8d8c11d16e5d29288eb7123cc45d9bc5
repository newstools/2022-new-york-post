An unhinged man stabbed both of his parents during a fight in their Brooklyn home late Tuesday, cops said. The 24-year-old man was just released from the Kings County Hospital Center and returned to his Bergen Cove home near East 73rd Street in Bergen Beach around 10 p.m., when he got into a dispute with his 51-year-old mother, cops said. During the fight, the crazed son stabbed his mom multiple times in the face, authorities said. When the attacker’s 64-year-old dad intervened, he then stabbed him multiple times as well, cops said. Both parents were taken to Brookdale University Hospital Center with non-life-threatening injuries, cops said. The suspect was taken to the same hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, cops said. It is unclear whether he was at the Kings County Hospital Center previously for psychiatric or other reasons. Charges are pending against him, and his name was not immediately released.
