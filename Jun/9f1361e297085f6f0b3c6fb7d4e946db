The Force has awakened in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a shout-out to “Star Wars” and compared Russia to the movie franchise’s arch villains this week while appearing as a hologram during the VivaTech trade show in Paris. “It’s unusual for presidents or heads of government to use a hologram to address people, but this is not the only aspect of ‘Star Wars’ that we are putting into practice,” Zelensky said Thursday. He also explained that Ukraine is offering technology firms a shot to help rebuild the country into what he predicted would be a fully digital democracy, The Times of Israel reported. “We will defeat the empire too,” he said, comparing Russian forces to the “Evil Empire” in the “Star Wars” franchise. Ukraine has scored praise for its use of technology during its war with Russia, using crypto communities to raise funds and even successfully appealing to Elon Musk to supply the infrastructure for satellite-based internet services, The Times of Israel said. “No other country in the world will offer you such a chance to use the most advanced technologies at a state level,” the president said.
