Kyrie Irving chose a $36.9 million salary in Brooklyn for 2022-23 over taking $30 million less to reunite with LeBron James in Los Angeles. That’s what they call a bluff gone wrong. About 48 hours before his opt-out decision was due, Irving announced a decision to exercise his player option to stay alongside Kevin Durant with the Nets. His camp had been granted permission by the Nets to find sign-and-trade scenarios, but none materialized, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. “Normal people keep the world going, but those who dare to be different lead us into tomorrow,” Irving said in a statement to The Athletic’s Shams Charania. “I’ve made my decision to opt in. See you in the fall.”
