Want to go yachting in style this summer? Now you can, even if you don’t have a mega-yacht to party on — so long as you have a pool, lake or body of water nearby. FUNBOY, makers of all things pool floats and summer fun, has teamed up with Aviator Nation to create a retro version of their bestselling yacht-shaped pool floaty. The FUNBOY x Aviator Nation Yacht ($110) combines bright rainbow colors with fun Aviator Nation artwork printed in shimmering metallics to bring you the most colorful and fun floaty of summer 2022. Like the iconic original yacht float, it is big enough for two people to lay and lounge comfortably, with two cup holders on either side so you can sail and sip under the sun. The front of the boat also doubles as a cooler, so you can load it with ice, drinks and snacks to elevate your yachting experience even more. Want double the fun? That’s easy for us, as FUNBOY is also selling the limited-edition collaboration in a two-pack, with a pair of Aviator Nation yachts for $199, on sale from the original $299. Regardless if you get one boat or a whole fleet, we recommend acting fast before these boats set sail and leave the site for good. For more content, check out the New York Post Shopping section.
