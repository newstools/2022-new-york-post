A perv molested a 17-year-old boy on a Brooklyn train platform, cops said early Wednesday. The teen was waiting for a southbound R train at the 59th Street station in Sunset Park around 7:10 a.m. May 19 when a stranger walked up to him and asked, “How big?,” pointing to the victim’s private area, authorities said. The suspect then grabbed the teen’s penis over his clothing, police said. The victim boarded an R train that pulled into the station, leaving the suspect behind on the platform, police said. He did not report any physical injuries. Police are still looking to track down the creep, described as about 30 years old, 5 feet 5, with a light complexion and medium build, last seen wearing a blue baseball hat, black face mask, black and gray hooded jacket, black shirt and blue jeans. Authorities released a photo of him Wednesday morning. Also last month, a man exposed himself and masturbated in front of a 17-year-old girl on a Manhattan-bound 7 train in Woodside, Queens.
