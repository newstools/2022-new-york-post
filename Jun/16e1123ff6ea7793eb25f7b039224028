A 62-year-old man was found dead within steps of Times Square. The body was discovered outside a pharmacy at 1430 Broadway on the southeast corner of Broadway and 40th Street Saturday morning, and cops are probing the circumstances behind the creepy find. The deceased “had a cough” before he died, said cops, who were called to the scene at 9:36 a.m. Police sources said there were no signs of trauma to the body and authorities suspect the man was homeless. Cops found drug paraphernalia at the scene near the body, the sources said. The dead man’s name has not been released, pending family notification. Police cordoned off the area in front of the Duane Reade pharmacy and placed a sheet over the unidentified corpse. A bag and a baseball style cap could be seen nearby as cops guarded the area. A Duane Reade worker who answered the phone at the Broadway location Saturday afternoon declined comment.
