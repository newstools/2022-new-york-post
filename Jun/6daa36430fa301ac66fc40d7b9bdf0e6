A 12-game losing streak cost Joe Maddon his job. The Angels announced they fired Maddon on Tuesday. Phil Nevin, the former Yankees third-base coach, was named the interim manager. Maddon, 68, told The Athletic the firing surprised him “a lot” but that the move was also “liberating.” Maddon was hired by the Angels after the 2019 season. He finished with a 130-148 in parts of three seasons in Anaheim. The Angels were off to a good start this year and seemed like they’d finally get back to the playoffs for the first time since 2014, but the 12-game losing streak put the franchise at a crossroads. While Maddon told The Athletic believed he and Angels GM Perry Minasian “were working really well together,” he said he conveyed to Minasian a displeasure about leaning too far into analytics. “It’s been kind of difficult overall,” Maddon told the website. “I’m into analytics, but not to the point where everybody wants to shove it down your throat. Real baseball people have felt somewhat impacted by all of this. You’re unable to just go to the ballpark and have some fun and play baseball. It’s too much controlled by front offices these days. “I actually talked to Perry about this. This isn’t anything new. I told him that. I said you just try to reduce the information you’re giving, try to be aware of who’s giving the information and really be aware of when it’s time to stay out of the away. In general the industry has gone too far in that direction and that’s part of the reason people are into our game as much as they have been.” Maddon leds the Cubs to their curse-breaking World Series win in 2016. He’s the second MLB manager to be fired this season as the Phillies dumped Joe Girardi on Friday, and he still wants to manage. “Of course. Of course I want to manage,” Maddon told The Athletic. “I’m really good at it.”
