Lamar Jackson has officially made it to Baltimore Ravens minicamp. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh told reporters last week he was expecting Jackson to show up at minicamp. Still, speculation had grown over whether or not Jackson would arrive following his OTA absence. On Monday, the growing unease was put to rest. The superstar quarterback was first spotted by teammate Marlon Humphrey. The cornerback posted a video on his Instagram story saying, “Y’all won’t believe who I’m with,” before panning the camera to show Jackson beside him. Soon after being spotted by Humphrey, the Ravens tweeted a video of Lamar Jackson in uniform saying, “I hope you’re ready for the season.” Jackson has drawn plenty of criticism for skipping out on OTAs, notably from Chris Simms of Pro Football Talk. Jackson replied by telling the show to, “find something else to talk about,” while emphasizing that OTAs are voluntary. The 2019 MVP is notably heading into the final year of his contract without any extension negotiations taking place. The Ravens have been eager to initiate conversations, but it appears Jackson wishes to wait until his contract expires to start talking. In 12 games last season, Jackson threw for 2,882 yards with 16 touchdowns and 13 interceptions while also rushing for 767 yards with two touchdowns.
