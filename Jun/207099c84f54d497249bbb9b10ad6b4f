Eagle-eyed viewers may notice something isn’t quite right about this rainy image. According to a Tiktoker who shared the apparent optical illusion, only one percent of people will be able to tell what’s up with it. The image shows a group of people waiting for a bus in the rain. All seems rather normal, until you look a bit closer. “Only one percent of people can find what’s wrong with this image, it’s not easy,” HecticNick explains. If you haven’t spotted it yourself, the commenters on TikTok can definitely point you in the right direction. “There’s water in the places people are standing with a umbrella,” one said. But more specifically, it’s the lady in the red dress who is the odd one out. “The woman with the red dress doesn’t have an umbrella but she is not wet,” another user reveals. That’s correct – it looks like she’s holding an umbrella but it actually belongs to someone behind her. More than 27,000 people have shared their comments on the viral video. It’s also been liked more than 182,000 times. Others were less convinced it is just about the woman in the red dress though. One said: “For me it’s that there’s no road.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
