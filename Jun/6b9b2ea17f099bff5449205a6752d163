A Texas mother reported her son to police this week, after he told her he had sexually assaulted one of their neighbors. Gino Anthony Bononcini, 29, was arrested in San Antonio Friday and charged with sexual assault and burglary, according to a report. Bononcini allegedly broke into the home of a 68-year-old neighbor and sexually assaulted her in April, police said. It was the mother’s statement that allowed authorities to seek a judge’s permission for a cheek swab, said Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar. The DNA was then compared with evidence police found at the crime scene where it was a match. After the results came back Friday, police moved to arrest Bononcini.
