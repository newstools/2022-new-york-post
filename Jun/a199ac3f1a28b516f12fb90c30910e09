A callous Queens thief on a motorcycle snatched a dog off the street from a 75-year-old man in broad daylight, shocking video shows. The senior was with his pup around 2:20 p.m. Saturday at 95th Avenue and 88th Street in Ozone Park when the suspect approached and started petting him, according to cops and video posted to the Facebook page for the Ozone Park Residents Block Association. The gray and white mini pit bull, named Off White, is less than a year old, the victim, Carlos Gil, told WABC. Then the suspect suddenly swept the dog into his arms and began revving his engine in an attempt to take off, the clip shows. Gil tried in vain to block the pet-napper’s path, but he got away – driving along the sidewalk while still holding the pup. A second dog can be seen in the clip running up the steps on a front stoop just as the suspect grabbed Off White. Off White belongs to one of Gil’s relatives, a 52-year-old woman, cops said. “When he took off on his bike, I tried to push him,” Gil told WABC in Spanish. “He rushed away, but I thought he was going to hit a pole. Because I wanted to take him out.” No arrests have been made. In a statement, the Ozone Park Residents Block Association described the midday theft as “appalling,” and said it happened in front of the victim’s house. “We condemn the actions of this perpetrator and coward that preyed on a senior and stole his dog,” the statement said. “These acts of cowardness can not go unpunished, and this perp MUST be brought to justice.” The stolen pup is worth $800, according to police – but the family feels they lost something more valuable. “We really would just like to get the dog back,” relative Alonso Gil told WABC. “It’s very much a part of the family, and it’s just very sad to know that he’s gone.”
