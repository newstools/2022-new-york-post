Two strangers repeatedly stabbed a 16-year-old boy inside a Brooklyn subway station over the weekend, cops said Wednesday. The teen was waiting to board a southbound A train at Broadway Junction around 10:20 p.m. Sunday when the two men approached him, one of them asking, “What are you looking at?” police said. The question sparked a fight that turned violent when the suspects pulled out a knife and stabbed the boy “multiple times” in the face and neck, cops said. The pair then fled on separate C and A trains, authorities said. The victim was taken to Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition. Police released surveillance photos of the two alleged attackers early Wednesday.
