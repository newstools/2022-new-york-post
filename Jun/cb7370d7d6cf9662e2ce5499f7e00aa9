Dejounte Murray has his popcorn ready as trade rumors swirl about his future with the Spurs. “Uh Ohhhhhhhhh,” Murray tweeted Wednesday, with a popcorn emoji, in response to a post by Bleacher Report that stated the Spurs and Hawks have discussed a trade centered around him and Hawks forward John Collins. However, sources said “it will take a Jrue Holiday-like package” to acquire Murray — a first-round pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. The Bucks acquired Holiday in four-team deal in Nov. 2020, along with Sam Merrill, the 60th overall pick in the 2020 Draft, in exchange for Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, three future first-round picks and two additional draft pick swaps. The Spurs are reportedly fielding offers for Murray and have told multiple interested teams that it would take a steep offer for the 25-year-old All-Star. Trade talks between the Hawks and Spurs about a Murray-Collins swap have stretched back to the February trade deadline, according to Bleacher Report — which stated Atlanta is looking to add a dynamic ball-handler and defensive partner alongside Trae Young in the Hawks’ backcourt. Additionally, NBA execs reportedly believe the Spurs are open to an extended rebuild. Murray, among other veterans, has become the subject of trade buzz ahead of the 2022 NBA Draft on Thursday night. On Tuesday, Murray had fans on edge when he shared a cryptic tweet that included a bunch of eyeball emojis. Murray earned his first All-Star nod last season and averaged 21.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 9.2 assists per game. His current four-year, $64 million deal is set to expire in 2024, and Murray is reportedly expected to push for a maximum contract.
