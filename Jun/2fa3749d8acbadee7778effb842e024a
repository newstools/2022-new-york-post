That is one way to score more hole-in-ones. The seller of a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom house in Phoenix has transformed the property’s interior into a golf course — and it can be yours for $1,022,900. Spanning over 4,000 square feet, the desert home was last sold back in 2015 for $475,000. Located in the Point at South Mountain community, the home itself is bordered by the Arizona Grand Golf Course. So, there is plenty of golf to go around if you are an avid fan of the sport. “Enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of South Mountain from your private upstairs balcony while overlooking the 10th fairway of AZ Grand Resort,” the listing hypes. Newly installed features include the nine-hole putting green, which the listing states can be removed “if desired.” It also has a newly resurfaced pool, with new kitchen appliances. Interior features include vaulted ceilings, a spiral staircase and an expansive primary suite with a soaking tub, a walk-in closet, a two-sided wood-burning fireplace and an en suite living room/office. “Open skies and green spaces as far as the eye can see,” the listing adds. Shortly after hitting the market over a week ago, the home, which was built in 1994, has received wide attention on social media for the owners’ creative idea. “Missed opportunity to price this at 1 point ‘Fore’ million,” one person commented under the famed Zillow Gone Wild Instagram account, where the home has racked up tens of thousands of reactions. “Tell me you’re a bachelor without telling me you’re a bachelor,” one Insta wit quipped. “This just screams ‘Karen left me and took the kids, and I didn’t know what to do with all of this space….’ Furniture, Rand, it’s called furniture!” another chimed in. “What chu doin today??? “I dunno just putting around the house,” another individual joked. Benjamin Funke with HomeSmart holds the listing.
