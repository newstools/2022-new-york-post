Mike Trout’s bat is dangerous for opponents, but not umpires. But that changed on Tuesday night Plate umpire Nate Tomlinson was struck in the face by the broken end of Trout’s bat in the top of the ninth of the Dodgers’ 2-0 win over the Angels in the Freeway Series opener for both teams. Tomlinson went down on his knees after the shard of the bat found its way between the bars of his mask. A stunned Trout saw what happened and reluctantly ran to first base for a single. The game was delayed as blood trickled down Tomlinson’s face before he walked off the field. Second base ump Laz Diaz took over behind the plate. “Never seen that in the mask,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “That was really scary.” Shohei Ohtani followed Trout’s single with a double and pinch hitter Matt Duffy walked to load the bases with one out, but Jared Walsh and Max Stassi struck out swinging to end the threat. Tony Gonsolin threw 6¹/₃ scoreless innings, and Mookie Betts hit his 17th home run to propel the Dodgers (38-23) to victory. — AP
