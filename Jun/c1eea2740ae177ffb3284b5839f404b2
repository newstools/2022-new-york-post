Oh my Cod! A Georgian-style manor in Massachusetts that last sold in the 1940s has listed for the first time since in the tony Cape Cod town of North Chatham. “The magnitude of the views from this property is hard to articulate,” Brian Dougherty, who reps the listing with fellow Compass agent Nick Robert, told The Post of the 7,200-square-foot seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom spread, which asks $16.5 million. “One has to stand on the grand lawn and take in how expansive and magical it all is.” The New England retreat, named High Scatteree, comes with its own deep-water dock, a beach and a boathouse (“rare in these parts,” Dougherty noted), a clay tennis court, a private arboretum and a two-bedroom guest house overlooking a seaside rose garden. Located up a winding drive and behind tall hedges on the shore of Pleasant Bay, the waterfront estate is set on slightly more than 2 acres of “lush lawns and gardens” dotted by pathways to the court, guest house, arboretum and, along the almost 500 feet of private shoreline, the boathouse and dock. The main house was built 83 years ago and this is its first time on the public market. “There have been only two owners since the home was built in 1939, and the current owners acquired it from the original family in a private sale,” Dougherty told Mansion Global, adding that the $16.5 million asking price is a record in the area, one of the most desirable in its corner at the edge of Eastern Massachusetts, according to Dougherty. “It’s in the most coveted and quiet part of this area, which is already sought-after. This rare setting offers privacy, which is at a premium right now, along with unbelievable vantage points,” he said. Highlights of the main property include the fact that all of its bedrooms have ensuite baths, the water is seen through the front door, and there are plenty more water views visible through the first-floor “Shore Room,” an early 2000s addition, Mansion Global reported.
