A person who helped authorities find runaway jail boss Vicky White and her lover inmate Casey White collected a $5,000 reward from the state of Alabama Wednesday. The state’s finance department issued the reward to a person who “provided valuable assistance to law enforcement in securing the apprehension and arrest of Casey White,” Gov. Kay Ivey’s office said. The recipient has chosen to remain anonymous and officials did not detail how that tipster helped authorities track down Vicky White, 56, and Casey White, 38, during the 11-day manhunt. “Thanks to the good information from this citizen and the diligent work from law enforcement in Alabama all the way to Indiana, we were able to put the bad guy behind bars where he belongs. I look forward to justice being served,” Ivey said in a statement. James Stinson, the manager of the Weinbach Car Wash, who spotted the abandoned truck that the two were driving, did not receive the reward, he told WEHT. The jailer and inmate couple disappeared from the Lauderdale County Detention Facility on April 29. They were finally found May 9 in Evansville, Indiana, more than 450 miles from the prison. Vicky White committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a brief chase and Casey White was taken into custody. With Post Wires
