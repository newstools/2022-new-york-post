Not trying to boast – but we rate ourselves pretty highly when it comes to brain teasers and riddles. So when we first saw this holey t-shirt puzzle, we thought we had it figured out in seconds. But trust us, this brainteaser isn’t quite as simple as it seems. The illustration – developed by Bright Side – challenges players to spot how many holes there are in this white t-shirt. And the creators claim only 17 percent of people will answer it correctly. So how well will you do? At first glance, it looks like there are just two holes in the top – right? Well in order for players to be able to see straight through the t-shirt, that means there must be two corresponding holes on the back too – which takes the total to four. However, that’s not it – as the riddle also wants you to take into account the holes for arms and head. Once you’ve added all those up, you’re left with seven. But before you log that as your final answer, don’t forget the hole at the very bottom which allows you to put the top on in the first place. In total, that takes it up to eight holes – which is six more than we originally thought. Whoops. For more brainteasers, if you can find the hidden second animal in this picture, you’re in the top 1% – and there are clues to help. And what you see first in this optical illusion will reveal if you feel trapped in your life. This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
