A woman has shared how she got revenge after being catcalled in the street. Now social media users are responding with their own tips for gaining back power in similar situations. One woman named Katy Comer, who goes by @katycomer on TikTok, said she was tired of being catcalled and doing nothing about it. This time, she decided to speak up with a hilarious comeback — and the responses to her video are even better. “Guys I just did it,” she said while walking down the street smiling. “There were three guys that were just sitting on a stoop, and they were like, ‘Mmm gorgeous girl, gorgeous.’ “And I just calmly said, ‘Oh I’m sorry, I don’t have any change.’” She did this to make them think she viewed them as beggars. “The look on their face! Thank you to whoever started this because that is just—that is the money shot right there,” she said, referring to the shocked look on the catcallers’ faces. Viewers in the comments section said they’ve had their own fair share of fun when clapping back at gross men on the streets: “A man catcalled me in a convenience store this afternoon and I told him I was a nun and I’d pray for him. His face!” one person wrote. “I would often get told, ‘Smile beautiful,’ and I’d respond, ‘Say something funny!’ ” a second shared. “Or give them this sign,” a woman wrote alongside a hand emoji that insinuates a small size. “I like to add a ‘God bless you,’ as I walk away,” chimed another.
