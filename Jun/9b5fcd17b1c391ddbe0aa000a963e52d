A seventh member of the Haitian delegation for the 2022 Special Olympics USA Games has mysteriously disappeared while visiting central Florida for the athletic competitions, authorities say. The Osceola County Sheriff’s Office said Louis Jacques Wilguens, 25, was last seen getting off a bus at the All-Star Sports Resort in Lake Buena Vista near Orlando around 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Wilguens was supposed to fly back to Haiti on Sunday, but he never made it onto his flight. Wilguens was last seen wearing red sandals, blue jeans and a white Special Olympics shirt with “Haiti” written on it. The sheriff’s office urged members of the public who encounter Wilguens “to check his well being” and contact authorities. No foul play is suspected in any of the cases. Wilguens was listed as having played soccer during the 2019 Special Olympics, although it is unclear if he competed in any of this year’s events. Only one of the other missing men is a Special Olympics athlete, organizers said. In addition to Wilguens, six other members of the Haitian delegation vanished in Florida last Monday. The sheriff’s office identified the missing as Oriol Jean, 18, Anderson Petit-Frère, 18, Peter Mianovich Berlus, 19, Nicholson Fontilus, 20, Steevenson Jacquet, 24, and Antione Joseph Mithon, 34. The six Haitian nationals were involved with a soccer team. They were last seen near the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, where some of the competitions are being held. All six turned in their hotel room keys and left their luggage in their rooms before they went missing. It wasn’t clear if Wilquens did the same before vanishing. “The reason for their departure from the Games is currently unknown,” Special Olympics USA Games organizers said in a statement to NBC News. “The well-being of these delegates is our foremost concern.” The week-long competition, which brought together more than 5,500 athletes and coaches from the US and Caribbean nations, wrapped up Sunday.
