A 13-year-old boy driving a stolen car was shot dead by a Texas police officer after cops say the teen rammed a patrol vehicle during a chase Friday. The San Antonio Police Department said officers were responding to reports of shots fired in the 5100 block of War Cloud Street around 1:30 a.m. when they spotted a red car with three teenagers inside. When the 13-year-old driver of the vehicle, which police said had been reported as stolen, saw cops, he backed up and T-boned a marked San Antonio police cruiser, according to the station KSAT. According to the agency, one of the officers fired a single shot at the stolen car, striking the 13-year-old driver once in the abdomen. The boy was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to University Hospital, where he later died of his injuries. He has yet to be identified. The two other occupants of the stolen vehicle were unharmed. It’s unclear at this time if they would face any criminal charges. Police have not named the officer who fired the fatal shot. He will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting.
