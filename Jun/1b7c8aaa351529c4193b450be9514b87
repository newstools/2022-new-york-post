There never seems to be a dull moment when it comes to Aaron Rodgers. The Packers quarterback, 38, has recently been linked by website SideAction to a new gal pal named “Blu,” two months after his broken engagement to actress Shailene Woodley. Though reports identified Rodgers’ rumored lady love as a witch by the name of “Blu of Earth,” she shot down those allegations Thursday in a series of Instagram Stories, posting, “Ps… My name is Blu. Not Blu of Earth,” and, “I do not identify as a witch. Y’all are hilarious.” Blu did not deny the romance rumors involving her and Rodgers, however. The quarterback — who does follow Blu on Instagram — has yet to address the latest buzz as of Friday morning. Earlier this week, an image surfaced of Rodgers posing next to Blu, who allegedly changed her birth name from Charlotte Brereton, a source told SideAction. Blu is the founder of Florescence, a “modern mystery school for women to reclaim the magical, radically authentic, wise, wild, unapologetic you,” according to her Instagram page. She also hosts a podcast called “DeJá Blu,” which is described as “a clean reservoir of consciousness from which souls thirsty for purity, relief and love can drink.” Prior to her apparent romance with Rodgers, Blu split from her boyfriend of nearly three years in May, according to a post he shared, explaining that the breakup was amicable.
