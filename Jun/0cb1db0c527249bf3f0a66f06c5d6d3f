Rory McIlroy may be off to a hot start at this year’s US Open, but his play isn’t the only thing that has Twitter talking. The 33-year-old golfer paired his floral Nike shirt with beige slacks and multi-colored shoes for Thursday’s opening round in Brookline, Mass., which has divided folks on the social media platform. “Looks like 90’s wallpaper,” one user wrote, while another remarked, “Shoulda left it on grandma’s couch.” One user also commented, “Has anyone discussed Rory’s pants yet? And by Rory’s pants I mean also his golf shirt. He needs an intervention.” Elsewhere, some fans expressed they wanted to put a rush order in for McIlroy’s top. “Rory is wearing the nicest golf shirt of all time today. I need it,” a user stated, with another responding, “@McIlroyRory ‘s shirt today .” McIlroy, who sported a pink shirt, blue pants and white shoes for his RBC Canadian Open win last week, is near the top of the leaderboard during Thursday’s first round.
