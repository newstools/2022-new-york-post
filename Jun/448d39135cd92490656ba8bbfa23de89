Two off-duty NYPD cops had their service firearms swiped from their luggage on a plane, according to police sources. The two officers from the 44th Precinct were flying from JFK airport to Atlanta on a JetBlue flight Thursday, sources said. The pair had their firearms, two 9mm handguns, packed securely with their luggage per U.S. Customs and TSA regulations. They boarded the plane which was scheduled to leave around 2 p.m, according to sources. The flight was delayed and finally arrived in Atlanta at 8 p.m., sources said. When the cops went to claim their luggage from the caddy, they searched through their bags and discovered the guns were missing, according to sources. Atlanta police were notified of the incident and are currently investigating.
