The Sanderson sisters have risen from their ashes and are back to cause chaos in the town of Salem. “Hocus Pocus” first spooked viewers almost 30 years ago and the long-awaited sequel has finally come. Disney+ dropped a teaser for “Hocus Pocus 2” on Tuesday and stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy are back as Winifred, Sarah and Mary Sanderson. The official synopsis of the sequel reads: “It’s been 29 years since someone lit the Black Flame Candle and resurrected the 17th-century sisters, and they are looking for revenge. Now it is up to three high-school students to stop the ravenous witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on Salem before dawn on All Hallow’s Eve.” The one-minute trailer starts with two teens lighting the Black Flame Candle, with the sisters being resurrected by the fire. “Lock up your children. Yes, Salem, we’re back!” Midler-as-Winifred explains once they arrive back on Earth. “Some legends never die,” text splashes across the teaser, as whispers of magical phrases and spells can be heard throughout the clip. By the end of the video, the witchy sisters were approached by a man who asks them: “I bet you’re looking for the stage.” To witch Winifred simply responds back, “Always.” Doug Jones is also returning to the role of Billy Butcherson and newcomers include Sam Richardson, Hannah Waddingham, Whitney Peak, Belissa Escobedo, Lilia Buckingham, Froyan Gutierrez and Tony Hale. The original movie has been a Halloween staple since it hit theaters in 1993. The spooky cult classic reemerges every scary season and is still beloved by fans. “Hocus Pocus 2” premieres Sept. 30 on Disney+.
