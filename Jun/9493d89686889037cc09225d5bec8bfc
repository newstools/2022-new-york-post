The Jets signed fourth-round pick Micheal Clemons on Thursday. Clemons’ rookie contract is for four years and pays him $4.4 million. The Jets drafted Clemons, a defensive end, out of Texas A&M. He was the seventh and final draft pick for the Jets. He had seven sacks last year for the Aggies. The Jets have only two remaining draft picks who are unsigned – second-round running back Breece Hall and fourth-round offensive tackle Max Mitchell.
