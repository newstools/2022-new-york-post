Former Jets lineman Laurent Duvernay-Tardif is heading back to medicine. Duvernay-Tardif will step away from NFL free agency for now and take up a residency program at a Montreal-area hospital next month, he told the Canadian Press. Duvernay-Tardif will finish his requirements to become a physician before considering a potential return to football in September when the season is beginning. “I’m going to prioritize medicine… and we’ll see in September if there’s a fit,” Duvernay-Tardif said. “After eight years in the NFL, and I don’t want to sound pretentious by saying this, but I think I’ve earned the right to do what’s best for me and not just for football and kind of bet on myself a little bit.” Duvernay-Tardif was traded from the Chiefs to the Jets in early November for tight end Dan Brown. “I’m really comfortable with the risk, and I’m pretty confident there’s going to be an offer on the table in September,” Duvernay-Tardif said. “If I want it, and if I want it, I’ll take it. If medicine is going well and I feel like I’ve got to be out there in front of 80,000 people to play the sport I love, well, I’ll go but I think I want it to be more on my terms.” This isn’t Duvernay-Tardif’s first leave from the NFL. The former Chief opted out of the 2020 NFL season to assist in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Duvernay-Tardif has already completed his master’s in surgery and doctorate in medicine from the McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal.
