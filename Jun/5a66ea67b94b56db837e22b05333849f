A Brooklyn man was arrested Thursday in connection with the March shooting of a 7-year-old girl in Coney Island. Jaden Baskerville, 21, faces charges of attempted murder, assault and criminal use of a firearm in connection with the March 21 broad daylight attack, according to the NYPD. Baskerville allegedly opened fire from a black sedan in front of 2920 Surf Ave. that afternoon, grazing the young victim as she stood outside a deli with her mother. The young girl suffered a wound to her abdomen and was treated at NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn. The child did not appear to be the gunman’s intended target, police said at the time.
