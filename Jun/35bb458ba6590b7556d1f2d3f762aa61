The Dodgers thus far have maintained their NL West lead despite some key injuries, but it’s going to get more difficult if the injuries continue to mount like this. They’ve now lost top setup man Daniel Hudson for the season, as the right-hander suffered a season-ending torn ACL in Friday’s win over the Braves. “Obviously, it’s a big loss,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters. Hudson, 35, had a “clean tear” of his left ACL, Roberts said, and will be out approximately six to nine months. In 25 appearances this season, Hudson had a 2.22 ERA with 30 strikeouts in 24 1/3 innings while recording five saves. Hudson’s injury is another blow to a bullpen that lost Blake Treinen to a shoulder injury in April. Treinen resumed playing catch earlier this month. Ex-Yankee Tommy Kahnle is also on the Dodgers’ 60-day injured list with a forearm injury. The Dodgers lost ace Walker Buehler two weeks ago because of a flexor strain in his right elbow. At the time he was shut down for six to eight weeks. Last week outfielder Mookie Betts went on the injured list with a ribs injury after an outfield collision with Cody Bellinger. Left-hander Andrew Heaney went right back on the injured list Friday with a shoulder injury after returning from the IL earlier in the week for one start. — With AP
