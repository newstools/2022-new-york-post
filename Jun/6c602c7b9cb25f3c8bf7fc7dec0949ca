Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen just can’t control himself. On Wednesday, Bills tight end Dawson Knox shared that Allen has a new “deez nuts” joke daily. “Every day is a new ‘deez nuts’ joke,” the tight end said with a smile. “You can never be comfortable around him because anytime he comes up and asks you a question, you just have to walk away.” The veterans, according to Knox, leave it to the rookies to learn the lesson themselves. “They have no idea,” Knox said. “They’re just like, ‘Oh, what, what is it?’ Anybody new in the locker room and then it spreads to the whole team and by the end of the day they’re all cracking the same joke. “That’s a little peek into his personality.” Allen, who has developed into one of the leagues elite quarterbacks, has probably earned the privilege of messing with his teammates and rookies. The Wyoming product has racked up 14,114 yards and 103 touchdowns to only 46 interceptions in four seasons with the Bills. Josh Allen will hope to terrorize opponents’ defenses he way he has terrorized his rookies in the coming NFL season.
