Betting against the Yankees? Against Gerrit Cole? Better chance Alec Baldwin wears that Donald Trump getup on SNL again. That said, getting the Astros, the second best team (a distant second) in the American League, at +125 is an enticing play. A perennial Cy Young candidate, Cole (6-1, 3.14) has lost once in 14 starts and has allowed one run over his last 13 ¹/₃ innings.  The Astros hand the ball to Cristian Javier (4-3, 3.07). No Cy numbers for Javier, but no sigh numbers either. He’s given up three runs over his last 11 innings to the Rangers and White Sox. The Yanks are not the Strangers or the Chisox, but we will back Javier and the road dog Astros for 10 units. Rafael Devers and Christian Arroyo homered, Nick Pivetta pitched seven strong and the Red Sox doubled up the Guardians 6-3. Winner. Up +1,305 carltonfisks.
