It sure seems like Tom Brady already misses Rob Gronkowski. Gronkowski, 33, announced his second retirement from the NFL on Tuesday morning. But, Drew Rosenhaus — Gronkowski’s agent — told ESPN that the tight end could still come out of retirement “if Tom Brady calls him during the season.” In response, Brady tweeted a popular meme of former congressional candidate Martin Baker making a phone call. Gronkowski spent all of his 11 NFL seasons playing alongside Brady, including stints with New England and Tampa Bay. He even unretired in April of 2020 to reunite with Brady as a Buccaneer and later win another Super Bowl. Earlier on Tuesday, Brady took to Instagram to express appreciation for the five-time Pro Bowler. “Teammate, friend, brother, just a few of the words that come to mind when I think of Gronk,” Brady wrote. “Nobody has ever embodied the idea of ‘leaving it all out on the field’ like Rob has throughout his entire career. Every single snap, I knew that no matter how many people you put in front of him, he was going to get to his spot. “Even more important is the person he was off the field. Focused when he had to be, and fun the rest of the time. Having Gronk in your locker room was every NFL player’s dream. I’m proud of all that we’ve accomplished together, and even more excited for all you have ahead of you.” And, just maybe, that includes another hurrah in Tampa Bay with Brady.
