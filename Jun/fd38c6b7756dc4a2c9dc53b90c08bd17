Rocker Bon Jovi has sold his West Village home for $22 million, according to property records. The New Jersey born rock royal listed his four-bedroom, 3½-bath Greenwich Lane pad, at 155 W. 11th St., for $22 million last February. It went into contract six days later. The buyer, we hear, is Michael Ovitz, the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency who was also president of the Walt Disney Co., who did not return calls at press time. The spacious 3,951-square-foot home comes with its own elevator landing that opens to a gallery with “art walls.” There’s also a natural toned chef’s kitchen with a balcony and a 40-foot-long living room, plus oak floors. The main corner bedroom suite features floor-to-ceiling windows, a walk-in closet and a windowed marble bathroom. Bon Jovi bought the 14th-floor unit for $18.94 million in 2017. Building amenities include a concierge, a gym with a 75-foot pool, a whirlpool, steam rooms, treatment rooms and a golf simulator. There’s also a garden, reflecting pool, residents lounge, a dining room with a chef’s kitchen, a screening room, playroom, and bike and cold storage. During the pandemic, Bon Jovi sold his Palm Beach mansion for $20 million and bought a bigger oceanfront estate for $43 million. He also owns property in the Hamptons. The listing brokers are Leonard Steinberg, Herve Senequier, Amy Mendizabal, Calli Sarkesh, and Niklas Hackstein, of Compass.
