A boss has been blasted for introducing an extreme office rule that punishes staff for being one minute late. A poster explaining the draconian rules has gone viral after a disgruntled employee posted it on social media. He captioned the snap:  “Shout out the worst place I ever worked (minimum wage, of course).” The sign reads: “New office rule: For every minute you are late for work, you will be required to work for 10 minutes after 6 pm. “For example, if you arrive at 10:02, you will have to stay an extra 20 minutes until 6:20pm. Thanks.” Thousands of people rushed to the comments to give their two cents on the harsh rule. One person wrote: “That seems really dumb and highly illegal.” Another fumed: “I’d tell them to f*** off.” While a third said: “Do you want to lose employees? Because that’s how you lose employees.” However, some people agreed with the boss – saying that lateness should be punished. One person pointed out: “It’s honestly so easy to show up on time though… like. I get to work 10 minutes early.” And another agreed: “How about being on time? Quit your whining.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
