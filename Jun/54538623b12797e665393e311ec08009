A convicted Washington state killer voluntarily surrendered to police after he was mistakenly sprung from prison with 21 years left on his sentence last week. A Pierce County court moved to resentence Jeremey Bennett for the 2013 murder of Lawrence Howse last Friday, on account of his young age during the crime, according to KOMO-TV. The Department of Corrections misinterpreted Bennett’s resentencing order last week, and released him, county officials told the outlet. The DOC reportedly maintained they did not make a mistake because his original sentence was labeled “vacated” on the order. Amid the confusion, Bennett told his jailers they were wrong to release him and later turned himself in to police, according to the article. Bennett was reportedly 17 when he committed the fatal parking garage robbery. He was tried as an adult and pleaded guilty in 2015, receiving a 28-year sentence.
