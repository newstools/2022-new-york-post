Famed Indian singer KK died at the age of 53. The beloved hitmaker, whose full name was Krishnakumar Kunnath, died in Kolkata, India on Tuesday after collapsing hours after his concert, Times of India reports. KK was in the city for a two-day run of gigs and began to feel ill during Tuesday night’s performance in front of a thousand concertgoers. His set went on for about an hour, after which he reportedly collapsed in his hotel room, local news outlets reported. The singer — who boasted nearly 300,000 followers on Instagram — was then rushed to the hospital but was unable to be saved by medics. According to the outlet, KK ultimately suffered a heart attack. The singer was known for his versatility on stage. He famously recorded and performed songs in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, and Bengali — which contributed to his ever-growing fanbase. After news of his tragic death came to light, India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, paid a touching tribute on Twitter. “Saddened by the untimely demise of noted singer Krishnakumar Kunnath, popularly known as KK,” he tweeted. “His songs reflected a wide range of emotions as struck a chord with people of all age groups. We will always remember him through his songs. “Condolences to his family and fans. Om Shanti.” KK’s manager, Shubham Bhatt, rushed to Instagram to share a picture with KK and other members of his team, writing, “The most unforgettable and best years of my life. Speechless.” KK put his name on the map after the release of his first solo album, “Pal,” in 1999. He then landed his first breakthrough role in Bollywood with the track, “Tadap Tadap Ke” from the hit 1999 film, “Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.” His other popular hits include, “Tune Maari Entriyaan,” and “Sach Keh Raha Hai” from the movie “Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein.” KK leaves behind his wife and their two children, who are due to fly to Kolkata on Wednesday, according to Indian Express.
