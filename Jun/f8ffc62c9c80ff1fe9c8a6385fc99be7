“Obi-Wan Kenobi” actress Vivien Lyra Blair is bringing the full force of Princess Leia for another good cause. The 9-year-old actress — who captured the hearts of “Star Wars” fans with her portrayal of a young Princess Leia in the new Disney+ series — is helping shine a light on Save the Chimps, a nonprofit refuge with 221 chimps rescued from labs and the entertainment industry. “Princess Leia wants to defend all creatures in the galaxy, and so do I,” said Blair in a video timed to her birthday this Saturday — a date she has in common with one of the residents of the 12-island facility. “On June 4, I turn 10 years old — and I share that birthday with Kay the chimp. She was rescued from a lab in New Mexico when she was only just a baby, and now she lives at Save the Chimps, a sanctuary in Florida,” she said. Blair, who was also a PETA spokesperson in 2019, explained that Kay and her “best friend,” Luke — a chimp named for the “Star Wars” character Luke Skywalker, originally played by Mark Hamill — share similarities to the interests of the young actress and her own friends. “Kay and I have a lot in common: We both like playing games, collecting stuffed animals, doing somersaults and eating bananas,” she shared in the charming minute-long clip. “Although, unlike Kay, I don’t eat the peel,” she cheekily added. Blair, who already boasts an Instagram account with more than 218,000 followers, is remembered by many for previously playing Sandra Bullock’s daughter in the Netflix thriller “Bird Box.” Episodes 1, 2 and 3 of “Obi-Wan Kenobi” are available to stream on Disney+, with new episodes dropping every Wednesday.
