MIAMI – Of all the records the Mets could potentially set this season, getting hit by the most pitches in modern baseball history is one they would like to avoid. First, to set the record straight: The Reds were hit by 105 pitches last season, establishing a National League and modern record. The all-time mark was set by the 1898 Orioles, who were plunked an astounding 160 times. This year’s Mets lead the major leagues with 51 hit-by-pitches, putting them slightly ahead of the Reds’ pace from last year. “That’s not good,” Francisco Lindor said. “I hope we don’t break that record. I don’t want to be on that page.”
