There was a surprising discovery Monday at the former home of a late 98-year-old Brooklyn woman — two boxes of grenades, cops said. The 10 inert training grenades were found around 9:15 a.m. as someone cleaned out the basement of the house on 48th Street near Third Avenue in Sunset Park, according to cops and police sources. The NYPD’s Bomb Squad was called to the home and found the grenades to be inert, the sources said. Police did not provide any information on the deceased resident, but records show a 98-year-old woman who lived in the home died in March 2021.
