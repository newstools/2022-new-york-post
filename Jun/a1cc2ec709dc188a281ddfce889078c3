Nancy Pelosi’s spokesperson on Monday accused the media of misrepresenting a video of the House Speaker “pushing” a GOP congresswoman’s young daughter aside — insisting the top Democrat was merely trying to make sure the little girl “wouldn’t be hidden.” Rep. Mayra Flores, of Texas, leveled the accusation at Pelosi late Sunday after the footage, which was taken at the congresswoman’s swearing-in ceremony last week, was shared on social media by conservative commentators. “It’s sad to see ‘news outlets’ that know better misrepresent the Speaker’s effort to ensure Rep. Flores’ daughters wouldn’t be hidden behind her in all of the photos of such an important moment for their family,” Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter. The spokesperson then doubled down and shared additional footage that he said showed Pelosi “graciously greeting Rep. Flores’ children and telling them about the room they are in.” Flores had retweeted the footage Sunday night, writing “No child should be pushed to the side for a photo op. PERIOD!!” “I am so proud of my strong, beautiful daughter for not allowing this to faze her,” Flores added of the photo op. “She continued to smile and pose for the picture like a Queen.” The video in question showed Pelosi standing alongside Flores’ daughter as the Speaker waved over the family’s pastor for a photo during the swearing in ceremony. Pelosi could be seen glancing down at the girl and extending her elbow just as the child scooched over. While it isn’t clear from the footage if Pelosi’s elbow makes contact with the girl, a number of conservative commentators accused the Speaker of elbowing Flores’ daughter. “I love this princess stood her ground, while Nancy showed her true colors,” actor James Woods tweeted. TV show host Benny Johnson tweeted, “Nancy Pelosi ELBOWS the little daughter of new GOP Congresswoman Mayra Flores — what a witch.”
