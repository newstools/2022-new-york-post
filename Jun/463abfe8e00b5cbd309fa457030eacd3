Amy Schumer is moonstruck! The actor and comedian, who was pretty in yellow at the LA premiere of the second season of “Only Murders in the Building,” has been touring multiple Brooklyn Heights townhouses and, we hear, is in contract to buy 19 Cranberry St. That’s where “Moonstruck” — the Oscar-winning 1987 film staring Cher and Nicolas Cage — was filmed. The deal, however, has not yet closed. The 19th-century, 26-foot-wide home first hit the market for $12.85 million in February and was last asking $11 million. The sellers bought it for $3.85 million in 2007. Built in 1829, the five-bedroom home is 5,568 square feet. Listing brokers Karen and Kyle Talbott of Corcoran declined to comment. The news comes as Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, have listed their Upper West Side penthouse at 190 Riverside Drive for $15 million. That five-bedroom home, a 4,500-square-foot penthouse, with a 3,000-square-foot outdoor space over two levels, opens to a key-locked elevator and sits at the top of a landmarked Beaux-Arts building. It comes with glass walls that open and extend to surround a wrap terrace for an LA-style “indoors/outdoors” living space in the heart of the Upper West Side. The building dates to 1908. Schumer bought the full-floor modern spread for $12.14 million in 2016. The home boasts panoramic views of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge and the New York City skyline. The home features a custom anthracite stone-and-gas fireplace and a glass atrium with a wrought-iron staircase that leads to a second terrace. There’s also a chef’s kitchen with a breakfast bar, island and wine fridge, and a separate bedroom wing. Adam Modlin, of the Modlin Group, has the listing.
