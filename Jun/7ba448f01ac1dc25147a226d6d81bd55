This is some top-heavy patriotism. A cosmetic surgeon in Moscow created red, white and blue breast implants for those who want to keep their love of Mother Russia close. “Real patriots will be able to choose the model that is closer to their hearts, literally and figuratively,” celebrity plastic surgeon Dobreikin Evgeny Alekseevich said in a video he published on his Instagram account. The “exclusive” silicone sets, which the implant inventor named “Rosgrud,” are available in two designs- one with a red and a blue stripe to represent the Russian flag, the other coated in camouflage, an apparent nod to his country’s invasion of Ukraine. Alekseevich called his works of art “a stylish solution for those who love their Motherland and want something more than just a sticker on a car or a tattoo on their shoulder.”
