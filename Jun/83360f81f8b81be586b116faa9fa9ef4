Nestor Cortes tweeted support before Friday’s game against the Tigers for Jim Kaat after the former Yankees pitcher and broadcaster apologized for referring to Cortes on the air Thursday as “Nestor the Molester.” “Hey everybody, Jim Kaat has spent an entire lifetime in this game we love,” Cortes tweeted. “He reached out to me and apologized for his remark [Thursday] night, but he didn’t need to. We all make mistakes and feel 100% there was no malice intended. I plan on lifting him up with this tweet and I hope others do, too. No sweat here Jim!” The 83-year-old Kaat, who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame this year from the Golden Days Era Committee, also apologized in October after saying teams should try to “get a 40-acre field full of” players who look like White Sox infielder Yoan Moncada.
