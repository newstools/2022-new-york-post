Four people were wounded — including an 8-year-old boy — in a scooter shooting in Brooklyn on Saturday night, police said. Two men riding on a scooter pulled up around 11:30 p.m. to a large gathering of people in front of the Stuyvesant Gardens Houses on Quincy Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant and opened fire into the crowd, cops said. An 8-year-old boy received a graze wound in the leg. A 27-year-old male, a 35-year-old female and a 46-year-old female were also each shot in the legs. All four victims were transported to Kings County Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The suspects fled on a green and white scooter in an unknown direction, according to police and sources. Six shell casings and two live rounds were recovered at the scene, sources said. No arrests have been made at this time as police continued to canvas the area early Sunday morning.
