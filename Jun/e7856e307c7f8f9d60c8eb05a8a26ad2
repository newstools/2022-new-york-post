Two men exchanged gunfire in a wild caught-on-video Queens shootout this week — and cops are still looking to track down one of the suspects. Footage released early Wednesday shows the suspects — one identified as Tenzin Norgyal, 28 — recklessly shooting at each other at the busy corner of 65th Street and Broadway in Sunnyside Gardens around 3:20 p.m. Tuesday. Norgyal was struck in the right shoulder during the melee and taken by private means to Elmhurst Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. Norgyal, a reputed member of the TNT gang, was also arrested and charged with attempted murder, cops said. The other man, shown wearing a red and white short-sleeved shirt, took off in a black Audi four-door sedan with a paper license plate, heading north on 64th Street, police said. Cops are still looking to track down that suspect — who they say is about 5 feet 6 and 150 pounds, with a medium build, medium complexion and short black hair. The two men know each other, but the shootout seemed to stem from a chance encounter, cops said. Words were exchanged before the clash escalated into violence, police said. Despite Norgyal’s gang affiliation, cops could not confirm whether the shooting was gang-related.
