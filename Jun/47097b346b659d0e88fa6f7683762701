This apparently well-off couple pissed a lot of people off. The Luxe Travel Couple, who run a travel tip page on TikTok, went viral for their tone-deaf approach to flying on private jets. In a vlog they posted this week, which now has 1.2 million views, the female passenger states, “Here’s what it’s like to travel private instead of First.” She goes on to film the amenities, such as private lounge access, complimentary snacks and escort and car services that passengers are pampered with when they fly on private jets. The wealthy duo, who were traveling to Marrakech, Morocco, from the UK, sparked backlash from fellow TikTok users. “Can’t afford either of these, but thanks for the visual that I will never see in person… Good for hoping and wishing,” one commented. “Thanks for reminding us how poor we are,” another quipped. “‘Complementary,’ you mean included in the cost?” someone else added. Their page’s profile description boasts, “just a couple of their travels,” and documents lavish excursions to places like Dubai and the Maldives where they relax in pricey spas and villas.
