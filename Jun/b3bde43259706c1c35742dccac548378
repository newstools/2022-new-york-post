A historic Tudor-style townhouse known as the “Castle in the Village” has hit the market for $19.5 million. It’s the first time the turn of the century West Village townhouse has been on the market in more than four decades. The seller is architect Carl Pucci, who is now an empty nester. He bought it in 1982 for an undisclosed price. The couple are moving to a home upstate, a source says. The 26-foot-wide, three-story townhouse, at 33 Perry St., was once a private horse stable until it was bought by St John’s in the Village Episcopal Church around the corner on Waverly Place in the 1920s. The church planned to create an artists’ colony with a communal garden that it would share, and bought up some townhouses, including 33 Perry St. But the stock market crash of October 1929 dashed the dream. By the 1950s, there were some writers in the townhouses, like Mary Cantwell, who wrote “Manhattan, When I Was Young,” and lived at 224 W. 11th St. The homes, including 33 Perry, were converted into four apartments. One of the residents, fashion executive Tom Fallon, threw famed parties in his unit and the back garden. He once told the Times that he could cram “hundreds” into the apartment, which included a “baronial” fireplace and leaded glass window overlooking the “magical garden.” Guests included his then-boss, designer Bill Blass, and Blass’s “society” friends. By 1982, Pucci bought the building and it became home to his family, including children and step-children. The 6,501-square-foot home features ten to 14-foot high ceilings on each floor, plus 2,167 square feet of cellar space and a full rooftop garden. It is currently configured as a six-bedroom, 6½-bath home. The main floor used to have a ballroom that is now used as an office. The home is currently divided into separate units but can be converted back to single-family mansion status. The listing brokers are Meris and Kenny Blumstein of the Corcoran Group.
