Miami Heat star Tyler Herro and girlfriend Katya Elise Henry appear to be going strong just one week after Henry shared cryptic Instagram posts about cheating. Herro took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a birthday tribute “to the most beautiful girl in the world” in honor of Henry’s 28th birthday. “Words can’t describe how much I appreciate you,” Herro wrote alongside photos of the couple and their daughter Zya, who turned 9 months old on Tuesday. “Ain’t no tellin where we’d be at without you. You’ve been my rock holding it down for 2 years, I can’t wait to see what life has in store for us. Enjoy. Smile. More life to 28 biggggg babbyyyy.” Herro’s post comes days after the longtime couple was rumored to have broken up. Just last week, Henry shared curious messages about cheating on her social media pages and appeared to scrub all traces of Herro, 22. “If you cheat on someone that is willing to do anything for you, you actually cheated yourself out of loyalty,” read one message posted by Henry, according to screenshots. On Tuesday, however, Henry shared a positive message on her Instagram Story that read: “Mija it’s never too late to give yourself a fresh start.” Henry, who is a fitness entrepreneur, also appeared to hint that she and Herro are currently enjoying a tropical vacation with their daughter, as she posted a number of videos online that featured an outdoor pool and shower, as well as a bed covered in birthday decor. Herro, meanwhile, hasn’t shared any posts about the couple as of Wednesday morning. Henry welcomed daughter Zya with Herro last September. The point guard, who won the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award in May, is believed to have started dating Henry in March 2020, when he tweeted, “wyd,” at the fitness model.
