ESPN boxing broadcasters Timothy Bradley and Joe Tessitore issued an on-air apology Saturday night after laughing about a disturbing video of boxer Simiso Buthelezi, who died after falling into a coma following his fight with Siphesihle Mntungwa. Bradley said he didn’t know Buthelezi had died, while Tessitore said he didn’t know the video Bradley was referencing. Bradley, the former light welterweight and welterweight champion, brought up the video of a disoriented Buthelezi throwing punches in the direction of the referee after Tessitore mentioned Alexis Angulo attempted to go to a neutral corner, then Edgar Berlanga’s corner, during Saturday night’s fight at MSG’s Hulu Theater. “I’ve seen worse. There’s a video circulating right now where a guy actually knocked another guy out of the ring. He got back in the ring and the other guy actually started boxing a ghost in the corner,” Bradley said during the fourth round of the Berlanga-Angulo fight, via clips captured by Awful Announcing. Tessitore then laughed before Bradley finished his thought. “I’m serious. He was boxing somebody in the corner when the ref said ‘box.’ I’m telling you,” Bradley said. Bradley apologized at the start of the sixth round. “I want to take the time out right now and apologize for that last statement that I made about that guy that was actually punching someone in the corner. He actually passed away a few days ago. I had no clue that he passed away, and I just want to give my utmost apologies to his family and to his loved ones,” Bradley said. Tessitore said he was “unaware” of the video Bradley brought up before acknowledging Buthelezi’s death. Buthelezi was 24.
