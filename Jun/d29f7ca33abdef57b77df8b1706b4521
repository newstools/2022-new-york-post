A man who had escaped from a New York courtroom after being convicted of attempted murder two weeks ago shot and killed himself during a standoff with police in Orlando Thursday. Michael Green, 36, who also went by the last name Edwards, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at Mosaic at Millenia Apartments, hours after barricading himself inside one of the units, the Albany County District Attorney’s Office wrote in a statement. Green had spent the past two weeks on the run from law enforcement, ever since he took off from an Albany County courthouse in upstate New York before a jury found him guilty of attempted murder and criminal gun possession stemming from a drive-by shooting, reported ClickOrlando. The attempted murder charge carried a sentence of 25 years in prison. Green had been charged with firing a gun in the direction of a house in Colonie, New York, in 2020 where several people, including children, were living. Green had been out on $100,000 bail during the weeklong trial and had been in court each day, until June 10, when he fled before the guilty verdict was read. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest after he ran away from court. It’s unclear how Green made his way to Orlando, located 1,200 miles to the south. Orlando police and U.S. Marshals tried to make contact with Green after he holed himself up in the apartment on Conroy Street Tuesday. SWAT team members and crisis negotiators worked for more than five hours to get the fugitive to peacefully surrender. At 7:30 p.m. officers entered the apartment and found Green dead by suicide.
