A 3-year-old girl and a 31-year-old woman were fighting for their lives Sunday night after their Brooklyn home was engulfed in flames, authorities said. The pair are listed in critical condition after being rescued from the fire that erupted at about 6 p.m. on the first floor of the two-story residence on Kings Highway in Flatlands, according to the FDNY. Firefighters issued an “all-hands” alert and got the blaze under control by 6:37 p.m., according to the department. They rescued the young girl and the woman from inside the building and EMS rushed both to Staten Island University Hospital North in critical condition. Dramatic footage from the scene shows first-responders running with a person on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance as firefighters climb up two outstretched ladders into the upstairs windows of the smoking building. One firefighter was also injured and was treated at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. The FDNY didn’t immediately provide the condition of the smoke-eater.
