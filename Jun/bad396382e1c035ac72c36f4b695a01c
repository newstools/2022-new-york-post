That’s one lucky dog. A lost pooch was found by Hilary Swank while she was filming in Albany Monday — and the actress hand-delivered the animal back to its owner of 15 years in a touching moment that was captured on camera. The happy ending capped off the stressful ordeal for Chelsea Blackwell, who hopped into her car and frantically drove around town after noticing her elder dachshund Blue had gone missing. Blackwell asked anyone and everyone if they might have seen a small brown dog and ended up downtown at a Greyhound bus station where she noticed a lot of commotion, she told the Albany Times Union. There were eight police cars and people with cameras at the station in what turned out to be a film set, she said. Blackwell asked one of the people if anyone had spotted a little dog and to her relief, one said yes. The camera crew told her a celebrity had found her dog and made a call to the “Million Dollar Baby” actress’s reps. About an hour later, a gray car pulled up and Blackwell saw Blue sitting comfortably on Swank’s lap. She said she couldn’t believe it. “I was like, ‘No way,'” Blackwell told the Times Union. “As soon as she got out of the car, I kissed Blue and said, ‘Thank you so much.’ “ She asked for an autograph, but Swank suggested the three of them — Blackwell, herself and little Blue — take a photo together instead, Blackwell said. She posted the photo to Facebook and it soon garnered hundreds of likes and shares. “Id stopped and asked if someone seen a little brown dog? A man walked over to my car and said, yes, this woman picked him up. I said who? He replied, a celebrity,” Blackwell wrote in the post. “He called the person who had him. And they said she’s on her way back.. You’ll never guess who had him?? Hillary [sic] Swank.”
