Sha’Carri Richardson left the athletics world in disbelief after failing to advance in the women’s 100 meter event at the U.S. track and field championships Thursday. Richardson never got her footing in what’s usually one of her strongest events, ultimately finishing fifth in her heat with a time of 11.31. The poor performance was drastically slower than the 10.85 she recorded earlier this month in the 100 at a meet in New York – a time that earned her second overall in the contest. The 22-year-old had no desire to discuss what may have caused the disappointing showing, jogging quickly past a growing group of reporters following the race. The top-three finishers in the finals at the Eugene, Oregon meet will punch their tickets to the World Championships as a member of Team USA. The event, set to take place in the United States for the first time ever, will also be held at Eugene’s Hayward Field. While her dreams of competing in the 100m for Team USA are crushed, Richardson can still make the World Championships by finishing top three in the women’s 200 meters. She finished first in this event earlier this month with a time of 22.38. Richardson quickly became an American fan favorite after bursting onto the scene at the US Olympic trials last year, showcasing her blazing speed and unique personality. Equipped with her signature vibrant hair color, flamboyant track suit and massive fingernail extensions, she ran the 100m in 10.86, good enough for first in her heat. Despite qualifying for the Tokyo games, her spot on the team was removed following a positive cannabis test. Richardson’s poor performance on Thursday looks to be just another obstacle in her professional journey. “Don’t let the media, don’t let people, don’t let a company, try to stop you from shining, because you sunshine,” Richardson told a cheering crowd of young fans at a recent New York meet. “We are the light.”
