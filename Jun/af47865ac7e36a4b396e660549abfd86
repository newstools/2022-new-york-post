Billy Eppler boarded a plane in California. Sandy Alderson did the same in Florida on his 74th birthday. They were converging on Arizona. Lunch was planned in Scottsdale that Monday. This meal, at the True Food Test Kitchen on Nov. 22, would initiate arguably the most transformative week in franchise history. By Sunday night Steve Cohen had blessed the largest per-annum contract in baseball history for Max Scherzer, overshadowing what had come in the days prior.

It strengthened and deepened a lineup, a style of play and a mindset that the Mets wanted to construct.
