Sue Bird followed through on her threat to The Rock and the XFL that her inclusivity brand has exclusive intellectual property. In April, Bird and her wife, Megan Rapinoe, threatened to sue Dwayne Johnson and the spring football league, claiming their branding was similar to the “TOGETHXR” media brand of which Bird is a co-founder. According to TMZ, TOGETHXR filed a suit on Wednesday, claiming the XFL’s logo is “confusingly similar to TOGETHXR’s brand and logo.” The suit, which named the XFL but did not directly name Johnson, places the logos side-by-side to denote the similarities. TOGETHXR’s attorneys say they made “repeated attempts” to reach the XFL over this imbroglio, but that the football league “failed to acknowledge that it has tread on TOGETHXR’s rights.” TOGETHXR is a lifestyle and culture brand cofounded by Bird, USWNT star Alex Morgan and Olympic gold medalists Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim. When this issue first arose in April, Rapinoe weighed in. “Welp. This is awkward,” Rapinoe tweeted, with a screengrab of the XFL’s branding announcement from LinkedIn. “Only thing @TheRock and @XFL2023 are gonna be cookin up is a response to the Cease and Desist and an ENTIRE new brand ID. @togethxr got this on lock boys.” Johnson, who has not yet publicly responded to this issue, led an ownership group that purchased the XFL out of bankruptcy court in 2020. The league is returning in 2023, with a recently announced TV deal with Disney’s ABC and ESPN.
