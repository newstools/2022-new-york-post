Edgar Berlanga didn’t even catch an earful for trying to bite an ear full. Berlanga defeated Alexis Angulo by unanimous decision in a super middleweight bout as the main event on a TopRank card on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden’s Hulu Theater. And he escaped without so much as a warning for a move that left the commentators and other boxers in shock. In a scene reminiscent of when Mike Tyson bit the ear of Evander Holyfield during a 1997 bout, Berlanga bit Angulo’s left shoulder and then tried to bite his left ear as they came together during the seventh of 10 rounds. Angulo immediately cocked his head back, threw his arms in the air and put a glove to his ear to show the referee what happened. “He was throwing elbows. I was about to do a Mike Tyson on him,” Berlanga said afterward. “He kept throwing his elbows, and I didn’t want to get cut.” Whereas Tyson was disqualified for twice going for Holyfied’s ear in one of boxing’s most unforgettable moments, Berglanga, who hails from Brooklyn, was not penalized. The referee actually warned Angulo for punching behind the head. Berlanga was bleeding from the nose early in the fight and from his mouth near the end. “I just got the experience I needed,” Berlanga said. “Once again, my power is still there. I hurt him a couple of times. I didn’t want to fall for any traps or anything. I knew he was a tough guy.” Terrence Crawford, an undefeated welterweight champion, reacted on Twitter: “Lol he tried to bite him,” with three laughing emojis.
