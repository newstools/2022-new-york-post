Sharks are sinking their teeth into beach life near Cape Cod. Massive man-eaters — including great whites — are lurking in the waters near the popular vacation destination, scientists warned after a sighting shuttered a beach in the area this week. “Just know that large sharks are here,” Megan Winton, a researcher for the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy said at a press conference Wednesday. “They’re a constant presence from June to the fall.” Winton urged swimmers to beware after a great white was spotted at Head of the Meadow Beach in Truro Tuesday, prompting officials to close the shoreline for roughly an hour. In the past week, at least 11 sharks have been spotted in the region, according to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy’s Sharktivity app, which tracks confirmed and unconfirmed sightings. The apex predators begin migrating to the coast of Massachusetts as the weather warms — and often swim near coastlines that drop off dramatically into deep waters, biologists said. “Sharks will come close to the shore when they have water depth,” said Greg Skomal, a marine biologist who studies great whites in Massachusetts. Great Whites tend to flock to the section of  Cape Cod that faces the Atlantic Ocean to feast on its thriving seal population, he said. Earlier this month, a great white shark was filmed swimming alongside a vacationing family on a boating trip near Cape Cod — striking fear in the hearts of beach-goers. Vacationers on Wedsday said they planned to stay in shallow waters, according to CBS Boston. “I would probably put my toes in — that’s it,” said Nicole Fach, who was visiting Cape Cod from Cleveland, Ohio.
