So much for President Joe Biden restoring the world’s respect for America: He just got dissed by the president of Mexico, with Brazil’s joining in. Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says he’s skipping this week’s Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles because the tyrants running Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua didn’t get invites, which AMLO calls “lack of respect for nations and their people.” As if restricting invitations to democracies equals imperialism. (Then again, AMLO’s been eroding  Mexico’s democratic checks and balances, perhaps aiming to catch up with the three lefty dictators.) Of course, AMLO quite publicly lost respect for Biden when the US prez reversed course on border control, greatly adding to Mexico’s troubles with migrants heading north. Now Brazil’s righty loon Jair Bolsanairo is threatening to skip the summit. Who’s next, Peru? Winning the world’s respect is plainly a lot tougher than Biden figured, one more sign that he’s a lightweight who doesn’t know it.
