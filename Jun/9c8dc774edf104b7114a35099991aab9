Two cops were hurt when a fleeing driver in Brooklyn struck them during a car stop Thursday evening, police say. The officers were conducting a traffic stop at Empire Boulevard and Flatbush Avenue in Prospect Lefferts Gardens around 6:50 p.m. when the 25-year-old male driver accelerated forward — knocking both cops to the ground before jumping out of his car and running off, authorities said. Additional responding officers arrested the suspect a “short distance” away, cops said. Both officers were taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries and released. Charges were pending against the motorist Friday.
