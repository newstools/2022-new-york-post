A man on a Southwest flight reportedly AirDropped a sexually explicit photo to all passengers on Saturday — leading to police waiting to escort him off the plane upon his arrival. In a now-viral TikTok, user @DaddyStrange333 addressed the man as “Larry,” and he is seen getting reprimanded by the user and a flight attendant for allegedly sharing a graphic photo with all passengers, especially as kids sat behind him. The Post is withholding the full name she references in her TikTok until representatives for Southwest Airlines and the FBI respond to The Post’s request for confirmation. “I saw his iPad had airdrop open, so I knew it was him and, yes, I sure did make a scene,” DaddyStrange captioned the original video, which now has over 5.1 million views. “Why are you doing that?” a flight attendant asked Larry after DaddyStrange pointed out he was sharing “inappropriate” images. “Just having a little fun,” he emotionlessly replied. “It’s sexual harassment … disgusting,” DaddyStrange told him, which the flight attendant agreed with. In the moment, Larry apologized, but according to the follow-up video posted Sunday, DaddyStrange claimed that Larry quickly went back to viewing the photo — which DaddyStrange claimed showed a woman giving him oral sex — on his iPad. “We do think he has a kink,” DaddyStrange said, gagging at the fact she “played into it.” The woman said that she and seven or eight other passengers met with the FBI once they landed and said that Larry was escorted off the plane. She doesn’t know if anything happened to Larry, but agents reportedly told her they were trying to book him for the weekend. No further information was immediately available on his status. “We can confirm this unfortunate incident occurred on a recent flight from Detroit to Denver,” a Southwest Airlines spokesperson told The Post. “Our Flight Attendants immediately addressed the situation and the Crew requested local law enforcement officers meet the flight upon arrival, which they did and subsequently apprehended the individual responsible. “Southwest Airlines maintains zero tolerance for this obscene and unacceptable behavior, and we offer our sincere apologies to the other Customers onboard.”
