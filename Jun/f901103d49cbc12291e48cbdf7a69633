Oh, baby! TikToker and mommy influencer Maddie Castellano went viral after posting a video announcing that she and her three best friends all got pregnant at the same time — twice. Castellano shared a video showing the group of besties including Randi Parks, Britnee Kent and Lo Beeston. “Some of you might remember the story of how me and my best friends all got pregnant at the same time,” she begins narrating the video with photos showing the four pregnant best friends. “All of our babies were born within weeks of each other and since birth they have been best friends,” Castellano explained. “We do so many things together and it’s been so fun that they’ve had little buddies since they were in the womb.” But their crazy luck didn’t end there. “Just a little over a year later, the same four of us found out that we were pregnant and expecting babies within months of each other,” she said. “Now all of our kids have best friends for life,” Castellano ends the video, showing a video of all the young moms and their bestie babies lined up on the beach. The video was posted in August 2021 and has since amassed more than 7.5 million views and thousands of comments — from a simple “This is so cuteeeeee” to input from viewers shocked by the happy coincidence. “They are so close they didn’t just sync periods, they synced pregnancies,” one viewer commented. “Do you ever confuse each other’s babies?” another asked, while one noted, “That’s so cute how 2 of them are Girls and 2 of them are boys! Idk why, but I find it [so] cute.” “This is my dream for me and my besties,” one said. One admirer even zeroed in on a particular plus side of the good timing. “I feel like this is every mom’s dream. What an incredible support system you have, too!” they wrote.
