Rep. Henry Cuellar, who is locked in a too-close-to-call race against AOC-backed Democratic Primary challenger Jessica Cisneros, accused a top Texas party official of accessing his private voter database before last month’s runoff election. Cuellar sent a letter to the co-executive directors of the Democratic Party to say he has “grave concerns” about political director Ryan Garcia, who he said “logged into my private VAN account without our authorization or consent” on April 25. The congressman added in the letter, sent Tuesday and obtained by The Post, that Garcia is a Cisneros supporter and claimed that Garcia apparently “used his official capacity to compromise my private campaign data.” The letter, addressed to Hannah Roe Beck and Jamarr Brown, asks the state party to conduct a “full forensic audit of his unauthorized intrusion” and investigate whether Garcia shared the campaign data with anyone. Cuellar said the alleged breach wasn’t uncovered until May 26, two days after a runoff election that showed him ahead of Cisneros by 177 votes. Cuellar has claimed victory over Cisneros, who has been backed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the far-left “Squad.” Cisneros has not conceded and no official winner has been declared as mail-in ballots are still being tallied. Cuellar, who has served in Congress since 2005, was dogged during the campaign over a raid of his home by the FBI in January and his stance against abortion. The Texas Democratic Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Post.
