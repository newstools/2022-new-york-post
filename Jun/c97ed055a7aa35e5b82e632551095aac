Americans are more likely to keep returning to a business if it’s family owned, a new survey says. The study by OnePoll for CG Roxane, surveyed 2000 adults with over two-thirds (67%) saying they trust local businesses and 64% trusting family-owned businesses. Comparatively, 59% responded they trust corporate multinationals and 61% rely on franchises. “It isn’t surprising that people view family-owned and operated businesses as more trustworthy,” CG Roxane Office & Human Resources Manager Cindy Miller said according to South West News Service, adding smaller organizations benefit the community as well. “But what people may not realize is that it also allows those businesses to make decisions quickly in response to community needs. This includes scholarship initiatives, and environmental and community partnerships,” Miller explained. “Not only does that enrich the lives of employees, but their families and friends at the local level across the country.” Respondents were also asked about their environmental behavior when making purchases, with 67% responding that they engage in environmentally-conscious behaviors or activities and just over half (51%)  saying they care deeply about the environmental impact of the businesses they support. More than half of those surveyed are willing to spend more money on goods that are locally sourced and 59% agree that it is easy to find those products in their area, with 60% said they are more likely to purchase bottled water sourced from a natural spring in their region, rather than trucked in from another part of the country. High costs (35%) and “imported” or “internationally sourced” language were reasons people were discourage from purchasing certain items. Over the last six months, 39% of those surveyed have purchased goods that are “locally owned,” 38% “environmentally friendly,” 37% “locally sourced,” and 35% “family-owned.”
