Every superstar NBA player is constantly linked to “legacy” talks, constantly compared to Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and other legends of the game. Kevin Durant always seems to find himself on the sour side of these conversations. After Steph Curry and the Warriors finished off the Celtics for their fourth championship in eight years Thursday night, social media turned away from the action on the court and took aim at Curry’s former teammate, again. “How does it feel to not be loved by any of the fans of the team you won back to back titles with all because you couldn’t help yourself from throwing shade at everyone in the organization whenever the opportunity arose?” one fan tweeted. Durant shot back, “Love will get u killed.” Responding to a fan who said that his legacy just “died,” Durant responded by saying, “I been dead since July 4th 2016” — the date he announced he would be joining the Warriors. Durant, who won two rings with Golden State, joined the team in 2016 after the Warriors won a championship in 2015. He then left in free agency for the Brooklyn Nets after the Warriors lost to the Raptors in the 2019 NBA Finals. Curry now has four championships, two with Durant and two without. It doesn’t appear that there is any bad blood between Durant and the Warriors themselves, as he congratulated them in his tweets,. But the dialogue is bound to continue until Durant secures a championship without Curry. Durant, who was eliminated by the Celtics in the first round of this year’s playoffs, is signed with Brooklyn through the 2025-2026 season.
