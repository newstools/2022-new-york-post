Can you rat out his hiding spot? If you can spot the mouse in this optical illusion in less than a minute, you may be a record holder. Created by Hungarian author-artist Gergely Dudás, the “seek-and-find” illustration depicts a maze of colorful mushrooms with a tiny mouse peeking out from behind one. Some eagle-eyed puzzle solvers reportedly spotted the pip squeak in 20 seconds. Others, however, were stumped by this mushroom maze. Sure, optical illusions such as this are often just a fun diversion — but they also hold real value for scientists. These brain teasers reportedly help researchers shed light on the inner machinations of the human mind and how it reacts to its surroundings. Dr Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at Goldsmiths University in London, once told The Sun that illusions are important to our understanding of the brain: “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you.” OK, are you ready to spot this mouse in record-setting time? [Warning: Spoilers coming up below]. If you’re still struggling to catch a glimpse of cute critter, direct your attention to the left-hand side of the image. About halfway down, you’ll see the white mouse’s ears and eyes poking out from behind an orange mushroom. Can you see it? Those who live for the thrill of solving an optical illusion could try their hand at spotting the blue-eye fox amongst a sea of its black-eyed peers. Or perhaps a better challenge would be to spot all six animals hidden in this drawing. Other more popular and recent optical illusions include finding all four women in this image, or revealing a character trait based on what you see in an illusion.
