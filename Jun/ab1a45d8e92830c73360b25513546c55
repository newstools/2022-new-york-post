Crime novelist James Patterson has issued an apology Tuesday following a prior remark on racism. Speaking to the UK’s Sunday Times this weekend, Patterson said that “white older male writers” aren’t getting hired for “writing gigs in film, theatre, TV or publishing” right now — claiming the phenomenon is “just another form of racism.” “What’s that all about? Can you get a job? Yes. Is it harder? Yes. It’s even harder for older writers. You don’t meet many 52-year-old white males,” he insisted. However, he is now taking that back. “I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work is a form of racism,” Patterson, 75, offered on Facebook Tuesday. “I absolutely do not believe that racism is practiced against white writers. Please know that I strongly support a diversity of voices being heard — in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.” Of course, the Facebook comments section had some thoughts on the apology. “I’m sorry you feel the need to be an apologist,” wrote one user, prompting a thread of debate. “Bias against white men is very real. It may be more recent but it is real nonetheless.” “Way to bend to pressure,” another commented. “The left has forced their beliefs again.” “Just write awesome books and stay out of politics and social issues,” another suggested. Patterson has sold more than 450 million books across 20 or so titles during his nearly 30-year career — most notably, the neo-noir book series following Detective Alex Cross, later played by actor Morgan Freeman in 1997’s “Kiss the Girls” and its 2001 sequel, “Along Came a Spider. His first autobiography, “James Patterson by James Patterson: The Stories of My Life,” hit bookstores just last week. Patterson also will produce the upcoming film “Run Rose Run,” based on the book he wrote with country music legend Dolly Parton, 76.
