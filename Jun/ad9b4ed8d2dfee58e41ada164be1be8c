Puzzling pictures show a strange unidentified creature roaming through a Texas zoo, leaving city officials dumbfounded. The mysterious night creature was spotted on a security camera at the Amarillo Zoo on May 21 at around 1:30 a.m. A still photo released by the zoo shows a lengthy creature standing on what appears to be its two legs outside the facility’s fence. “Was it a person with a strange hat who likes to walk at night? A large coyote on its hind legs? A Chupacabra? It is a mystery – for Amarillo to help solve,” the city said on their website. The zoo is calling it a UAO – Unidentified Amarillo Object, but the city is asking for the public’s help to identify the figure. “We just want to let the Amarillo community have some fun with this,” said Michael Kashuba, City of Amarillo (COA) Director of Parks and Recreation. “It is important to note that this entity was outside the Amarillo Zoo. There were no signs of attempted entry into the zoo.” The parks director said no animals or individuals were harmed, and there were no signs of criminal activity. “It is definitely a strange and interesting image. Maybe Amarillo can help solve the mystery of our UAO,” Kashuba added. Residents who think they can crack the mystery can contact the COA communications office at publiccommunications@amarillo.gov.
