Faith Hill didn’t have much faith in herself after starring in 2004’s “The Stepford Wives.” The country music icon, 54, wanted to quit acting for good following the film’s release. Hill — who played “Stepford” wife Sarah Sunderson — stopped by the “Kelly Clarkson Show” on Tuesday, explaining that raising a family and continuing her music career led to her acting hiatus. “My career took off, no time, had babies, and I had done a couple of things,” she said. The “Breathe” singer added, “I did ‘Stepford Wives’ with an amazing cast. But it wasn’t the best experience, so I said I will never ever, ever, ever, ever do another one, a movie.” The “American Idol” alum, 40, then asked why filming the Nicole Kidman-fronted movie wasn’t a pleasant experience. To which Hill replied back: “Because it’s so long. The waiting for me …” “It’s hurry up and wait,” Clarkson chimed in. “I cannot,” the “Voice” alum said. “I have to be busy, doing stuff. The,n I did an independent thing called ‘Dixieland’ [in 2015]. I read a lot of scripts over the years but nothing hit me or the timing wasn’t right.” Hill can next be seen alongside her husband Tim McGraw in the “Yellowstone” prequel “1883.” Of the western drama, Hill explained that “the script was so well written and I had honestly never read anything like that.” The mother of three previously dished about working with the “Not a Moment Too Soon” crooner, 55, in a February interview with CBS Mornings. “The stars lined up and it was a chance and opportunity that we couldn’t pass up,” she gushed at the time. She continued, “We’ve been married for 25 years. The thing we chose to do was not rehearse together [for ‘1883’]. We thought the spontaneity is going to be created the moment we set foot on set.”
