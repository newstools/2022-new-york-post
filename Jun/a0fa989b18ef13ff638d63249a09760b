She’s been called the first “realistic catfish” that people have seen. But Tatty Lomas admitted that “one wipe and it’s all over” as she took to TikTok to show off the incredible transformation. Her video began with Tatty displaying a flawless face of make-up as she sported a black tulle top and silver jewellery, with her brunette hair straight and sleek. Then, it switched to Tatty completely make-up free with messy hair. Her eyes looked slightly puffy, and she wore a white T-shirt and blue zip-up jumper. “Mood #onewipeanditsover #glowup #catfish,” she captioned the video. But people in the comments section were quick to praise her for sharing an honest look at what she looks like with no make-up and styling. “This is all of us – you still look cute,” one person wrote. While another added: “First realistic one I’ve seen, love it, still pretty.” “It’s the realness I need,” someone else commented. “Like, that is the point of make-up,” another comment read, as someone else agreed, writing: “Eyebrows still on fleek though”. “You’re beautiful, Tatty – this just proves it’s angles and lighting,” another person gushed. Tatty has 5.7 million likes on her TikTok page thanks to her sharing of make-up tutorials and tips. She’s also been weighing in on the latest series of Love Island, insisting of islander Gemma Owen: “I think Gemma is going to be this year’s Amber – I think we’re going to learn to love her.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
