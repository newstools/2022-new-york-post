The MLB has a loaded slate on Tuesday, and we have you covered with betting picks and props. Starting at 7 p.m. ET, the Yankees will host the Tampa Bay Rays, where Gerrit Cole matches up with Corey Kluber. Make sure to check out our full game preview from tipster and handicapper Michael Leboff, who has the best way to bet on that game. For the nightcap beginning at 10 PM est., the Angles travel slightly north to take on the Dodgers. Noah Syndergaard has his work cut out for him against a vaunted Dodger lineup that might just have his number from his time with the Mets.  Talk about someone who is licking his chops for tonight’s matchup. That man is Rays first baseman Ji-Man Choi who has had an impressive season thus far; to the tune of a .281 avg., five home runs, and 31 RBIs. Against Cole, Choi is 8/16 (.500 avg) with six extra-base hits, eight RBIs, three home runs, and an otherworldly 1.869 OPS. To say that he crushes Cole would be an understatement. Currently, BetMGM has the best line on his safest bet, just for him to get a hit. If you are looking for a more significant profit (and riskier bet), Choi to hit a home run is +450 on Caesars. This is the best line by a wide margin; most sportsbooks have it closer to +375. Take the value that Caesars is giving for this player prop bet. Hello, old friend. Noah Syndergaard was able to avoid the Mets last Sunday, but pick your poison. It is surprising to see him pick the Dodgers, as Freddie Freeman crushed Syndergaard in the past, hitting .435 with 10 hits in 23 at-bats. Five of those hits resulted in extra bases, and he has six career RBIs against Syndergaard. Syndergaard has done an excellent job keeping the ball in the yard, with just a 7.5% home run to fly ball ratio, per Fangraphs. This is a solid four percent below expected, so home-run bets are not recommended, even if regression is on its way. I’ll stick with Freeman to drive in at least one run, something that he has done plenty against Syndergaard.
