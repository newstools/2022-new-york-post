Christian Bale is open to doing another Batman movie — if Christopher Nolan is on board to direct again. The Oscar-winning actor played the titular tole in the “Dark Knight” trilogy from 2005 to 2012, revealing to Screen Rant what it would take to get him back in the Batsuit. “I had a pact with Chris Nolan,” Bale told the publication. “We said, ‘Hey, look. Let’s make three films, if we’re lucky enough to get to do that. And then let’s walk away. Let’s not linger too long.’ “In my mind, it would be something if Chris Nolan ever said to himself, ‘You know what, I’ve got another story to tell.’ And if he wished to tell that story with me, I’d be in.” Nolan’s trilogy began with “Batman Begins” in 2005, followed by “The Dark Knight” in 2008 and “The Dark Knight Rises” in 2012. Ben Affleck and Robert Pattinson have both pulled on their Batsuits to play the iconic role in recent years, with Bale admitting he’s yet to see Pattinson in “The Batman” — but he assured Variety he “will see it.” “Robert is an absolutely wonderful actor,” he said. “We bumped into each other, talked a little bit about it ahead of time, and I heard wonderful things.” Bale confirmed with the publication a fourth installment hasn’t been discussed yet, although he is about to enter another comic book universe — starring in Marvel’s “Thor: Love and Thunder,” which opens in theaters July 8. The actor looked unrecognizable in teasers for the action flick that were released in May, in which he donned heavy white and gray makeup and prosthetics.
