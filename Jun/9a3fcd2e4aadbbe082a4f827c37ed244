James Harden is taking one for the team. The Philadelphia 76ers star declined his $47.4 million player option for the 2022-23 season, instead opting to return to the team on a restructured contract in free agency, according to multiple reports. The selfless move now provides Philadelphia with financial flexibility they can use to fill several of the holes in their lineup. Harden joined the 76ers after being dealt by the Brooklyn Nets just hours before last season’s trade deadline. The acquisition cost the Sixers quite a substantial load, including Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Seth Curry and two first-round draft picks. Now one season removed from the trade, Philadelphia is looking to strengthen its lineup and push for an NBA championship. One player the 76ers have been repeatedly linked to is veteran forward P.J. Tucker. The 37-year-old reportedly verbally agreed to a three-year, $30 million contract with Philadelphia earlier this week, turning down opportunities to play with the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Keith Pompey. With Harden’s opt-out, the 76ers are one step closer to bringing in the coveted free agent. Despite declining his player option, it remains likely that Harden will play in Philadelphia for several years to come. 76ers President Daryl Morey has often expressed his infatuation towards the star shooting guard and is currently working with Harden on a new short-term max contract lasting three years, according to The Ringer. Harden’s opt-out comes just days after his former teammate, Kyrie Irving, opted into the final year of his contract with the Nets. Although a free agent, it’s unlikely Harden will be reuniting with the point guard in Brooklyn any time soon.
