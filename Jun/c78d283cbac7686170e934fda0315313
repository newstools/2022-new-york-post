Golf’s European tour struck back at its LIV defectors. The DP World Tour on Friday fined members who competed at the Saudi-backed league’s inaugural event £100,000 ($105,000) and banned them from competing in three upcoming events that are co-sanctioned with the PGA: the Scottish Open, the Barbasol Championship, and the Barracuda Championship. The Liv Golf players include Sergio Garcia, Graeme McDowell, Martin Kaymer, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Richard Bland. “Every action anyone takes in life comes with a consequence and it is no different in professional sport, especially if a person chooses to break the rules,” DP World Tour CEO Keith Pelley said, per Golf.com. “That is what has occurred here with several of our members. “Many members who I have spoken to in recent weeks expressed the viewpoint that those who have chosen this route have not only disrespected them and our Tour, but also the meritocratic ecosystem of professional golf that has been the bedrock of our game for the past half a century and which will also be the foundation upon which we build the next 50 years. “Their actions are not fair to the majority of our membership and undermine the Tour, which is why we are taking the action we have announced today.” PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan revoked Tour membership for golfers who competed for the Saudi-backed LIV Tour as soon as the first ball was struck in London, but that didn’t seem to faze more players from defecting. Brooks Koepka became the latest star to join the league, which has also poached the likes of Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed. LIV Golf will hold its next event at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in North Plains, Oregon, from June 30-July 2. The Scottish Open is set to begin July 7 at the Renaissance Club.
