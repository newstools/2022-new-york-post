Kevin Durant had an exciting, three-word response to Arch Manning’s decision to commit to the University of Texas. “Let’s get it,” Durant, who played college basketball at Texas, tweeted at Manning after the quarterback revealed he will join the Longhorns in 2023 after he graduates from Isidore Newman High School in New Orleans. On Thursday, Manning —  the nephew of quarterback legends Peyton and Eli Manning — used his first-ever tweet to share a photo of himself throwing in a Texas cut-off shirt, writing, “Committed to the University of Texas. #HookEm.” Manning announced his decision following one of the most-hyped recruitment campaigns that included visits to Georgia, Alabama, Clemson, LSU, Virginia, and Texas. The 18-year-old high-school prodigy has kept his recruitment process mostly private, which added to the anticipation of his decision. His verified Instagram and Twitter accounts contain just one post each and include the same bio: “High school student.” Manning has yet to partake in the booming name, image, and likeness business that many young athletes have joined and secured lucrative brand opportunities. In three years for Isidore Newman School, Manning has thrown for more than 6,300 yards and 81 touchdowns, along with 19 rushing scores. Durant, who played one season for the Longhorns before being drafted second overall in the 2007 NBA Draft, is currently embroiled in some offseason drama. This week, reports emerged that he could become disgruntled and demand a trade if Kyrie Irving leaves. Irving has until June 29 to pick up next year’s $36 million option.
