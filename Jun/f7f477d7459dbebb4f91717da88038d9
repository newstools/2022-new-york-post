One of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies ominously suggested that Ukraine might not exist in two years’ time. Dmitry Medvedev, former president and prime minister of the Russian Federation, who currently serves as deputy head of the country’s Security Council, took to his Telegram channel Wednesday to muse about Ukraine’s attempts to secure gas imports from its Western allies. “I saw a report that Ukraine wants to receive from its overseas masters [liquified natural gas] as part of a land-lease plan with payment for delivery after 2 years,” Medvedev wrote. “Otherwise the country will freeze next winter. “But here’s a question. Who said that after two years Ukraine will even exist on the world map? “But it makes no difference to the Americans – they are so invested in their ‘anti-Russia’ project, that everything else is trivial to them.” Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, targeted Medvedev on Twitter, accusing the saber-rattling Kremlin insider of being the embodiment of Russian imperialism. “A small man with huge insecurities, who sprinkles poison towards Ukraine or threatens the world as the only way to assert oneself,” Podolyak tweeted. “Ukraine was, is and will be. The question is where would Dmitry Medvedev be in two years.” Medvedev has been vocal in his support for what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now in its fourth month. The ex-president has used his social media platform to rail against Ukraine and its foreign allies, which have been sending billions of dollars worth of weapons and military equipment to help the country fight off the invaders. Earlier this month, Medvedev warned Western countries that they should not wait for the “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,” but instead try to find a diplomatic solution to dealing with Russia.
