Amazon is on the verge of adding Ryan Fitzpatrick as a Thursday Night Football studio analyst. Let’s put this idea under the SportsClicker Microscope™: 1. I’m high on Fitzpatrick’s potential because of what we have seen publicly and from talking with broadcasters and producers I trust who have met with him over the years. 2. FitzMagic, as he was nicknamed, had a cult classic type of career. He had some streaks where he was the best quarterback on earth for a couple of weeks, which was inevitably followed by a rash of interceptions and then a new team.
