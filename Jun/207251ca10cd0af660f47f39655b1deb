The Giants’ offensive line troubles were not exactly must-see TV out in Indianapolis, where Mark Glowinski spent the last four years starting pretty much every game at right guard for the Colts. But some news travels even when no one is waiting for a delivery. The woes of the Giants and their dismal offensive line could not be confined to East Rutherford, N.J. “The media makes sure that everything is put out in the open, so just league-wide if something is not working right, there’s always an excuse or whatever is going on,’’ Glowinski said. The excuses — and reasons — behind the Giants’ struggles in the past decade, and especially in the past five years, focused on what could not be accomplished on offense. And the main culprit for those foibles was easy to spot: The offensive line was in shambles. It also was evident that there would be no real improvement for the Giants as a whole unless they got their line in order. Glowinski’s arrival in free agency this past March is living proof of this.
