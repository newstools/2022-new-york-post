A new poll reveals the stark political divisions in the country over the striking down of Roe v. Wade — with about 77% of Democrats calling it a  “step backward” and 64% of Republicans seeing it as a “step forward.” Only 13% of Democrats said they consider Friday’s US Supreme Court ruling a “step forward,” as do 24% of independents, the CBS News survey released Sunday found. Roughly 20% of Republicans call it a “step backward” along with 55% of independents. Overall, 52% of those polled see the court’s momentous decision as a “step backward,” 31% say it’s a “step forward,” and 17% say it’s neither. About 59% of Americans disapprove of the decision, including 67% of women. Forty-one percent approve, as do 33% of women. The poll was taken Friday and Saturday after the court struck down the 1973 landmark case upholding a woman’s right to have an abortion — a decision that brought tears of joy to anti-abortion advocates and anger and dismay to pro-choice groups. Republicans by 78% approved of the high court’s action, along with 38% of independents and 17% of Democrats, the poll shows. Disapproving were 83% of Democrats, 22% of Republicans and 62% of independents. Among the Americans who said they support overturning Roe v. Wade, 79% described feeling “hopeful,” 70% said they were “happy” and “relieved,” 51% chose “motivated,” 47% said “surprised” and 12% noted they were “scared.” Among those who wanted Roe v. Wade upheld, 78% said they were “upset,” 72% described being “angry,” 62% said “scared,” 38% said “surprised,” 32% said they were “motivated” and 10% were “hopeful.” Americans were evenly divided at 32% over whether abortion in their state should be legal in all cases or in most cases, while 27% said it should be illegal in most cases, and 9% said it should be illegal in all cases. Roughly 58% favored Congress passing a federal law making abortion legal, while 42% were opposed. Asked about what effect the ruling may have on how much they will be involved in this November’s midterm elections, 50% of Democrats said it will make them “more likely” to vote, a sentiment that 28% of independents and 20% of Republicans agree with. But 77% of Republicans, 61% of independents and 42% of Democrats said the decision will have no effect on their involvement. Small percentages — 8% of Democrats, 10% of independents and 3% of Republicans — say it will make them “less likely” to go to the polls. The poll surveyed 1,591 adults and has a plus/minus 3 percentage points margin of error.
