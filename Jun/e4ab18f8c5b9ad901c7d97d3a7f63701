“I was shocked at how bad this place is.” That’s Mayor Adams’ 100% correct verdict on the dysfunction New York is currently dealing with, especially on crime and public safety. Kudos to the mayor for getting it right. But we have to ask: You really didn’t know? Hmm. Maybe you should have consulted The Post then. Just skim a small sample of some of our recent stories: That’s just this weekend; we covered the same issues back in January. Look, Adams has a difficult job. He has to bring back to life a city crushed by terrible COVID rules, disastrous state criminal-justice laws and at least one DA who coddles crooks. To say nothing of the massive mess he inherited from his predecessor, whose left-field policies set the stage for the problems we see today on everything from crime to schools to the economy. Adams is making progress, driving down murders and shootings, trying to innovate policing and pushing ahead to help all New Yorkers. But he’s a former cop: public safety is his specialty. Surely he knew how bad things were. If not, perhaps he should read this paper a bit more.
