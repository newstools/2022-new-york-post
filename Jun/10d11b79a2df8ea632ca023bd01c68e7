Alvin Kamara is “bracing” for a six-game suspension stemming from a brawl he was involved in at a Las Vegas hotel during Pro Bowl week, according to Pro Football Talk. The Saints star running back was arrested and charged with felony battery after he, Chiefs cornerback Chris Lammons, and two others allegedly beat up a man at Drai’s After Hours night club in Las Vegas on Feb. 5, the day before the Pro Bowl at Allegiant Stadium. Kamara played in the game, but was questioned by police and arrested immediately after it ended. He admitted to throwing punches in the incident. Kamara now faces a likely six-game suspension under the league’s personal conduct policy, though it remains unclear when that suspension will be handed down. The league often waits for legal proceedings to be carried out before suspending players, and Kamara has a hearing scheduled for August. According to Outkick, Kamara and the three other men beat up the victim so badly that they broke his eye socket and sent him to the hospital. It was there that the authorities showed up, and gathered the information they needed to arrest Kamara. If the star running back were to serve the suspension in 2022, it would likely derail big plans the Saints have for him this season. New Orleans largely chose to run back their roster from 2021, re-signing Jameis Winston to play quarterback and promoting defensive coordinator Dennis Allen to head coach after Sean Payton’s retirement. The five-time Pro Bowler tallied 1,337 rushing and receiving yards and nine total touchdowns in 13 games in 2021.
