The time has come to celebrate the most hole-y “holiday” of all: National Donut Day. Friday, June 3, marks the annual observance, and fast foodies around the country are celebrating with free sweet rolls, buy-one-get-one-free deals and more. Some chains, such as Krispy Kreme and Duck Donuts, are giving away freebies, no purchase necessary. Others like Dunkin’ — née Dunkin’ Donuts — require customers to buy any drink to receive a complimentary pastry. For uninformed fried-dough lovers, the US staggeringly consumes more than 10 billion donuts per year, according to the Simmons National Consumer Survey. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 96% of Americans reported that they enjoy munching on the sugary treat. Fun fact: The annual event was concocted by the Salvation Army in Chicago in 1938 to honor their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I.

Customers of the Canada-based chain who register for Tim’s Rewards and buy a doughnut through the Tims app can then score a free doughnut on their next order. The deal is available until Sunday, June 5.
