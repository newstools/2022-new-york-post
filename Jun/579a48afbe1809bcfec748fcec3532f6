Tempers are high as the Eastern Conference Finals head back to Tampa. At the end of the Lightning’s 3-1 win over the Rangers on Thursday night in Game 5 at Madison Square Garden, the fists began flying. Bolts captain Steven Stamkos and Rangers forward Alexis Lafreniere jawed at one another behind Igor Shesterkin’s net before dropping the gloves. The pair received fighting majors on the scoresheet for their troubles. Stamkos and Lafreniere weren’t the only pair to engage in some post-buzzer shenanigans. Tampa Bay’s Erik Cernak and Rangers defenseman Adam Fox received two minutes apiece for slashing one another, while Blueshirts center Ryan Strome also earned a pair for slashing Cernak. Losers of three straight, frustrations are boiling over for the Rangers, who must win Saturday’s Game 6 in Tampa to keep their season alive.
