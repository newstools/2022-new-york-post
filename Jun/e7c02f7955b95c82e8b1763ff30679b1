Johnny Depp told a mob of adoring fans in the UK on Thursday night that he’s “still in shock” about winning his bombshell defamation suit against Amber Heard — and even cracked a joke about his severed finger. The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star was captured on video laughing as dozens of admirers congratulated him on this week’s win as he emerged from his friend rocker Jeff Beck’s Newcastle gig. “Thank you, I’m still in shock a little,” Depp revealed to one celebratory fan. As the actor posed for photos and signed autographs, he joked with a young boy in the crowd about losing part of his finger in an alleged fight with his ex-wife in Australia in 2015. “You have five, I have four and seven-eighths. Mad,” Depp told the boy. Depp’s severed finger was brought up repeatedly during the lurid six-week trial in Fairfax, Va., as the “Edward Scissorhands” star testified that the tip of his finger was chopped off when Heard allegedly threw a vodka bottle at him. “For those asking, Johnny was genuinely the nicest man,” a fan named Jay tweeted shortly after her Thursday encounter with the star. “He took his time to talk and thank everyone and signed as much as he could given the time and space he had, he especially took time to thank and talk to the young children who were waiting.” The actor has been in the UK since jurors started deliberating his case — and he remained there when the verdict was handed down Wednesday. Jurors ended up awarding Depp $10.4 million in damages.
