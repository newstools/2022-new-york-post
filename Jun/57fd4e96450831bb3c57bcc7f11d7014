Robbie Anderson’s threats to hang up the cleats lasted all of one day. The former New York Jets wide receiver revealed Saturday in a since-deleted tweet that he was considering retiring from football. “Ain’t gone lie Thinking bout Retiring …” Anderson announced to his 43,500 Twitter followers. Anderson’s tweet comes just one year after the former undrafted wide receiver signed a two-year, $29.5 million contract extension with the Carolina Panthers that extends through the 2023 season. If he were to walk away from the sport, Anderson would likely be forced to pay back $7.6 million of his unearned signing bonus, as well as a healthy portion of his restructuring bonus from this year. Fans were quick to speculate that Anderson’s decision to retire was the result of him catching wind of the Panthers’ plans to trade for Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield. After rumors of the quarterback possibly being traded to Carolina surfaced in April, Anderson commented on a Panthers fan account on Instagram to express his disapproval. Others linked Anderson’s current unhappiness to perhaps being fed up with the lackluster play of longtime quarterback Sam Darnold, who played with the wide receiver both on the Jets and now Panthers. Anderson was seen appearing to yell at the struggling signal caller on the sideline last season amid a 24-6 loss to the Patriots, during which Darnold threw three interceptions. The Panthers will begin their mandatory minicamp Tuesday, with or without Anderson. As of now, it seems he will be making an appearance.
