Yankees infielder Matt Carpenter has already won the hearts of Yankees fans just a week after joining the team. Carpenter, an 11-year MLB vet, hit a leadoff homer against Shohei Ohtani after the 11th pitch at-bat in Thursday’s first game of a split doubleheader versus the Angels. Gleyber Torres would add a solo home run of his own in the first to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead after the first inning. The former Cardinals third baseman, 36, now has three hits as a Yankee — and they’re all home runs. Kyle Higashioka and Alfonso Soriano were the other Yankees to accomplish the unique feat of having their first three hits all be home runs in pinstripes. Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge recently joined fans in welcoming Carpenter to the Bronx. “He’s a good presence in this clubhouse,” said Judge. “He’s a veteran guy that always has quality at-bats. He’s had some big homers for us. He had another big two-run homer tonight. And he’s another guy I’m talking to after his at-bats, ‘Hey, what are you seeing from Syndergaard? What did you see in the past?’ “Anytime you’ve got a veteran guy that’s been around in the league and has seen all different guys, he’s going to help your ballclub.”
