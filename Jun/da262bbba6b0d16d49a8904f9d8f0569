Jackson Mahomes was not off limits when trash talk commenced ahead of “The Match” golf event in Las Vegas. On Tuesday, Aaron Rodgers — who will team up with Tom Brady to take on Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen — appeared to crack a joke at Jackson’s expense while trolling the Chiefs quarterback. “When you open your phone, what social apps do you check first?” Rodgers was asked in a Q&A video before “The Match.” “Probably Instagram. It used to be Twitter, when Twitter was fun,” the reigning NFL MVP said. “Pat I’m sure is a big TikToker. Runs in the family.” Mahomes’ younger brother’s social media presence stirred headlines throughout the last NFL season, including when Jackson faced backlash last October for dancing on the late Sean Taylor’s logo during a memorial game in Washington. In April, Jackson was called out by a business on TikTok for allegedly scamming the company. That came after he was ripped by a Kansas City bar that claimed in a December social media post that Jackson was rude to staffers at the establishment. Patrick Mahomes shut down a report in April that claimed he had a sit-down with his brother and wife, Brittany Matthews, about their viral antics last season — including the time Jackson poured water on Ravens fans for taunting him last September. In March, Jackson shared selfies to Instagram, with somber messages about the media attention he’d received. “I hate media/news it’s destroying my life…” he wrote at the time, according to Awesemo. In a second selfie post, he added, “broken/sad/disrespected.” Jackson’s posts came after he wasn’t photographed at his brother’s bachelor party, which took place last weekend in Las Vegas.
