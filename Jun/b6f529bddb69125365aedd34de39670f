At least three people were killed and a number of semi-trailer trucks erupted into flames on I-30 in Arkansas on Wednesday after a horrific crash involving three separate pile-ups with at least a dozen vehicles, cops said. Photo and video from the scene near Friendship, Arkansas showed no less than four eighteen-wheelers piled up on the westbound side of the highway. Two of the vehicles appeared to be engulfed in flames — while the two others had lost their cargo, according to the images, which showed one truck’s trailer split open in the highway’s grassy median. Other images showed huge amounts of smoke billowing up into the sky above the interstate. Officials on the scene told a reporter from KARK-TV that at least three people have died due to the crash. Troopers had yet to account for all individuals at the scene as of 3 p.m. Wednesday, the Fayetteville Flyer reported.
