Phew! Cuckoo for Coco Gauff at +500 to win the French Open, but thought better of it. Another win. While Queen Elizabeth has lasted 70 years, Coco couldn’t stay with Iga Swiatek for 70 minutes. Adam Wainwright (5-4, 2.75) is a couple of years away from celebrating his jubilee as well. Ageless Adam was starting to show his age (40), but looked like an ace again in his last start. He shut out the Padres for seven innings, scattering two hits while fanning 10. The Cards are in Chicago taking on the hated Cubs. Justin “The Animal” Steele (1-5, 5.40) has been turnbuckled for 10 runs over his last seven innings. The Cubs have been better on the road than they have at Wrigley this year. Play 10 units on the Red Birds. Red Sox 8, A’s 0. Everyone wearing red hit. Alex Verdugo had three. Nick Pivetta with a two-hitter over seven. We’ve won 17 of our last 20. Up +844 goolagongs.
