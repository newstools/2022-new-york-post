Queen Elizabeth II posted a touching tribute to her late dad King George VI on Sunday in celebration of Father’s Day. Her royal highness, 96, posted a snap of her smiling with her father in 1946. “Wishing all of our followers a very happy Father’s Day,” the caption on the royal family’s Instagram account read. King George VI died in 1952, leaving the queen to ascend to the throne. Britain’s Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also posted a picture on Instagram to celebrate Father’s Day. The photo shows Prince William, the queen’s grandson, smiling with his three children: George, 8, Charlotte, 7, and Louis, 4.
