The Seattle Seahawks seem to be surviving post-Russell Wilson. Seattle’s head coach Pete Carroll told reporters his two new quarterbacks, Drew Lock and Geno Smith, have “been really impressive” after the team’s minicamp wrapped up earlier this month. Carroll added the two QBs “shared a ton of reps” during the three-day mandatory session. “They look in control,” Carroll told reporters. “They’ve done a terrific job so far.” Drew Lock, who played with the Broncos before he was traded to Seattle for Russell Wilson this March, was inconsistent during his three years in Denver. During the past two seasons of Lock’s career, his record was 4-12. Geno Smith, on the other hand, has been Wilson’s backup for the last three seasons. The former Jets quarterback started in the beginning of his career before injuries made him lose his spot. Smith bounced between two different teams – the Giants and Chargers –  on one year deals before ending up in Seattle. Carroll, who helped morph the Seahawks into perennial playoff contenders during the 2010s, said he’s confident in both Lock and Smith – at least for this season. The head coach will look to preseason games to see which quarterback wins out the starting job. “The games are going to be important, and everything will be important,” Carroll said. “It’s going to be a real battle. It’s going to be really an exciting time for our team, for those guys in particular, and for our people watching. I’m pumped about it. I really am.”
