Tony La Russa had a bizarre explanation for a bizarre decision. During the White Sox’s 11-9 loss to the Dodgers on Thursday, Trea Turner was batting with a runner on and had a 1-2 count. Inexplicably, La Russa called for Turner to be intentionally walked – again – with two strikes. Max Muncy proceeded to hit a three-run home run off Bennett Sousa to put the Dodgers ahead 10-5. After the home run, Muncy appeared to look in La Russa’s direction and yell, “You f–king walk him with two strikes. F–k you, bitch!” Asked about his thought process on Turner’s intentional walk, La Russa struggled to comprehend how he was being second-guessed. “Let me ask you something: Is there a question about whether that was a good move or not?” La Russa asked. “Do you know what he hits against left-handed pitchers with two strikes? Is that really a question? Turner with a strike left against a left-hander is something you can avoid if you can. We had an open base and Muncy happened to be the guy behind him, and that’s a better matchup. “If someone disagrees, that’s the beauty of this game. Welcome to it.” For an idea of how rare it is for a hitter to be intentionally walked when he’s behind in the count with two strikes, veteran baseball scribe Joe Sheehan tweeted, “We only have by count data back to 1988, but this appears to be the first-ever intentional walk issued on a 1-2 count.” The loss dropped the White Sox to 26-29 this season.
