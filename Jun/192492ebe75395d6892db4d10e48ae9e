A brand new quiz can determine everything about your personality — including those traits you try to keep at bay. The “What The F**K Is Wrong With You?” quiz has gone viral thanks to its tongue-in-cheek questions and even more cheeky analysis — and the clue is in the title. All you have to do is answer the 11 weird and wonderful questions via website Uquiz. And you’re thrown right into the deep end, as it begins with a big one — “You’re immortal and you can choose one thing to keep you company for your eternal life.” Some of the options on the table include “an infinite Spotify subscription” or “some kind of animal companion.” Other burning questions that will need answering range from deciding which name of guitar or band you prefer — and there’s some pretty random options to select from. Elsewhere, there’s also a question that simply asks “Do you like The Beatles?”, followed by which high-profile figure you’d choose to kill if given the chance. The eleventh and final question, however, is not multiple choice like the others. Instead the answer is in your hands, as it reads: “Okay but seriously please suggest a name for my guitar.” Once all 11 questions have been answered and submitted, it’s time to find out your result. And here’s where things get really interesting, as you find out which of your answers married up with a particular personality trait. Before you read your result, it’s worth taking into consideration that the quiz was not made by a professional and is meant to be taken with its tongue firmly in its cheek, so it is pretty savage. Results include “crippling loneliness”, “spending all your formative years online” and “gifted kid burnout.” Other phrases you could be described as are “buzzkill” and others had “victim complex” with equally scathing analysis.
