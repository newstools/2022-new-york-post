Drill rapper Gino Mondana was arrested in connection with a Bronx shooting that stemmed from a fender bender, law enforcement sources said. The “Hottest Winter Ever” artist, whose real name is Tray Stroman, was charged Friday with attempted murder, assault, menacing and harassment in connection with an April 1 attack in the borough’s Woodstock section, sources said. Stroman was involved in a minor car accident in front of 725 Southern Blvd. around 4:30 a.m. and at first told the driver of the other car he’d pay for the damages, police sources said. But Stroman pulled a gun on the 23-year-old driver when they couldn’t agree on the amount, according to the sources. The rapper then fired several shots at the victim, who suffered several wounds to his left leg, sources said. The Foreign Side Records artist is from East Flatbush and is the younger brother of rapper Fivio Foreign, according to Hip Hop Weekly. Fivio Foreign was among the drill rappers who met with Mayor Eric Adams earlier this year after the Democrat slammed the nihilistic genre for promoting violence.
