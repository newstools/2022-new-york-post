Most of us have been through breakups, and we often change our physical appearance after to feel better. But one woman has revealed she took her glow-up to far after her boyfriend broke up with her. Frances Ledger posted the video on TikTok which has since gone viral with over 350k views. In the before and after pictures, Frances looks like an entirely different person. She showed a photo of her before her makeover, with long brown hair and stunning natural features. She suggested her ex told her: “Your ugly, I don’t want you anymore and nobody else will.” In the next clip, Frances showed how she looks now after dying her hair bleach blonde, getting surgery and filler. She also said she had no confidence since her makeover and said the breakup did in fact break her. Frances claimed her makeover was all for a boy, and that she would never do it again. Viewers of the video rightly pointed out that Frances was stunning even before getting any surgery and that her ex definitely didn’t deserve her. One wrote: “Girl you were naturally pretty, and you’re still pretty now. The only issue is, you don’t see it. You are honestly beautiful.” “You were perfect. No man should make you want to change yourself. There are so many men who would love to be with you,” added another. A third commented: “I’m so sorry that happened to you girl, you didn’t deserve that you’ve always been so gorgeous.” “Girl you are beautiful before and after, and always remember your worth!” exclaimed a fourth.
