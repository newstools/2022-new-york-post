Some women are truly blessed with detective skills and can sniff out a cheater from a mile away. A young woman on TikTok named Jedda was certainly blessed with those skills and discovered what her boyfriend was doing behind her back with just the tiniest of clues. In a video, she revealed the sneaky way she caught her boyfriend of over two years cheating on her. Jedda wrote: “When you catch your boyfriend cheating because you recognized his breakfast order and thumb in another girl’s Instagram post.” She also credited her investigative skills to her astrological sign and wrote in the video’s caption: “I’m a Scorpio what did you expect?” Considering Jedda was able to spot her boyfriend from a plate of food and a sliver of his thumb, her skills are pretty impressive. In the comments section, Jedda explained that she didn’t know the other woman, but she was also being lied to by Jedda’s boyfriend and didn’t know he was already in a relationship. She added: “I’m not sure if she’s still with him but I went no contact straight away (after much gaslighting) and he still maintains he didn’t cheat hahaha.” “It all only happened like a week ago but when her and I compared what we knew I realized he’s been cheating on me almost the entire 2.5 years.” Several fans also took to the comments section to praise Jedda for her remarkable detective skills. One wrote: “As a Scorpio we claim you.” Another added: “Why are Scorpios the best detectives?” “Some of us are FBI agents undercover,” a third comment read. Someone else commented: “Y’all professionals I thought I was good.” In case you need further proof that women will always catch a cheater, one woman shared how she caught her boyfriend cheating thanks to his Apple watch. Additionally, another woman found out her date was cheating when she saw a suspicious item in an Instagram photo. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
