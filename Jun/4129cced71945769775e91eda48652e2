April, May and June are wonderful for many reasons that have nothing to do with what is going on around the NFL. It is a time of renewal in nature and for football teams that came out of a long, cold winter very much worse for wear. The NFL Draft comes during this span, and there is no more expedient way to enliven a roster than by selecting a handful of talented rookies. The offseason workout program gives returning players the opportunity to show off their improved physiques. On cue, the largest players detail their weight loss and body-fat reductions, and the smaller players reveal the “extra 10 pounds of muscle” that they hope will make all the difference. It is always remarkable how so much conversation during up to 10 organized team activity practices and the ensuing three-day mandatory minicamp centers on how players look bigger, stronger and faster. For others coming off lingering injuries or physical issues, the word is they are “on pace” to return for the start of training camp. The months of April, May and June were predictably kind to the Giants. They benefited from a dismal 2021 season with what may turn out to be a draft bounty. They broke in a new head coach, Brian Daboll, his new coaching staff and so many newcomers to a roster that was severely lacking.
