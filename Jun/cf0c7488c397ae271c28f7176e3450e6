A teen driver who was allegedly at the wheel during a Brooklyn wreck that left three dead has been charged, nearly two years after the collision, cops said Wednesday. Tamirlan Abylkhnov, 18, of Brooklyn was arrested Wednesday and charged with criminally negligent homicide, assault and reckless endangerment in connection to the fatal two-car crash at Floyd Bennett Field in July 2020. Abylkhnov, who was 16 at the time, was allegedly doing “donuts” at the park just after 8 p.m. that night when he lost control of his 2020 Toyota Camry and slammed into the side of a 2014 Kia Forte with four people inside, cops said at the time. The driver of the Kia, Emil Badalov, 16, and his two passengers, Margarita Sidgiyayeva, 18, and her brother, Daniel Sidgiyayeva, 11, all died, cops said. The fourth person in the KIA, a 16-year-old girl, was seriously injured but survived, cops said. Abylkhnov and his two passengers, a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man, walked away with minor injuries, according to police.
