In a big blow to Albany lefties, a controversial bill that would seal most New Yorkers’ criminal convictions failed to pass before the state legislative session concluded Saturday morning. Although lawmakers worked throughout Friday night passing other legislation, the state Assembly let the so-called “Clean Slate Act” expire. If signed into law, it would seal criminal records seven years after sentencings for felonies – excluding sex crimes — and three years after sentencings for misdemeanors. The state Senate passed the measure Wednesday, with a half dozen Democrats joining Republicans in voting no. Sen. Zellnor Myrie (D-Brooklyn), who sponsored the bill’s Senate version, said he’s not giving up. “Anyone who knows me knows that I’ve given my heart and soul to pass Clean Slate,” he tweeted Saturday. “So it goes without saying that I’m beyond disappointed we could not get it across the finish line this year. But hope is a discipline. We will be back. We will be better. And we will win.” If approved, the measure was expected to automatically seal more than 2 million New Yorkers conviction records. Proponents of the measure say ex-cons deserve a clean slate while seeking second chances — especially while trying to secure jobs.. However, many opponents on both sides of the political aisle have said failing to disclose prior convictions would make it difficult for employers and landlords to conduct proper background checks – potentially putting children and other vulnerable New Yorkers in jeopardy.
