Paige Spiranac has swooped in with jokes about Brooks Koepka joining LIV Golf. Shortly after news broke Tuesday that Koepka would defect from the PGA Tour to join the Saudi-backed golf league, Spiranac joined the chorus on Twitter weighing in. “Brooks Koepka going to LIV is not surprising. He’s said he only cares about majors and finding new ways to make Bryson’s life miserable,” she wrote. Koepka, a two-time US Open champ and the winner of two PGA Championships, is the latest high-profile golfer to join the controversial LIV Golf league, along with his rival, Bryson DeChambeau. Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed and Sergio Garcia are among other prominent golfers who are now on the LIV Golf tour, which is being fronted by golf legend Greg Norman. Norman, a former world No. 1, has stumbled in speaking to the media in recent months in attempts to downplay human rights concerns associated with the Saudi government. The Saudi-backed league has been spending an exorbitant amount of money for the tour, with Mickelson and Johnson reportedly receiving nine-figure paydays. As of Tuesday afternoon, the terms of Koepka’s agreement with LIV have not yet been announced. This isn’t the first time Spiranac has zinged golfers over their decision to join LIV. Earlier this month, she expressed how transparency in statements would be welcomed. “These elaborate statements are annoying. No one going to the LIV tour actually cares about the progression of the game. I wish they just said ‘because it’s a s–t ton of money,” she tweeted at the time. In addition to Spiranac, fellow golfer Max Homa also joked about would-be negotiations among players in the wake of the Koepka news. Koepka competed at the US Open this past weekend, less than a month after marrying longtime girlfriend Jena Sims in Turks and Caicos.
