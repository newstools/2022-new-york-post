Bob Scanlan, field reporter for the San Diego Padres, had an eventful evening on Tuesday. With the Padres in St. Louis, Scanlan appeared to be caught on a hot mic, and also got hit in the noggin by a foul ball. While play-by-play broadcaster Don Orsillo was talking, Scanlan appeared to interrupt, taking a shot at Padres starting pitcher Blake Snell. “He gets scared of his fastball,” Scanlan can be heard saying. “I never know what he’s trying to do, to be honest with you. I don’t know that he does half the time.” Orsillo just kept it moving, not acknowledging Scanlan’s comments about Snell, further reinforcing the idea that it was a mistake that they aired. Earlier in the night, Scanlan had been struck in the head by a foul ball during the game. “There’s nothing to damage in there, so we’re safe, it’s all good,” Scanlan quipped. “There’s nothing inside the head to hurt, so we’re good. Thanks for checking though!” Kudos to Scanlan for having the presence of mind to make a few self-deprecating zingers after what had to be a harrowing moment.
