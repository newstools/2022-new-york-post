It’s time to see if you can really hit those high notes. Spotify has a new karaoke mode that lets a user sing along to whatever song is playing and then gives them a score based on their vocal performance. The mode, which is being quietly tested out, has not been formally announced by Spotify yet but has been surfacing through screenshots on social media. This is supposed to be an addition to their lyrics features that allows users to scroll through a song’s lyrics in real time. People who have access to this feature say that a “sing” button appears in the corner of the song’s icon, which then cuts out the backtrack vocals so only the music is playing, and lets someone put on their own private concert. At the end of the song, they are giving an “accuracy score” along with a cheesy inspiring message such as, “Nice one! You’re on the road to becoming famous!” No one is certain exactly where the score comes from or how the percentage is calculated, with some people speculating that Spotify employees are controlling the score themselves. Spotify has yet to say anything on the matter. A spokesperson told the Daily Mail, “At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience. Some of those end up paving the path for our broader user experience and others serve only as important learnings. We have no further news to share on future plans at this time.” Because the karaoke mode is said to be in its trial phase, not every Spotify user will have access to it. You’ll know if you’re part of that lucky group if you can see the special “sing” button. If you’re an avid singer and don’t see it, try updating the app.
