Do you feel trapped in your life? An optical illusion may reveal your true thoughts. When you look at the image, what do you see first? The illusion was shared on YouTube, and some people see a series of white pillars against a black background. However, others notice the silhouette of two men looking at one another with a white background behind. But what do they mean? According to the video, if you saw the pillars first, you prefer to “live life safely in your comfort zone and in an area where you know that you can succeed.” It adds: “Is it really success if you are trapped beneath a low glass ceiling? “The only way to break through and to truly feel the joys of success and accomplishment in life will be to venture into the uncomfortable unknown and shoot for the stars.” If you saw the men first, it is better news, as you are said to not feel trapped in your life. It explains: “You live a life of adventure and excitement, moving from one challenge to the next and feeding off the adrenaline. “You dread the idea of settling into a boring routine life more than anything else, but you need to acknowledge that there are benefits to finding some element of routine and normalcy.” So what did you get?
