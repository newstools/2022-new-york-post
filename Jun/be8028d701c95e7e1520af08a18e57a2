This horse sometimes says “neigh” to working. A mare named Sugar has gone viral for pretending to be asleep when she doesn’t feel like working. In the original tweet by user Jim Rose, a photo shows Sugar resting on her side in the grass as if taking a snooze while the text reads, “Meet Sugar, she doesn’t like to be ridden. If Sugar is approached with a saddle she lies down and pretends to be asleep. Sugar refuses to open her eyes until the riders leave.” Many have evidently found their spirit animal in Sugar, with the tweet so far racking in 433,000 likes and nearly 40,000 retweets. Responses varied, with some users praising Sugar. One said, “That’s the horse version of saying your piece and walking away.” Another noted: “I mean, a horse, AN EQUINE, somehow understands feigning sleep to get out of undesirable labor? Understands non-violent resistance?? Excellent non-compliance, Comrade Sugar. Remain ungovernable.” Others were concerned Sugar was dying. “Omg I want her to get up like isn’t laying down bad for horses wtf I have never seen a horse laying down. I thought they didn’t do that unless they were literally dying. Woah,” said one user. But according to horse enthusiasts in the replies, horses do actually lie down to sleep. Per animal behavior expert Dr. Susan Hazel, the tendency is more common for the species during heavier, or REM, sleep. Then there were some follow-up tweets claiming that the photo of Sugar was simply a stock image, adding that, were “you” familiar with Rose’s feed, “you would see that his followers would not take this seriously.” Rose’s Twitter DMs are closed at this time and he did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.
