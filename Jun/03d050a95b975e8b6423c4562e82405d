A stranger slashed a teen with a boxcutter and robbed her on a Bronx train Thursday afternoon, cops said. The 19-year-old victim was on a No. 6 train at the Parkchester station around 12:15 p.m. when a man approached her and demanded, “Give me your watch and phone. Stay on the train,” authorities said. He then slashed her on the arm and chin, and snatched her phone and necklace, police said. The victim was treated on scene by EMS, cops said. The suspect, who cops say wore a black hoodie, white mask and black pants, ran off after the attack and was still being sought about an hour later.
