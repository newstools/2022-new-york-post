Years ago, DeSean Jackson clashed with Donovan McNabb, and it had nothing to do with how many times he was targeted. While a guest on the “I Am ATHLETE” podcast with LeSean McCoy, Brandon Marshall and Adam “Pacman” Jones, Jackson broke down the relationship and how it went sour. It all revolved around his 2009 Pro Bowl selection as a punt returner and wide receiver. “When the ballots came out, and they found out that I was the first player in NFL history to get elected to start in the Pro Bowl for two positions, my starting quarterback tells [backup] Michael Vick, ‘Damn, I don’t think he should’ve got that. He shouldn’t have deserved that,’ ” Jackson said. “Like, you’re telling another quarterback, that your receiver — that you throw to, your receiver — that he didn’t deserve that.” “That was crazy, bro,” said McCoy, who was on that team as well. Jackson, who caught 62 passes for 1,156 yards that season, also offered his take on McNabb the person, calling him, “one of the most cheapest, richest motherf–kers you could know. … He’d make you pay for everything.” He did say they are “cool” now. McNabb may not feel the same way after the last comment. Jackson, 35, also suited up for Washington, Buccaneers, Raiders and Rams, is currently and unrestricted free agent.
