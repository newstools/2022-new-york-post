The irate customer accused of killing a Chinese-food deliveryman in an alleged dispute over duck sauce had stuffed his Queens fridge full of the sweet stuff, a high-ranking police official told The Post on Tuesday. Cops searching for guns at the Briarwood home of suspect Glenn Hirsch made the bizarre discovery, the source said. “When they were doing their search of the place for the weapons, they looked in the refrigerator, and there were all of these condiments,” the official said. “His whole fridge was filled with duck sauce. “It was not just duck sauce,” the source added. “It was condiments, duck sauce, ketchup. … It was weird. “He’s a hoarder.” Hirsch, 51, is accused of fatally shooting Zhiwen Yan, a hardworking deliveryman for the Great Wall restaurant on Queens Boulevard, on April 30 after a longstanding beef that began when Hirsch picked up an order he felt was light on duck sauce. The accused killer allegedly terrorized Great Wall workers since that November argument  and vandalized owner Ken Yang’s Lexus RV3000 a month later. The condiment-loving suspect allegedly menaced eatery workers with a gun in January, hissing, “Do you remember me?” before Yan and others tackled him to the floor, sources previously told The Post. At the time, as Hirsch was being held by the workers for cops, he allegedly asked Yan, “How’s your car?” before pledging to kill his entire family, the sources added. In April, Hirsch was seen on surveillance footage circling the restaurant in his car, then following Yan before he allegedly shot dead the married father of three in Forest Hills, cops said. The murder left Yang traumatized over the condiment. He told The Post on Sunday “I don’t want to touch it. “I can’t because it brings back bad memories,” he said.
