Oscar Pistorius, behind bars for the murder of his girlfriend, is set to meet with her father to try to gain an early prison release, according to a new report. The Sun revealed Saturday that the former Olympic sprinter — who is serving a more than 13-year sentence for killing model Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 — will “soon” speak with Barry Steenkamp in a South African legal procedure that could lead him to be released on parole. It’s unclear when the meeting is scheduled to take place. The 35-year-old South African, who has served half of his sentence, was due to also meet Reeva’s mother, June. The double-amputee Paralympic gold medalist in 2013 shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and reality-TV star, through a bathroom door inside his home in Pretoria, South Africa. The prosecution alleged that Pistorius intentionally shot his girlfriend four times after the couple had an argument on Valentine’s Day. But Pistorius claimed he woke up and fired off the bullets because he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder. Pistorius, who ran during the 2012 Olympics on carbon-fiber running blades, was initially convicted of manslaughter in 2014, but he was later found guilty of murder in the case. In late 2020, Pistorius’ longtime friend said that he was begging for her family’s forgiveness. “I want to tell them I’m sorry,” he said, according to pal Bill Schroder. A prosecutor said in 2014 that the former runner offered $34,000 to Steenkamp’s family after he killed her, but they turned it down because they did not want to accept “blood money.”
