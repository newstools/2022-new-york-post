Baker Mayfield does not sound like someone who intends to return to the Cleveland Browns. Mayfield spoke to the media at his youth football camp in Oklahoma on Tuesday. Carey Murdock, a radio host and publisher of SoonerScoop.com, asked Mayfield if a Browns reconciliation could happen – in the event Deshaun Watson receives a lengthy suspension in the wake of more than 20 allegations of sexual misconduct from massage therapists. “I think it’s been pretty obvious the mutual decision on both sides is to move on,” Mayfield answered. In response to a follow-up about a possible reconciliation, he said there would “have to be some reaching out [from the Browns’ side],” but again expressed doubt either side wants that to happen. He said he was thankful to the relationships he built with players and support staff and fans. He added there was “no resentment to the city of Cleveland.” Mayfield also expressed some aggravation that the Browns have not yet found a trade partner. “I got frustrated with it not happening before minicamp, but that’s the stuff that’s out of my control and so let those things happen and fall into place,” Mayfield said. In April, Mayfield conveyed that he felt “disrespected” by the Browns. “Yeah the respect thing is all going to be a personal thing, but yeah, I feel disrespected. One hundred percent,” Mayfield said at the time. “I was told one thing, and they completely did another. That’s what I’m in the middle of now. And you know what? OK. I got my taste of it, because I’ve had four different head coaches in four years. A bunch of different coordinators.” Elsewhere in the Browns quarterback room, veteran Jacoby Brissett joined the team this offseason. There has also been speculation that they could attempt to acquire Jimmy Garoppolo from the 49ers.
