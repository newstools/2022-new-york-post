In the latest chapter of a sad saga, former NBA player Delonte West was reportedly seen in a viral video panhandling on Richmond Highway in Alexandria, Virginia, over the weekend. West, 38, has faced a public battle with substance abuse and mental health struggles in recent years. The eight-year NBA veteran has also spoken about battling bipolar disorder. After a troubling video surfaced of a shirtless, bloody West in handcuffs in January of 2020, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban intervened to help set West up with a rehab program. Following a relapse and subsequent arrest in October, West seemed to have again gotten his feet back under him. He had resumed training in hopes of securing a spot in Ice Cube’s BIG3 3-on-3 basketball league this summer. In April, his name was added to the league’s draft pool, but he was not selected. West, known for his stints with the Mavericks, Cavaliers and Celtics, last appeared in the NBA in 2012. He played professionally through 2015.
