MINNEAPOLIS — Despite having the best record in the sport, the Yankees will look to fill some holes on the roster before MLB’s trade deadline. And with the 23-33 Cubs coming into town this weekend, fans might get a look at some potential targets. Ian Happ figures to be at the top of the list. The Yankees say they like their outfield depth and don’t mind playing Aaron Judge regularly in center. But Aaron Hicks and Joey Gallo continue to struggle, Giancarlo Stanton can only play the outfield a few days a week at most and they have Miguel Andujar and Tim Locastro in reserve at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Happ, 27, is a switch-hitter who has played in left field primarily. After slipping at the plate a bit a year ago, Happ has his OPS back up to .818 and his strikeout rate is down. He’s making $6.85 million and is not a free agent until 2024.
