This Rock, Virginia fun-fair is one of the most ghost-ridden places in the United States, according to one recent visitor. According to a 23-year-old urban explorer who goes by Kalani, the deserted pleasure ground is full of swing sets that “move on their own,” disembodied screams, chants, mysterious footsteps and plenty of other paranormal activity. “It ranks as one of the ‘most terrifying places in America’,” Kalani said following a recent visit which he documented and uploaded to his TikTok, where it has garnered over eight million views. “ The amusement park opened in 1962 and included water slides, a dancehall, a speakeasy and more but shuttered in 1966 following a series of unfortunate events, according to Kalani. “At some point things started to go bad after a little girl died on the swings and a young boy drowned in the pond. I think six visitors died during the park’s short history and it was left abandoned,” he said, Jam Press reported. The 800-acre tract of theme park was subsequently purchased by a construction company with plans to build on the plot — but the company abandoned the idea after learning the space had formerly been a Native American burial ground. “During the 1700s, the Clay family moved out [to the area] and established [a] farm. Tragedy struck the family in 1783, after a Native American tribe allegedly killed two children and burned one at the stake,” Kalani detailed. “Their father decided to retaliate with help from other nearby settlers and soon the property traded hands.” During his visit, nature was visibly reclaiming the park, the only remaining rides in which are a ferris wheel and swings. “There were no signs of damage, as the property is still managed by the family [who last purchased it],” he added.
