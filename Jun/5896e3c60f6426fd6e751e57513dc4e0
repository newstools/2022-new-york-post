The death toll in this week’s human smuggling horror climbed to 53 on Wednesday, according to the Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office. “As of this morning, a total of 53 bodies of victims are at the BCMEO,” the county said in a statement. “Forty of the victims are male and 13 are female.” The ME’s office added that 37 of the dead migrants had been potentially identified, and that the office was working with the consulates of Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to complete the IDs. While the medical examiner has yet to issue formal cause of death findings for the 53 people who died while being smuggled across the border, first responders said Monday that the survivors were hot to the touch and suffering from apparent dehydration. The truck had apparently suffered a mechanical failure when it was abandoned in the midst of a triple-digit heatwave Monday. Authorities said the truck crossed the border in Laredo, 150 miles south of San Antonio. The truck then passed through a border checkpoint on Interstate 35, said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas). It is unclear whether the migrants were in the truck when it apparently cleared the checkpoint. The place where the truck was discovered — by a railroad track — is a well-known spot for migrants to be dropped off after being smuggled across the border, Harry Jimenez, former deputy in charge of the San Antonio ICE office, told The Post on Tuesday. The truck driver, a US citizen, was apprehended by authorities in a nearby field and taken into federal custody, police said. Two other men also were arrested on weapons charges.
