The Mets pushed back Max Scherzer’s minor-league rehab start by one day, as they continue to take a cautious approach with the three-time Cy Young winner’s return from an oblique injury. Scherzer was slated to pitch Tuesday night for Double-A Binghamton at Hartford, but he instead will pitch there Wednesday night. “We all sat down and talked about it. It’s not going to affect the number of starts he might make if things go well tomorrow night, so just give him an extra day,” Buck Showalter said before Tuesday’s game against the Astros at Citi Field. “If you look at the history of this injury, he’s right where he needs to be and everything will fall according to how he does [Wednesday] night.” Showalter indicated that the 37-year-old Scherzer “thinks he could pitch here tonight, but we’re just trying to look at the history of this injury and how long it normally lasts.” Scherzer hasn’t pitched for the Mets since suffering a left oblique strain on May 18 against the Cardinals. He made his first rehab last Tuesday for Binghamton, striking out six in 3 1/3 innings against Reading. Scherzer had acknowledged Saturday that he “got a little sore” in the days after his previous outing.
