Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany Matthews are ready to add their second child to their family. Nearly a year and a half since welcoming daughter Sterling Skye Mahomes, the Mahomes family found out during a gender reveal that they’re having a baby boy in a video posted on social media on Sunday. When asked for a prediction before the reveal, Mahomes said, “It’s a guaranteed boy.” Mahomes got his wish. The gender reveal party culminated for Mahomes when he jumped into his pool in celebration. Mahomes and Matthews got married in Hawaii in March.
