He’s at it again! Britain’s Prince Louis continued to steal the show on the fourth and final day of Great-Grandmother Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee celebration of her 70 years as monarch. Louis — the youngest son of Prince William and Kate Middleton — could hardly sit still in the grandstand at Sunday’s Jubilee Pageant parade. The 4-year-old royal — whose antics earlier in the days-long celebration drew comparisons to the Saturday Night Live-spoofed antics of former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani’s son Andrew — spent much of Sunday’s parade distracting his parents and grandfather. Photos of the young regal showed him looking generally disinterested in the day’s festivities — giving a “stinky face” to his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, holding up a pillow over his head and covering both his eyes with his palms. At one point, Louis sat on his grandfather Prince Charles’ lap as the heir-apparent to the British crown pointed to the parade in an apparent attempt to grab the boy’s interest. Louis also joined his parents, siblings, grandparents and the queen herself on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the pageant-concluding rendition of “God Save the Queen.”
