New video captures the moment a gunman let off a flurry of bullets on a Bronx street – striking another man in the leg. The clip, released early Tuesday, shows the suspect approaching a group on Jerome Avenue near East 171st Street in Mount Eden around 3 a.m. June 18. The footage then cuts to the suspect pulling a gun as he stands on the sidewalk near the curb, letting off several rounds into the street. A 24-year-old man riding by on a scooter, who is not shown in the video, was struck in the right shin, police said. He went to Lincoln Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition. He was uncooperative and did not provide information to police – but investigators later determined he was the victim of the shooting, authorities said. The shooter is shown getting into a double-parked car that flees the scene. Police were still looking for the suspect Tuesday.
