Tyreek Hill said on the first episode of his new podcast that his new quarterback Tua Tagovailoa beats out Patrick Mahomes in accuracy. The newly acquired Dolphins receiver saw a taste of Tagovailoa after signing the largest wide receiver contract in NFL history this off season. After playing alongside the two franchise quarterbacks, Hill believes Mahomes tops out in arm strength but Tagovailoa has accuracy over Kansas City’s superstar QB. “I’ve had a chance to see Tua throw the ball, to myself,” Hill said on his podcast “It Needed To Be Said.” “He’s that dude, bro… What a lot of people don’t know, like, I’m not just sitting just saying this because he’s my quarterback now.” Analytics-wise, Hill’s take does check out — but only slightly. Tagovailoa has a 66.3 completion percentage, compared to Mahomes’ 66.2 percent. And during last season, the Dolphins QB threw a slightly better completion rating than Mahomes —  67.8 to 66.3 Hill previously touted his new quarterback’s arm — and the receiver added on his podcast Tagovailoa has “a heck of” one — but Mahomes threw nearly 2,000 more yards the Dolphins’ QB last season. The former NFL MVP also has started triple the amount of games than Tagovailoa, 63 to 21. So, time will only tell if Hill’s statement is truly correct. Despite being injured in the second game of this past season, Tagovailoa improved in nearly every statistical category compared to his rookie campaign. Now with a Pro Bowl receiver in Hill going into next season, Tagovailoa has a new, and better, piece to throw to on offense.
