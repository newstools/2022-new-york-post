They say that even a broken clock is right twice a day, but whoever coined that phrase clearly didn’t have the Knicks in mind. At least not while they’ve been on the clock in far too many drafts over the past couple of decades. With the NBA Finals over, it’s that time of year again for the Knicks, who presently control the No. 11 pick in Thursday night’s NBA Draft  at Barclays Center — albeit with the possibility still to make a big splash and move up as high as No. 4, according to various reports. The Warriors winning another championship last week — their fourth in eight years — shows how unlucky and/or inept the Knicks have been with many of their recent first-rounders, even if RJ Barrett looks like a potential All-Star. Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley and Quentin Grimes also showed some promise of being regular contributors last season.
