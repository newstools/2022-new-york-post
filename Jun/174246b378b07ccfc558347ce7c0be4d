Tylor Megill has landed on the injured list for the second time this season. The Mets righty has been shut down with a right shoulder strain and will be re-evaluated in four weeks, the team announced before Friday’s game against the Marlins at Citi Field. Megill underwent an MRI on Friday after leaving Thursday’s start against the Brewers in the fourth inning. “They’re gathering all of the information about what steps to take, but they know that it’s a minimum of four [weeks],” Mets manager Buck Showalter said. “I’m hoping on the 29th day that he’s throwing, but I don’t know yet. I think that would be good news. “When you’re talking about a shoulder, I gotta tell ya, I almost, when I heard the four weeks, I was actually kind of upbeat about it, when you exit with that injury. So hopefully we can get the four weeks behind us and he feels good. We’ll take some steps and see what other things we can possibly do to speed up the process.” Megill was sidelined for about four weeks beginning May 11 with biceps inflammation. He is 4-2 with a 5.01 ERA in nine starts this season, giving up six earned runs in 6 2/3 innings over two starts since returning from the IL last Friday. The Mets are already without co-aces Jacob deGrom (stress reaction in his right scapula) and Max Scherzer (oblique), who threw a three-inning, 50-pitch simulated game Thursday afternoon. Right-hander Adonis Medina was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse, while Tommy Hunter was selected to the Major League roster.
