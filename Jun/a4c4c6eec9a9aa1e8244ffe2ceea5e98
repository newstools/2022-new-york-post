If you’ve ever wanted to truly define yourself as an extrovert or an introvert, here is your chance. This optical illusion can determine if you’re one or the other by simply looking at it. The image shows a turquoise circle with a face and two birds forming a luscious mustache against a black background. Viewers should stare at the image for a short period of time to determine what figures they see first. At first glance, one may immediately see a round moon face and the two birds create the ‘stache. For those who noticed the blue moon face first, it means they are an introvert, yet a sensitive and kind person, according to India-based education web portal Jagran Josh. This person also avoids conflict and has marvelous intuition that allows them to stay out of tough issues. These people also earn from their mistakes, and this type of personality brings both strengths and challenges. These individuals are also good listeners and can hold their own in certain situations. For those who saw a glimpse of the birds at first, it indicates that these types of people are warm and fun-loving extroverted fellows. These characters are the ones who enjoy life to the fullest, are light-hearted and funny, spiritual and playful. These individuals can be friendly to other people, open-minded and pleasant to be around.
