An anonymous bidder ponied up $19 million for the right to dine with investing icon Warren Buffett for charity, eBay announced. The winning bid smashed the previous record price paid for lunch with the billionaire nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha, set by cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun in 2019. Ebay said that the $19 million price tag was the highest amount ever paid for an auction item on the site. The unidentified lunch partner will join Buffett for a swanky meal at Manhattan’s storied Smith & Wollensky steakhouse. The Omaha-native, 91, continues to serve at the helm of investing powerhouse Berkshire Hathaway, and has an estimated net worth of $93 billion. Buffett offers his company up for charity auction each year, with the proceeds going towards the San Francisco Glide non-profit that assists the homeless and other at risk groups The Power of One Charity Auction Lunch had been paused for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Buffett’s late first wife Susan, introduced him to Glide in 2004 while volunteering there and he has since raised $34 million for the organization since. The billionaire has previously told guests that all subject matter is fair game during the meal — aside from his future investing strategies.
