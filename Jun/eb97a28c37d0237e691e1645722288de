Three people were injured after a plane crashed at a children’s summer camp in North Carolina. The small plane, a Cessna 172M, went down just after 6:20  p.m. Thursday on the property of Camp Kahdalea for Girls near Rosman in Transylvania County, officials told The Transylvania Times. All three passengers on board the plane were airlifted to area hospitals for treatment. No campers or staff were injured. “This is one of those things that we don’t get that often,” Transylvania County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Chuck Owenby said. Camp officials told the paper three campers’ parents were flying over a remote area of the campsite to take pictures when the plane suddenly became unresponsive and crash landed in a wooded area. “It was far away, but one person walked away from it and told us they needed help,” Camp Director David Trufant said. Trufant said all of the passengers were conscious and talking when responders arrived at the scene. Officials said the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration would not be on scene to investigate the crash further until Friday morning.
