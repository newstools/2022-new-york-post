Beanie Feldstein and Jane Lynch will soon say goodbye to Broadway’s “Funny Girl” revival. The show’s social media accounts broke the news in a statement on Wednesday. “14 weeks left to see Beanie Feldstein & Jane Lynch now through September 25th,” it posted. “Stay tuned for additional casting news to join Ramin Karimloo & Jared Grimes and the company of Funny Girl.” The news comes after Feldstein missed several shows after testing positive for COVID-19 on June 6. The 28-year-old performer reflected on her role in her own Instagram post Wednesday. “I’ll never be able to find the words that could even begin to explain what the experience has been to me,” she wrote. “To every single person that brings Funny Girl to life on stage every day at the August Wilson – to every dresser, usher, front of house, spot operator, props, automation, to the incredible offstage company who are the heroes of Broadway, to every orchestra member, security guard, the genius hair team, my sound team buddies and of course my angels on stage with me every night … all of the people of Funny Girl: I love you. “You’re my people. I am forever changed by knowing you.” Feldstein was famously snubbed by the 2022 Tonys. In fact, the show received only a single nomination: Jared Grimes for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. However, that award went to Matt Doyle for his role in “Company.” That may have been fair, according to Post critic Johnny Oleksinski. He was less than impressed when the revival hit Broadway on April 24. Feldstein as main character Fanny Brice “is supposed to steal our hearts and sprain our funny bones. No dice,” he wrote. “Feldstein is, I’m sorry to say, not giving a Broadway-caliber performance.” The review’s only mention of Lynch described her as “adequate.” “From top to bottom, this ‘Funny Girl’ needed different people,” Oleksinski concluded.
