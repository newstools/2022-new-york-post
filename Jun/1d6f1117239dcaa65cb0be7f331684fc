A child and three adults were shot and killed in a triple murder-suicide in Florida Tuesday morning, police said. Officers and Seminole County sheriff’s deputies raced to an apartment in the 2300 block of Coawood Court in Casselberry around 7:15 a.m. after they received a 911 call from a victim saying he had been shot, reported ClickOrlando. When law enforcement officers entered the home, they found four people suffering from gunshot wounds: two women, one man and a boy. “Paramedics provided trauma care to the injured and transported at least one patient from the scene,” Casselberry police said in a statement. “Tragically, all four individuals succumbed to their injuries and are deceased.” According to investigators, the gunman shot the three victims before turning the firearm on themselves. The names of the shooter and victims have not yet been released. No information was provided about a possible motive.
