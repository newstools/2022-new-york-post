This gives Pussy Riot new meaning. A man discovered a lonely kitten on the side of the road — only to have a pack of tiny cats emerge from the brush. In a now-viral clip, the lone baby feline meows at the man where the grass meets gravel — but in the next minute, Louisiana’s Robert Brantley is ambushed by a stampede of meowing kittens. “Oh, my gosh!” he exclaims in the video, which shows a seemingly never-ending kitten rampage. “I can’t take ya’ll. Oh, my gosh.” One by one, the little kitties sprang from the tall grass that towered over their small bodies, running in circles around his feet. “There’s more — we got a kitten problem,” Brantley says in the video, clearly shocked. “I thought I was saving one. Hot diggity dog.” The 37-year-old Brantley was driving along and just happened to see what he thought was a kitten on the side of the road. After he continued on, he let the thought of the cat “marinate,” eventually deciding to turn around and rescue it before the rest of the pack suddenly surprised him. “They’re all here at the house; they’re all doing good,” he told The Post of all 13 kittens he discovered. “The first time I fed them, they fought like they had never eaten a bite of food before.” He speculated that someone probably had these kittens in their house and threw them out since he couldn’t find their mama. While he can’t keep the entire baker’s dozen, he plans to keep at least two or three for his family, including one kitten on which his 1-year-old son fixated. “They’re obsessed with each other,” he said. As far as the rest, gracious neighbors have offered to adopt them. “We had a lot of really good people that are local reach out wanting them, and a lot of people are wanting to do pairs to keep them together, which I’m pumped about,” he said, adding that he’s being careful about who he gives the precious kittens to.
