One of the fondest moments of Rafael Nadal’s run at the 2022 French Open took place off the court. Nadal, who won his 14th French Open title on Sunday, embraced wife Xisca Perello after defeating Norway’s Casper Ruud. The intimate moment between the spouses was captured on camera, with much of Twitter fawning over the sweet moment in time. “The best photo of the french open,” one fan tweeted, while another gushed, “Touching and sweet.” Tennis journalist Gaspar Ribeiro Lanca also praised the snapshot, calling it “the off-court photograph of the year, absolutely brilliant.” Prior to celebrating what would be Nadal’s 22nd grand slam title, Perello was spotted in the stands on Sunday at Roland Garros. The 36-year-old athlete also gave his family a shoutout during the trophy presentation later in the day. “I don’t know what can happen in the future,” Nadal said to the crowd, adding how he’s “going to keep fighting to try to keep going.” No matter what happens next for Nadal, professionally, Xisca will be by his side to support him. Nadal and Perello dated for 14 years before the longtime couple tied the knot in 2019, swapping vows at the La Fortaleza castle in Mallorca, Spain, in front of about 350 guests, according to The Sun. Perello serves as the project director for Nadal’s charity, the Rafa Nala Foundation, per the outlet.
