NBA free agency officially begins Thursday. Here are three players that will be on the Nets’ wishlist: This is the white whale, a restricted free agent the Nets have been linked to in a sign-and-trade involving Joe Harris and Nic Claxton. Would they sacrifice depth to chase a star, even if it’s insurance against losing Kyrie Irving? GM Sean Marks once signed the sweet-shooting wing to a max offer sheet; could he get him for a $6 million mid-level exception now? If the Nets lose Patty Mills (or deal Harris), that need becomes more acute. A young center who is versatile on both ends. There was mutual interest last year before the Nets signed Paul Millsap. Even if the Clippers can’t pay him, there will be plenty of interest around the league.
