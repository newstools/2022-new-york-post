All good things come to an end. This Rangers season was a magical one. Almost nobody expected them to be a playoff team. Nobody thought they would be two wins away from the Stanley Cup Final. This young team has a bright future ahead and will look to get to the Cup next season. They might have some new faces on the roster to try to get them there, though. To discuss the Rangers season coming to an end at the hands of the Lightning, the mysterious Kaapo Kakko scratch and dive into what free agents may stay and who may go, we bring you the season finale of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Ron Duguay and Mollie Walker. The Post’s Larry Brooks joins us a final time to weigh in on a smashing success of a season and what might happen with the roster this summer.
