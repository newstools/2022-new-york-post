These GameStop workers aren’t playing any games. A Nebraska store of the video game chain was forced to close after four employees walked out, claiming bad working conditions. The foursome left a nefarious note at the Gateway Mall in Lincoln for customers, informing them of the termination of their employment. The memo was taped to the store’s window and said: “We regret to inform you that we all quit,” according to Reddit. “Our district manager has no respect for us as employees or as human beings,” the note continued. “We have been told by our district manager that we were supposed to have had this store achieving sales quotas and running perfectly months ago. Which was months before a lot of us even got hired. Unfortunately, despite the staff’s best efforts, we are not god,” they went on. “Spend your money at an establishment that respects it’s (sic) employees,” the statement added. Former store manager Frank Maurer further elaborated on the walkout, telling Kotaku: “For my health, I had to leave.” Maurer also claimed he was expected to reach almost impossible sales goals while being paid a low wage. He alleged that his district manager was reportedly abusive toward him and Maurer didn’t receive proper store training. GameStop had another slew of employees quit in Lincoln, Nebraska, earlier this year, News.com.au reported, and another store under the same district manager shuttered its doors after a walkout. GameStop had a meteoric rise in popularity thanks to Redditors, who pushed the stock to new heights and helped raise the company’s value and sales. The highest stock price for GameStop was $483. But with any rise comes a fall, as the brand’s stocks have plummeted.
