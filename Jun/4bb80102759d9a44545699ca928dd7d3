Newlywed Jena Sims is shooting her shot with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit. The wife of golfer Brooks Koepka posted a submission video Thursday for the SI Swim Search casting call, in hopes of landing her “dream job” with the iconic publication. “Your dreams don’t chase you back! Submitting for my dream job,” Sims, 33, captioned the video on TikTok. The actress-philanthropist opened the 60-second clip by stating she’s “a firm believer in going after what you want,” referencing how she once slid into Koepka’s DMs before elaborating on why she wants to be a part of the SI Swimsuit family. “I’m a former pageant winner myself, but losing a pageant absolutely sucks. But in the grand scheme of things, there are kids that feel like they are losing at everything, and that’s exactly why I created the Pageant of Hope,” Sims said of her nonprofit, which strives to “empower, celebrate and advocate for children facing challenges,” per the organization’s website. “Helping people and spreading joy really is my passion, and I know that together, we can create even more positive impact on the world,” she continued in the TikTok video. Since sharing the video online, Sims has received support from SI Swimsuit models Kristen Louelle and Christen Harper, the latter being the girlfriend of Lions quarterback Jared Goff, who cheered her on in the comments section. Harper is a current SI Swimsuit rookie and previously submitted her own audition video for the magazine back in 2020. She recently celebrated the launch of the 2022 issue, which was released last month.
