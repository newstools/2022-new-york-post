More images from the sequel film “Avatar: The Way of Water” have been revealed, showing Kate Winslet well and truly immersed in the world of Pandora. The highly anticipated sequel to James Cameron’s 2009 film is due out at the end of the year, starring the Oscar winner as Ronal, the leader of the Metkayina, a lesser-known clan of the Na’vi tribe. Winslet told Empire magazine her character is “deeply loyal and a fearless leader.” “She is strong. A warrior,” Winslet told the publication. “Even in the face of grave danger, and with an unborn baby on board, she still joins her people and fights for what she holds most dear. Her family and their home.” Zoe Saldaña is returning to play Neytiri and Sam Worthington will reprise the role of Jake Sully, as well as Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang as Col. Miles Quaritch, according to Variety. The sequel will pick up a decade after the original with Disney’s official synopsis reading: “ ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ begins to tell the story of the Sully family, the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.” Winslet said she learned to hold her breath underwater for the role, revealing that she held it for seven minutes and 14 seconds while filming, beating Tom Cruise’s record of six minutes while filming “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.” “It was brilliant and I was very proud of myself and I’ll probably never be able to do it again,” Winslet told “Entertainment Tonight” in 2020. “That came at the end of four weeks’ worth of quite intense training and it was in the dive tank, it was in the training tank. But I loved it.” “Avatar” is the highest-grossing movie of all time at the global box office with $2.84 billion. Its sequel sees Cameron and Winslet reuniting for the first time since “Titanic,” which was released in 1997. “Avatar: The Way of Water” opens in theaters Dec. 16.
