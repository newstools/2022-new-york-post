Dozens of parked cars were left with smashed windows during an overnight seven-block Queens vandalism spree, cops said. At least one vandal smashed the windows of more than 30 parked, unoccupied vehicles on Queens Boulevard between 51st and 58th streets in Sunnyside either late Wednesday or early Thursday, cops said. It’s unclear whether anything was taken from the cars. No suspect description was available Thursday.
