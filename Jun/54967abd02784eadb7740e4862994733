While many mind-blowing optical illusions can play with your brain — such as this wild celebrity portrait — here’s one that could leave you blue in the face. [Warning: Spoilers below] The three circles in this photo seem like they are different shades of blue — but they are, in fact, all the same color. At first glance, the orb on the left looks like it’s a lighter hue of blue than the circle on the right. However, when one puts the spheres side-by-side on a white background, one can see that the circles are identical. Created by UK vision company Lenstore, the drawing is an example of the saturation optical illusion — when an object seems to change color as it travels through different backgrounds but is actually just one color. The photo is a prime standard to show the subjective and abstract way our brains understand colors. An object’s lighting and background can also affect how we perceive pictures. When the blue circle is implanted on a lighter shade of blue background, the contrast will make us think that the ball is darker than it actually is. In order to process an item’s color, our brains look to many places for visual information such as context clues. An object’s surroundings and background are a big clue to help our brains decipher a shade. If the illusion tickles your fancy, check out this one that will make your eyes do a double-take if you stare at it for too long. It may just seem like a mind-bending image of black and white stripes, but it can change if you scroll on it too rapidly.
