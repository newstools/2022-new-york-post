Odell Beckham Jr. may not pick his next team before the season starts. The wideout, who tore his ACL in the Rams’ Super Bowl victory over the Bengals, remains a free agent. Speaking on ESPN’s “Get Up” on Monday, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler said that the Rams are “optimistic” that they could bring Beckham Jr. back – but that they might be waiting awhile to see where he lands. “Beckham could take his time here,” Fowler said. “Because, talking to teams, they don’t expect Beckham to be healthy until October or maybe even November, as far as full go back from that ACL. “So, Beckham can take his time, maybe even wait until the first couple weeks of the season, and see who’s hot, who needs a receiver. He will likely go to a contender.” Beckham Jr. joined the Rams midseason last year after forcing his way out of Cleveland. The final straw with the Browns came when his father distributed a video of the wideout being open, but not having the ball delivered to him by Baker Mayfield. He had a monster performance for the Rams in the NFC Championship Game against the 49ers, catching nine balls for 113 yards. Before he got hurt in the Super Bowl, he had three catches for 52 yards and a touchdown.
