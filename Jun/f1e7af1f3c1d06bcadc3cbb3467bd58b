A 23-year-old man was stabbed in the neck in an unprovoked attack in Queens over the weekend, cops say. The victim was at the intersection of Queens Boulevard and 48th Street in Sunnyside around 3:15 a.m. Sunday when another man randomly stabbed him in the neck with an “unknown cutting instrument,” cops said. The victim was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center in serious but stable condition. Police released footage late Sunday of the suspect walking on the sidewalk wearing a light-colored T-shirt, dark-colored pants and carrying a cross-body bag. He was still being sought Monday. The incident came hours after Donny Ubiera, 32, was nabbed for two random subway slashings that took place along the No. 7 subway line in Queens, cops said. He allegedly committed those crimes days after he was picked up, then let go, for brandishing a knife at cops, law-enforcement sources said.
