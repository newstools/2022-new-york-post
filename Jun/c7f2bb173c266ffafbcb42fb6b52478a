If you like a man’s gray hair, you should tell him. A new study shows that it will probably make him feel better. A survey of 2,000 men across all generations — conducted by OnePoll and L’Oreal Paris — looked into how they deal with natural changes to their appearance that come with aging. Half of the participants currently had gray hair and 44 percent of them were self-conscious about it. That could be why 38 percent of men choose to dye their grays. An overwhelming 70 percent of participants worry that gray hair makes them look older, while 42 percent worry others will find them less attractive with silver locks. The graying process can start early — in one’s 20s, if not even sooner — but the survey found that Gen Xers and baby boomers aren’t comfortable with the aging color gray until they are nearly 50. One of the top concerns for millennials (34 percent) and Gen X men (39 percent) is going gray, which can contribute to why 45 percent of men admitted they sometimes feel pressure to look younger than they are. “As a barber and colorist, I see first-hand the impact that appearance can have on one’s confidence,” barber Rob McMillan said. “Men are often overlooked in this aspect, but in reality, they can just as impacted by women. If my clients choose to cover their grays, I always encourage them to make sure it’s coming from within and not because they feel pressured by external factors.” Despite the current fascination with silver foxes labeled “Daddy” or “DILF,” the data suggest that men, on average, feel insecure about their looks three times a week, worrying about factors like their weight and how their eyes look. Millennials feel the most self-conscious about their physical appearance (78 percent) versus 62 percent of Gen Zers and 55 percent of Gen Xers.
