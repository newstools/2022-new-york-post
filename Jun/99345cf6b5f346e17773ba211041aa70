This woman is making claims that are out of this world. Mafe Walker, 45, said that she can now speak an alien language after a trip to the ancient Teotihuacan pyramids just outside of Mexico City. In the Colombia native’s series of viral TikTok posts, she claimed that while at the pyramid site, aliens contacted her and gifted her the ability to communicate with them. Walker currently has over 300,000 TikTok followers with over 1 million likes. In her videos now, she is seen standing at various places chanting this special “language” with no explanation of why she is doing it. In her bio, she claims to be a medium for the message these extraterrestrials are trying to spread. More than a few naysayers reacted with comments such as “What people come up with in order to get famous ” and “Spewing nonsense? How is this solving anything in this world? Lol.” These doubters are convinced that Walker is the latest addition to a current trend of spiritual people claiming they can speak old biblical languages. One month after launching her account, Walker was invited on local talk show “Vega La Alegría” where she told the hosts that she had access to a “galactic portal” and began chanting just like on her TikToks on live TV. The station was convinced enough to caption her segment: “Mafe Walker speaks to us in an alien language, totally live!”
