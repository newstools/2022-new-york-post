Charles Barkley offered a message to the Nets: Make Kyrie Irving earn it. Let him show he deserves a contract extension by proving he’s all-in. “If it was me, I would say, ‘Hey, guy, we can’t trust you, what you’re going to do,’ ” Barkley, the outspoken Turner Sports analyst and Hall of Fame player, said over Zoom on Wednesday as he promoted the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament. “We’re going to pay you that $36 million next year to see if you’re going to act right. If you don’t act right with $36 millon, you definitely ain’t going to act right with $240 million. I’m not giving you a four-year extension for $200 million because we can’t count on you.” The 30-year-old Irving has until June 29 to decide whether he will opt out of the final $36.5 million year of his contract for 2022-23 and become a free agent. The Post’s Brian Lewis recently reported that an extension is most likely. Irving has appeared in just half the possible games since arriving on a max deal in 2019, missing 123 of 226 regular-season games. This year, he missed 53 regular-season games, mostly due to his refusal to adhere to New York City’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates. His part-time status didn’t help the Nets, who had a disappointing season and were swept out of the first round of the playoffs by the Celtics. Irving, however, is close friends with superstar teammate Kevin Durant and has maintained a strong relationship with team owners Joe and Clara Wu Tsai. “He’s got one year left with his option, he’s going to pick it up and we’ll see how he behaves next year,” Barkley said. At least that’s how Barkley would handle it. The Nets and Irving may go in a different direction.
