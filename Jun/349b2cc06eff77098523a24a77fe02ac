Giants legend Eli Manning gushed about his nephew taking the next step in his football career. Eli’s nephew, Arch, is a part of the generational family of Manning quarterbacks. The five-star recruit committed to University of Texas on Thursday, sending a frenzy across the college football world after his announcement. “He just wants to play football,” Eli told the NFL Network Friday. “He wants to be a great teammate.” Besides Eli, Arch also has Peyton Manning as an uncle. It’s also worthy to mention his dad and the oldest Manning brother, Cooper, was a top-ranked wide receiver in college before a spinal stenosis diagnosis cut his career short. As the next Manning quarterback, Eli said Friday he’s proud of his nephew. The two-time Super Bowl champ mentioned, too, that he once considered becoming a Longhorn himself back in the day before ending up at Ole Miss. “I’m excited for him going to Texas,” Eli said. “It’s a great university, great history of football. It’ll be fun to get down to Austin a few times.”
