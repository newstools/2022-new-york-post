New York’s powerhouse real estate broker and “Million Dollar Listing New York” star, Ryan Serhant, is expanding his footprint away from the Big Apple and into the Florida market. And his first listing there is a considerable one. For the first time ever, 355 Ocean Boulevard — the largest single-family oceanfront property in Miami — is hitting the market for a colossal $100 million. “We have bold expansion plans for SERHANT across South Florida and are excited to be making our grand entrance into the market with one of Miami’s most-coveted trophy properties,” Serhant, founder and CEO of SERHANT, told The Post. “355 Ocean … is a truly unique mega-estate offering one of the largest oceanfront lots in all of Miami and we’re proud to have our Signature division representing this nine-figure listing.” Located in the Golden Beach community and spanning over 32,000 square feet, the mansion is made up of nine bedrooms and 14.5 bathrooms. Situated on a 1.5-acre lot with 250 feet of ocean frontage, luxury amenities include a wine cellar, a home theater, a bowling alley, a spa and a gym. Additionally, there is a lounge bar, an auxiliary kitchen, two gated entrances, a poolside guest house, a 58-foot swimming pool, a grand veranda and staff quarters. “Ryan is not stepping back from NYC real estate, rather as founder and CEO of his own brokerage he is looking to expand his operation and his company,” Natalie Hernandez, a rep for Serhant, told The Post. “In addition to South Florida, earlier this year, the firm announced it would be opening a brick-and-mortar office in the Hamptons after doing business in the market out East since last summer.” “On the market for the first time in nearly 40 years, this one-of-one trophy exudes Palm Beach elegance amidst Golden Beach’s prized amenities: private beach, tennis courts, clubhouse and its own police force.” Serhant and Dina Goldentayer of Douglas Elliman hold the listing.
