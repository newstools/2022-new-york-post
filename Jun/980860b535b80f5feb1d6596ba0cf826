The Yankees and Angels were rained out on Wednesday and are scheduled to make up the game as part of a split doubleheader on Thursday in The Bronx, with the games starting at 1:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. Shohei Ohtani is slated to pitch for the Angels in one of the games, with Nestor Cortes and Jameson Taillon slated to start for the Yankees. The forecast isn’t great for Thursday evening, either, meaning the Angels may have to make another trip to Yankee Stadium later in the season. Tickets for Wednesday’s game can be used for the first game on Thursday or exchange them for tickets to another regular season game, subject to availability and the Yankees’ rain check policy.
