A woman has shared how she sometimes lies that she’s pregnant as she’s fed up with other people assuming that that is the case. Daphne Colson, who describes herself as a “mid-size cowgirl” on her TikTok profile @daphnecolson, revealed how she’s come to the conclusion that she should use her weight to her advantage. In a video posted to the social media site, Daphne posed for the camera and told her followers: “Something about me is if a stranger asks if I’m pregnant I’m saying yes regardless. Do I need a seat? Yes please. Do I want to skip to the front of the line? Absolutely.” The American woman continued: “Would I like an extra dessert? You’d better believe it. “If y’all are gonna have no boundaries with fat people I’m gonna use it to my advantage.” She also added in the caption for the post, which has been liked over 25,000 times: “We’re turning fat phobia to pregnancy privilege besties.” Daphne added a string of hashtags at the end, including #plussizeproblems #midsizequeens and #plussizetiktok. As Daphne’s followers said they didn’t blame her and would do the same thing, she thanked them for their support. However, she was also targeted by trolls who accused her of “taking advantage.” One social media user said: “If you’re not pregnant don’t lie and take advantage. Simple as. “This then puts real pregnant women in a negative position.” After spotting the comment, Daphne replied, showing she wasn’t letting it get to her. She wrote: “It’s really not that deep bestie.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
