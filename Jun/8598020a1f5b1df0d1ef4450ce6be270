In gearing up for summer, there’s a host of products to add to your shopping cart. But today, we’re giving all the love and attention to beach carts. We know what you’re thinking: If I’m only going to the beach for a day trip, why do I need a larger-than-life cart? Well, here’s why. Those beach days add up, and you need a centralized wheeler to carry your beach chairs, a quality umbrella and some odds and ends (like bikinis, oversized sunglasses and cover-ups). With a quick add-to-cart action, you’ll be thanking yourself for this practical, convenience-bringing essential that everyone will be asking about. Ahead, we pulled the 12 best ones to keep you locked and loaded during these warmer temps. From Amazon to Walmart, you’re sure to find your next go-to. As an Amazon’s Choice selection, Mac Sports’ Heavy-Duty Collapsible Beach Wagon Cart has industrial-looking wheels, a roomy interior and nearly 3K beach-goers who back it up. It holds up to 150 pounds and even has two built-in mesh cup holders to keep your beverages secure. Much like its prized selection of beach chairs, Tommy Bahama has a roll-on-over cart that’s waiting for you to store it in your trunk. Speaking of beach chairs, it can hold up to four of them, has ergonomic tread wheels for easy traction and is embossed with a teal and royal palm print that screams summertime. For a brand that makes high-quality power tools (including tool boxes and kits), Black+Decker offers a Collapsible Utility Wagon that’s waiting for your next beach trip. It features all-terrain wheels, an ergonomic handle and a quick-fold and easy-transport design, most notably. As a leading splurge-worthy name as far as beach carts go, Wheeleez has a supreme wheelbarrow-esque model to snag on Amazon. If the vibrant green color doesn’t sell you, its durable, high-powered wheels will. Designed for any type of use, Rio’s Wonder Wheeler Plus is a relatively affordable option that does the job of carrying it all. From its two large rear wheels to its mesh make (to easily see beach essentials and groceries), you’ll thank us later. What’s better than a beach cart? One with a hooded canopy of course! This well-designed roller has an incredible amount of storage compartments — including cup holders — and the canopy can be removed. Plus, it comes in royal blue for the same price. If you’re keen on fishing (perhaps with some of the best fishing rods we rounded up this year), then you’ll love Vevor’s Beach Fishing Cart. Its aluminum alloy make coupled with its capacity to hold up to 500 pounds (oh, and its well-crafted wheels) make this a fine buy. Add a touch of summertime color to your beach wagon with Greenfamily’s model. A standout for having large wheels and a multipurpose design (which serves well for gardening), you’ll want to add it to your cart for less than $150. What’s great about Mac Sports’ Utility Wagon isn’t just its coveted collapsible functionality. Its extra storage space at the bottom — which looks like a serving tray — comes in handy for easy-grab items like your sunscreen. Plus, it’s durable and can hold up to 150 pounds. Specially designed with sand wheels, Quest’s Beach Wagon is difficult to pass up. It folds for simple storage and transportation, has extra-large cup holders and can hold up to 225 pounds with a single trolley down the beach path. We love Huckberry’s Tupelo Heavy-Duty Wagon for its sky-blue color but also for its powder-coated metal frame that’s built to last. Its nylon fabric is also abrasion-resistant, too, so you know you’re getting quality and convenience with this model. If you’re on the market for a compact beach cart, RollX’s Big Balloon Wheel Beach Cart is your best bet. Though affixed with an oversized wheel, it’s the perfect wheel-around tool for beach trips and vacations. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
