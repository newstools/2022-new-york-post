This would never happen with Warriors fans — except for the video that shows otherwise. Boston Celtics fans spared few words as they rained expletives down on Draymond Green and the Warriors during Game 3 of the NBA Finals. After “Draymond sucks” and “F–k you Draymond” chants echoed through TD Garden during the Celtics’ 116-100 rout of the Warriors, Green’s teammates and family members swiftly called out the offensive home crowd. “We’ve played in front of rude people before, dropping F-bombs with children in the crowd,” Klay Thompson said following the game. “Real classy, good job Boston.” Green’s wife, Hazel Renee, couldn’t believe the “very disgusting” behavior she witnessed from Celtics fans while she and her two children were sitting amongst them in the stands. “Tough loss tonight BUT in NO WAY, shape or form should fans be allowed to chant obscenities at players!” Renee wrote on her Instagram story. “Are they not human? Is someone standing at your job saying off the wall things to you?” The rowdy fan behavior should be an all too familiar sight for the Warriors, whose fanbase is notorious for heckling the opposing team. In a resurfaced video from Game 2 of the 2015 NBA Finals at Oracle Arena, a disgruntled Warriors fan can be heard asking Lebron James to his face, “How’s it feel to be a p–sy ass bitch?” A security guard promptly tells the woman to watch her mouth as James glares in her direction. Warning: Graphic Language Perhaps the Warriors should take a look in the mirror before they criticize another fan base. They’ll look to push through the noise and even the series at two apiece when they return to what should be a raucous TD Garden Arena on Friday night.
