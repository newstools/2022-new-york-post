Mets owner Steve Cohen can at least see the humor in Francisco Lindor’s bizarre finger injury. Lindor is sitting out Thursday’s series opener against the Dodgers in Los Angeles after injuring his finger in a hotel door. “Lin-door just got hurt by a door,” Cohen tweeted, “Ironic.” According to manager Buck Showalter, the hot-hitting Lindor got his middle finger caught in a double door on Wednesday night and the swelling was affecting his throwing more than his batting. “They closed at the same time and the next thing you know I got a swollen finger,” Lindor told reporters. “I ran around the room for like three minutes. I didn’t want to look at it. I felt like I had my heart in that finger.” It’s a blessing in disguise for Showalter, at least. “Actually I have been looking for a day to give him, so maybe that is a blessing in disguise,” Showalter said in his pregame media session. “But he’s kind of disappointed, obviously, he wanted to play tonight.” The Mets can afford to give their superstar the night off to recuperate — even if he’s in the midst of a 10-game RBI streak and is batting .324 over his past 18 games. The NL East-leading Amazins’ entered the Dodgers series with a 10.5 game lead over the second-place Braves.
