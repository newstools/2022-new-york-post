Game 1 of the NHL Western Conference Finals between the Edmonton Oilers and Colorado Avalanche was off the rails. The two teams combined for 14 goals, 84 shots and 37 high-danger scoring chances on Tuesday night, with Colorado coming out ahead, 8-6, though one goal was scored via the empty net. Both teams used two goalies and Colorado’s starter, Darcy Kuemper, is doubtful for Game 2 on Thursday night. Considering how the series opener played out, it’s no surprise that bookmakers have bumped up the total for Game 2. If the Over/Under closes at 7.5, it will be the first time a Stanley Cup playoff game closes with an O/U above 7 since 2004. While we might not see another 14-goal thriller on Thursday night, it would be a bit of a stunner if the two teams decide to shell up in Game 2. Another wide-open contest is to be expected and while that would usually spell trouble against the Avalanche, who are built to play in that type of environment, the Oilers are one of a few teams that can hang with Colorado in a back-and-forth contest. Despite trailing by four goals at one point in Game 1, the Oilers never looked outclassed and were able to put Colorado on its heels for large chunks of the game, especially in the third period. With Colorado’s goaltending situation looking precarious, the Oilers have value in what should be another chaotic game Thursday night. Odds courtesy of BetMGM
