Tigers pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez has been placed on the restricted list because of a marital issue, according to sources, and there’s no date yet for his return. Rodriguez appeared set to return to the mound from a rib injury when the marital issue arose, and the team granted his request to take time to attend to the private matter. The Tigers have not said anything publicly about Rodriguez’s absence beyond a statement saying it is related to “personal matters.” It was learned that personal matter is marriage related. Rodriguez, 29, will not be paid while on the restricted list. The left-hander was to make $14 million this season his newly signed five-year, $77 million free-agent contract. He would lose about $400,000 per start missed. The Tigers would love to get him back as soon as possible, but it’s believed they have no knowledge of when he may return. Rodriguez is 1-3 with a 4.38 ERA in eight starts in his first season in Detroit after seven years with the Red Sox. Tigers general manager Al Avila declined comment. Rodriguez’s agent, Gene Mato, also declined to discuss the matter.
