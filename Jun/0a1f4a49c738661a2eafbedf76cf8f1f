Service at LaGuardia Airport was closer to normal Saturday as roughly 1 in 10 flights were grounded – a big improvement over the previous two days when mass cancellations plagued the facility. As of 3:30 pm, 33 or 10% of the scheduled flights out of the Queens hub had been canceled and another 38 were delayed, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com. Despite fielding many gripes from inconvenienced passengers, service was still a big improvement. On Thursday, more than a third of all flights at the airport were canceled in one of the worst travel days yet this summer — and the chaos spilled over into Friday, which saw 19% of flights axed and another 24% with delays by late afternoon mostly because of stormy weather. The metropolitan area’s two other main airports, JFK in Queens and Newark Liberty International, also saw significant improvements Saturday following days of delays. At LaGuardia, passengers on Saturday were still fuming over sporadic service by many airline carriers. Melina Carrillo, 36, said her Delta Airlines flight to Toronto was cancelled three times. She said Delta didn’t offer her and her significant other assistance beyond putting them on a later flight — not even a food voucher. “There’s not even have a comfortable seat here to wait more than two hours,” she said. “I definitely won’t be using Delta or LaGuardia in the future.” A man named “Denny,” who wouldn’t provide his last name, said the delays caused him to miss a family event in Calgary on Friday and was planning to fly there Saturday night. He also said Delta didn’t offer him any food or hotel vouchers. “People who fly often, we understand that you can’t avoid the weather. If it’s a hurricane or a big storm, that’s just something you need to deal with, but Delta should be able to manage the fallout of it,” he said. “It seemed like all the workers didn’t even want to be here.”
