The NFL will hold a disciplinary hearing for Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson starting Tuesday, ESPN reported. Watson, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of massage therapists, will have his hearing before Sue L. Robinson, a disciplinary officer for both the NFL and the NFL Players Association. The three-time Pro Bowler has been hit with 24 civil lawsuits and has settled 20 of them. The NFL is expected to pursue a “lengthy” suspension for Watson, who will be defended by the NFLPA, ESPN reported. The league is hoping to get a decision on the case before late July, when teams begin their training camps. When or if discipline is put in place, Watson, who was acquired from the Houston Texans in a March trade, will have the option to appeal. Watson inked a fully guaranteed five-year $230 million dollar deal with Cleveland following the trade. Robinson, who has never ruled on any NFL player cases, was a member of Delaware’s district court for more than 25 years.
