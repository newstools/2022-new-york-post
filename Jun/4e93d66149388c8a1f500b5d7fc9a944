Having an unusual name can be tough when you are stuck with it for life. One woman claims her parents called her Cartier Dior Eliasen but she turned it around to her advantage in her career. TikTok user @parisiancowgirl uploaded a video revealing her unusual moniker. She said: “My mom naming me Cartier Dior. “Me becoming a fashion designer in Paris.” Cartier added in the caption: “im convinced my life is a scripted tv show and this is reason number one.” The naming is certainly fitting for someone working in fashion – given Cartier and Dior are two of the biggest luxury brands. The video has racked up over 300,000 views, and many people loved her name. One person said: “She made you the main character.” Another added: “Mama manifested your future.” However, some people were quick to point out that her name could hinder her chances in the industry. One person said: “But now you can’t name your brand after you.” Another added: “Literally couldn’t think of a worse name as a fashion designer….Your named after 2 brads that already exist like no hunny.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
