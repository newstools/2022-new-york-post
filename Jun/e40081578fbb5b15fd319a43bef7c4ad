The clock is ticking towards Kyrie Irving’s Wednesday deadline to opt in or out of his Nets contract. With more and more signals pointing towards an exit from Brooklyn, there’s one man who may be ready to take the chance on Irving. LeBron James and the Lakers may be the sole suitor for Kyrie Irving and his talents. Irving is trying to push his way to the Lakers, and The Athletic reported, that while the dynamic could be delicate, James is very open to having Irving join the Lakers. Last month, on the “I Am Athlete” podcast, Irving attempted to clear the air about the pair’s supposed “beef” that revolved around Irving forcing a trade from the Cavaliers to the Celtics in the 2017 offseason. “Bron was like, behind the scenes…what’s his nickname that people call him? LeGM?” Irving said. “He put the squad together. I wasn’t mad at him. I was like, ‘Alright, this is how it goes.’” Irving also stated that he and James “didn’t talk during that time,” referring to the time after his exit from Cleveland, but emphasized the media’s involvement in worsening the situation. Irving claimed that the news of his trade request leaked before he could speak to James and that helped cause the tension. “So I go over to China, and I’m on my Nike tour, and somehow the news gets leaked while I’m in China,” Irving said. “So I can’t even get on (social media) to defend myself.” There are many obstacles to getting Irving to the Lakers, namely that there is no trade package the Nets find enticing with Los Angeles. A creative three-team sign-and-trade would have to be worked out. Or, if Irving is truly desperate, Bleacher Report noted he is increasingly likely to decline his player option and sign with the Lakers for the $6 million mid-level exception.
