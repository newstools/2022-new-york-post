Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, says she looks forward to testifying before the January 6 House Select Committee and setting the record straight about her efforts to help overturn the 2020 presidential election. “I can’t wait to clear up misconceptions. I look forward to talking to them,” Thomas told the Daily Caller. She declined to elaborate about what misconceptions she believed the committee held. The longtime conservative activist has come under growing scrutiny over texts sent to then-President Trump’s Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other Trump supporters after he lost the election to Joe Biden. “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!” Thomas wrote in Nov. 10, 2020, according to the Washington Post. “You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” Thomas also corresponded with John Eastman, an attorney who was deeply involved in Trump’s campaign to reverse the results of the election and stay in power despite losing both the popular and Electoral College votes. “We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee,” Committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi) told Axios. “We have discovered in those Eastman [emails] some information that refers to Ginni Thomas.” Her involvement in the bogus effort has prompted Democrats to demand that Clarence Thomas recuse himself from any cases involving Trump’s efforts to challenge the election.
