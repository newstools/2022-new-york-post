A woman was put in a chokehold and stabbed in the back in a random attack in a Lower Manhattan subway stop early Friday, cops said. The incident unfolded just before 5 a.m. as the 19-year-old was walking down the stairs at the Delancey Street/Essex Street station when she was attacked from behind, cops said. The unknown attacker took off topside and cops are still searching for the man. The woman was taken to Lenox Health Greenwich Village hospital for bruises to her neck and a stab wound, according to police. She is expected to recover.
