It was a classic Rafael Nadal performance in more ways than one for John McEnroe. The Tennis legend vented over Nadal taking his time serving in Tuesday’s quarterfinals of the 2022 French Open, which saw Nadal defeat Novak Djokovic in a four-set thriller, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6. McEnroe, who has previously complained about Nadal’s timing, suggested during his Eurosport commentary that the Spaniard “should be penalized” for violating the shot clock. “If you are going to do it, do it, otherwise don’t bother. It is like humoring everyone,” said a  frustrated McEnroe. “It’s a joke! He takes a look at the clock again … one. He’s edging it, isn’t he? Shouldn’t they have it at 15 seconds on the second serve? 10? Something? “Or don’t bother. It’s like, you can take as much time as you want on the second serve. How long is this game? 12 minutes? Jeez.” Nadal eventually received a time violation in the second set but did not appear to acknowledge the penalty or the umpire. Nadal is known for his leisurely routine on the court in between serves, which has led to a number of time violations for disregarding the 25-second countdown. The 35-year-old’s routine typically includes placing his hair behind his ear, pulling on his nose, and adjusting his shorts before bouncing the ball numerous times on the court. “Rafa has got his ritual that takes 30 seconds every time he plays a point,” McEnroe said of Nadal last month in an interview with Insider. “If you’re that great you can get away with it. “That’s one of the incentives of being the best — you get away with more, as evidenced by what I did at times on the court and what he does, in a totally classier way, though. Obviously, he’s not out there screaming at people or anything.” Nadal topped Djokovic early Wednesday at Court Philippe-Chatrier in their 59th meeting. He will now face No. 3 seed, Alexander Zverev, in the French Open semi-finals on Friday.
