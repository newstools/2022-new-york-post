Russell Wilson is a big fan of his wife Ciara’s new twerk-filled video. On Thursday, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star, 36, posted a short clip on social media to hype up her new song, “J.U.M.P.” The video features Ciara twerking on top of a Ford Bronco truck, which naturally caught the attention of Denver’s new quarterback. In the comments section of Ciara’s Instagram post, Wilson, 33, dropped a series of fire emojis, along with the hashtag “JUMP.” Beyond Wilson, Ciara’s 31.9 million followers also had positive reactions to the sultry video, which features the “Level Up” singer dancing out of the sunroof. “Its time to pull up and make that thang J.U.M.P ,” she captioned the clip. Ciara isn’t the only member of her family starring in new hype videos. Wilson, who has been married to the singer since 2016, was busy this week modeling his new Broncos jersey, telling fans of the team, “Let’s ride,” in a clip posted on Twitter. Though Wilson is gearing up for his first season in Denver, after being traded by the Seattle Seahawks in March, he’s also living it up in his new surroundings. This week, Wilson and Broncos receiver Jerry Jeudy watched Game 2 of the NHL’s Western Conference Finals, when the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Edmonton Oilers, 4-0. Ciara was also at the game, in addition to daughter Sienna, 5, and son Future, whom she shares with her ex, rapper Future. Since relocating to Denver this offseason, Wilson and Ciara have made efforts to involve their family in the Colorado community.
