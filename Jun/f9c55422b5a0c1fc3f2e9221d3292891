Russell Westbrook was dancing on the day he opted into his contract with the Lakers. The veteran point guard belted out the lyrics to Beyoncé’s song, “Break My Soul,” in a Twitter video he shared on Tuesday — just before ESPN reported Westbrook is planning to exercise his $47.1 million option to return to the Lakers for the 2022-2023 season. Westbrook’s agent, Thad Foucher at Wasserman’s basketball division, is planning to file the paperwork on Tuesday. The former league MVP has a Wednesday deadline on his option. Westbrook sang the lyrics, “You won’t break my soul / I’m telling everybody” in the video, which also came after he got into a Twitter spat with Skip Bayless over the weekend. Westbrook is entering the final season of his original five-year, $206 million contract. The 33-year-old point guard is coming off a disastrous debut season with the Lakers, with his shooting woes reaching frightening levels. Westbrook averaged 18.5 points in 78 games last season — his lowest output since the 2009-10 season — while also posting a career-worst 15.0 PER (player efficiency rating). Westbrook was traded from the Wizards to the Lakers to form a Big 3 with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the duo that led the Lakers to a 17th title in the 2020 NBA bubble. But the trio only played a total of just 21 games together due in part to injuries, and Westbrook had tension with coach Frank Vogel, who was fired after the season. Westbrook blamed Vogel for his struggles, stating that he believed the coach had an issue with him and that the two “never really connected.” The Lakers have since hired former Bucks assistant Darvin Ham, who expressed confidence in Westbrook.
