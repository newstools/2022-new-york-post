One of Elon Musk’s children has allegedly filed to change their name to distance themselves from their father, according to reports. A screenshot shared on Twitter by @KnowNothingTV shows legal documents filed in Los Angeles County for a petition to change a name. TMZ reported that the legal documents, which are also in recognition of a change of gender and issuance of birth certificate, were filed on behalf of 18-year-old Xavier Musk, the name she was given at birth. The official reason given is stated as: “Gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” TMZ also reported that her full name will be Vivian Jenna Wilson, taking her mother’s last name, and that “she wants to be recognized as female.” The petition was reportedly filed in April, not long after Vivian turned 18, according to Yahoo! Entertainment. Musk has seven children: Griffin, Vivian, Kai, Saxon, Damian, whom he had with Canadian author Justine Wilson, who were married from 2000 to 2008, and X AE A-XI and Exa Dark Sideræl, whom he shares with singer Grimes.
