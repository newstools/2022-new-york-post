The Denver Broncos started the NFL offseason by changing quarterbacks. Now, they have a new owner, too. The Broncos announced Tuesday night that they had entered an agreement with Rob Walton, the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, and his Walton-Penner Group, which is headlined by his daughter Carrie Walton Penner and son-in-law Greg Penner. Several sources confirmed the sale would be for $4.65 billion, which would be the largest sale of a professional sports team in American history by far. The previous record was in 2020, when Steve Cohen bought the Mets for $2.4 billion. The sale is subject to a vote among the rest of NFL owners, but the deal is expected to go off without a hitch, according to ESPN. Both Walton and Broncos CEO Joe Ellis released statements after the sale was agreed upon. “We are thrilled to be selected to move forward with the purchase of the Denver Broncos!” Walton’s statement read. “Carrie, Greg and I are inspired by the opportunity to steward this great organization in a vibrant community full of opportunity and passionate fans. Having lived and worked in Colorado, we’ve always admired the Broncos. Our enthusiasm has only grown as we’ve learned more about the team, staff and Broncos Country over the last few months.” “While this purchase and sale agreement is pending approval from the NFL’s finance committee and league ownership, today marks a significant step on the path to an exciting new chapter in Broncos history,” Ellis’ statement said. It’s expected to be an exciting season ahead, after the team traded several first-round draft picks to the Seattle Seahawks for quarterback Russell Wilson. Barring anything unforseen, there will be a new group watching Wilson from the owner’s box.
