Hot. Hot. Hot. The Yankees and Phillies have won nine of their last 10. It was 103 degrees in Dallas, Texas, on Sunday. Chicago fans are so hot they started chanting “Fire Tony” at White Sox manager Tony La Russa. There is the new Taco Bell Flamin’ Loco Taco, and your favorite handicapper is en fuego, winning 24 of his last 28. And there are the World Series champion Braves. Hotlanta has won 11 in a row and are in D.C., taking on the Nationals. Sharp last year, the Braves’ Ian Anderson (5-3, 4.53) has been dull. He’s won his last two starts (the Bravos bats bailing him out) but allowed seven runs over 12 innings. While the Nats get swatted nightly, Josiah Gray (6-4, 4.33) has won two of his last three, limiting opponents to two runs over 16 total innings. Play 10 units on Hotlanta. Smokin! Ross Stripling pitched a one-hitter over six, Vlad Guerrero Jr. homered, Lourdes Gurriel knocked in three runs, and the Jays blanked the Tigers, 6-0. Up +1,164 jalapenos.
