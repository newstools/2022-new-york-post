Three men were shot Sunday morning — one fatally — by a gunman firing what appeared to be an assault rifle during a dispute outside a Queens catering hall, cops said. Video obtained by The Post shows the man firing the weapon around 5 a.m. in the parking lot of the business at Cross Bay Boulevard and Desarc Road in Ozone Park, cops said. A 38-year-old man was taken to Jamaica Hospital in critical condition and later died, cops said. A 32-year-old man went to the same hospital by private means with a gunshot wound to the face, police said. He was expected to survive. A 28-year-old man walked into Kings County Hospital with multiple gunshot wounds to the leg and was in stable condition, according to cops. There were no immediate arrests.
