A Vermont man was caught on camera wildly swinging an excavator at two state troopers who were trying to take his son into custody. The troopers had gone to Wayne Tallman’s home in Hardwick earlier this month to arrest his 24-year-old son, Brandon Tallman, in relation to an assault and burglary case, police said. As the troopers were trying to cuff the son, Tallman allegedly jumped behind the controls of the excavator and set it in motion. Dashcam footage from June 12 showed the dad repeatedly swinging the excavator’s bucket towards the troopers as they wrestled with Brandon on the driveway. The troopers could be seen trying to dodge the machinery as they pinned Brandon to the ground. “They don’t have a scenario at the academy where we practice this one,” a Vermont State Police commander said in the wake of the ordeal. At one point, the troopers could be seen pointing at Tallman as they ordered him out of the excavator. Eventually, Tallman relented and he was arrested for aggravated assault on a protected official, resisting arrest, impeding and reckless endangerment. Tallman’s wife, Amy, had also intervened by trying to pull the troopers off her son, police said. She was issued a citation for impeding an officer.
