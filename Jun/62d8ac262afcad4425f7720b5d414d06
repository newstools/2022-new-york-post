Wild video captures the moment a gunman opened fire in broad daylight, striking a 21-year-old man in Brooklyn. The gunman was arguing with the victim around 2:20 p.m. June 4 on Williams Avenue near Riverdale Avenue in New Lots when the dispute turned violent, authorities said late Wednesday. Footage shows the suspect sprinting down the block, with his arm outstretched, opening fire. His target was struck in the thigh and taken to Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition. The suspect is then shown darting into a building down the block. Investigators are still looking to track him down. He is described as approximately in his 20s, with a dark complexion and slim build, last seen wearing a white T-shirt, blue shorts, light-colored sneakers and white socks. He also carried a dark bag across his chest.
