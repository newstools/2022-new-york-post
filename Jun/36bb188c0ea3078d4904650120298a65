Comedian and actor Colin Jost has officially closed a big chapter with the sale of his longtime Manhattan pad. Jost, the 39-year-old “Saturday Night Live” mainstay who has lived in this West Village duplex since 2011, sold it for $2.32 million last week, The Post has learned. Made up of two bedrooms and two bathrooms, Jost — who grew up on Staten Island and attended Harvard University — initially hoped to score $2.5 million for the co-op. The move to sell the residence, where the comedian lived as he established his “SNL” career, comes after he welcomed his first child with wife, Scarlett Johansson, last August. Spanning over 1,400 square feet, the home comes with a private patio and a private garden. What’s more: The garden even comes with a pre-wired projector screen. Through the home’s foyer is the main living area, which features an exposed brick wall, a woodburning fireplace and French doors that lead to a Juliet balcony overlooking the garden. Adjacent to the living room is a petite windowed kitchen, accented with painted yellow cabinets. On the same floor is the second bedroom with shuttered windows and an exposed tub. According to the previous listing, the tub is out in the open for “ultimate relaxation.” On the lower floor is the primary bedroom suite with an ensuite bathroom that comes with a large linen closet, an overhead rain shower and a walk-in closet. Noble Black and David Son of Douglas Elliman held the listing. Meanwhile, Jost and Johansson, who married in October 2020, have been touring new potential homes for their growing family, including a sprawling $23 million Upper East Side penthouse last month, The Post first reported. Johansson, 37, herself recently sold her longtime penthouse as well, but at a loss. The home had been on the market since 2019. Between the two of them, they own six other properties, including two homes in the Hamptons. Johansson also owns homes in Los Angeles and the celeb-favored Snedens Landing, N.Y.
