Bullets flew near a popular Manhattan tourist spot in broad daylight Thursday, striking a COVID-19 vaccination bus and prompting lockdowns at two nearby schools, cops said. The gunfire struck the occupied city vaccination bus that was parked at 18th Street and Ninth Avenue in Chelsea around 2 p.m., cops said. The New York City Lab School for Collaborative Studies and Hudson High School of Learning Technologies were both put on a lockdown that was later lifted, police said. Three suspects were taken into custody at the scene, according to police. Charges were pending. There were no injuries. The shooting occurred about a block from the city’s popular High Line tourist attraction.
