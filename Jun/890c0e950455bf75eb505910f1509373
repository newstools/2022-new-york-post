Days after he was seen panhandling on Richmond Highway in Alexandria, Va., former NBA player Delonte West was spotted loitering outside a 7-Eleven. In the video, West can be seen conversing with several passers-by as well as standing atop an ice cooler to plug his phone into an electrical outlet. The 38-year-old has struggled with substance abuse, mental health issues and a bipolar disorder in recent years. West, who spent eight years in the NBA, which included stints with the Celtics, Mavericks and Cavaliers, had resumed training in February in hopes of securing a spot in Ice Cube’s Big 3 3-on-3 basketball league. But he reportedly “no-showed” for the league’s draft last month. A former first-round pick by the Celtics in 2004, West first began to draw concern when in February 2016 he was photographed barefoot and in a hospital gown out in public in Houston. That June, a video of him panhandling in Maryland went viral. Then in January 2020, a disconcerting video surfaced of a shirtless and bloody West on a Maryland sidewalk following an apparent fight. In the incident’s aftermath, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban helped set up West, who last played in the NBA in 2012, in a rehab program. But in October of last year West relapsed and was arrested outside a Florida police department.
