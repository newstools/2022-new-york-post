Mangia, the popular Italian fast-casual eatery and market, will jump from 50 W. 57th St., where it’s been since 1981, to Williams Equities’ 57 W 57th St. across the street. Mangia will have 9,500 square feet at the Sixth Avenue corner, including 3,000 sf on the ground where the asking rent was $200 per square foot. The remaining space will be on the lower level for Mangia’s catering facility. Williams principal Michael T. Cohen said Mangia will be a “perfect  complement to Quality Italian,” the steakhouse in the building. Colliers International’s Zach Nathan, David Green and Brad Mendelson repped the landlord. Current Real Estate Advisors’ Adam Henick and Jennifer Bernstein repped Mangia.
