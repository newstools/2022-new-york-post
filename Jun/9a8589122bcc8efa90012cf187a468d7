The owners of the beloved restaurant LoLo’s Seafood Shack in Harlem, Leticia Skai Young-Mohan and Raymond Mohan, have put their Harlem townhouse on the market for $2.49 million. (The couple, known for feeding people in need during the pandemic, are also gearing up to open a new restaurant — LoLo’s on Broadway.) The legal four-family, four-story townhouse at 14 E. 130th St. was built in 1900. It’s currently set up as a three-unit property: a ground-floor duplex with access to the garden — particularly beloved by the couple’s dog, a Shiba Inu named Dali, as in Salvador — and a Jacuzzi hot tub off the main bedroom. There are also two large one-bedroom floor-through apartments with bay windows. Sixteen feet wide, the townhouse also features original details, such as crown moldings, fireplace mantels and stained glass. The couple bought it in 2014 for $1 million. Leticia, born and raised in Harlem, tells Gimme that the garden is one of her favorite things about the home —  and that she and Raymond will even throw in a small dinner party from her restaurant for the buyer. “This isn’t our first home. We sold two properties prior to this one, with one in Williamsburg,” said Young-Mohan. “I love our huge magical backyard where we host our friends and family. Chef Raymond has created a perfect oasis and rustic outdoor kitchen for our eclectic dinner soirées where chefs from all over the world have visited.” The listing brokers are Traci Byers and Scottie Cabrera, of Brown Harris Stevens.
