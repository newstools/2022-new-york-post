When you’re organizing a get-together, there’s not always a chance to prepare sides that are as exciting as whatever’s in the oven or on the grill. Sure you could throw something together, but you want your guests to be excited about what you serve them, and there isn’t always time to make another great dish. If you want a ready-made appetizer that’s suitable for outdoor parties or even camping, you should serve SeaBear’s 6-Pack Ready to Eat Sampler with Recipe Booklet on sale for $40 (Reg. $52). These fully-cooked seafood delights are pre-packaged and ready to eat. It can take quite a while to get a smoked sockeye just right, or you could tear open a package and have it on a cracker in seconds. Each six-pack sampler comes with servings of sockeye, smoked sockeye, pink, lemon pepper pink, smoked Idaho trout, and smoked Atlantic Bellies. All of them are delicious and a great source of protein if you want a fast healthy snack while you’re out enjoying nature.

Great addition to cheese plate or for appetizer. Love that it’s high in omega 3s and switches up salmon from baked or broiled,” says one Amazon reviewer. All you have to do is open one of the portable, no-refrigeration containers and serve. The fish is moist, and there’s no skin or bones to worry about. Serve it next to a nice white wine and enjoy the company of friends outside.
