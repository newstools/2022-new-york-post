Giancarlo Stanton’s feats of Statcast added another level to the Yankees’ victory Saturday night. As part of the Yankees’ six-homer outburst in an 8-0 win over the Cubs, Stanton clubbed the loudest — a 119.8 mph shot off the bat that registered as the hardest-hit ball in MLB this season, according to Statcast. “We all just kind of look at each other, he gets back and I’m like, ‘You’re weird,’ ” manager Aaron Boone said. “Unicorn. He’s weird.” Stanton clobbered the ball so hard it caromed off a sign on the second deck and landed back in left field. The blast was the hardest hit in the majors since last September, when Stanton drilled a 120.3 mph single. “I caught how hard it was, but it’s still only worth one and just helped us add to the win,” Stanton said. “I don’t always know what it feels like, to be honest. … It’s a cool little euphoric feeling.” During the Statcast era (since 2015), there have been just 17 hits with an exit velocity of at least 119.8 mph. Stanton owns 14 of them, while teammate Aaron Judge is responsible for the other three. “It’s quite a sight,” Judge said. “You try to soak it all in in the moment, because when he hits one like that, you don’t see that every day.”
