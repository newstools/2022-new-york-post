New Yorkers headed to the polls Tuesday to vote in the primary contests for governor, lieutenant governor and state Assembly. In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Gov. Kathy Hochul is attempting to fend off a pair of challengers to earn a full term in office – Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Nassau). On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-Suffolk), former White House staffer Andrew Giuliani, businessman Harry Wilson, and former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino are competing in what has shaped up to be a “free-for-all” contest for the GOP nomination.
