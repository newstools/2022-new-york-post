Frank Gore, the third-leading rusher in NFL history who is also known for his toughness, durability and most of all longevity, is signing a one-day contract with with the 49ers, then calling it a career. Over his 16 seasons in the NFL, Gore rushed for 16,000 yards, had 484 catches for 3,985 yards and scored 100 touchdowns after being drafted out of Miami by San Francisco in the third round round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He also played for the Colts, Dolphins, Bills and Jets and was selected to five Pro Bowls in his career. Only Emmitt Smith (18,355 yards) and Walter Payton (16,726 yards) rushed for more yards than Gore, who turned 39 last month and was an unsigned free agent before inking the ceremonial deal with the 49ers. With the news, San Francisco also announced today that Gore will be inducted into its Hall of Fame. There’s little question that Gore will also end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, too. Over the course of his career, the running back who has played in more games – 241 –than any other player at his position was a model of consistency. Gore posted the most consecutive seasons with 1,200-plus yards from scrimmage in NFL history with 12. “I want to say thank you to the faithful,” Gore said in a video shared by the 49ers. “Y’all have been with me since I got drafted. The whole 10 year — my whole career, 16 years, even when I went to other teams. I see my social media, y’all talk, y’all root for me. I  appreciate y’all and I love y’all. Thank y’all for everything.” Gore is also the 49ers’ franchise leader in career rushing yards (11,703) and touchdowns (64). His 13,956 yards from scrimmage rank behind only Hall-of-Fame receiver Jerry Rice in franchise history.
