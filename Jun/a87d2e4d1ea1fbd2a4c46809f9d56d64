A parent blasted a school’s new head after she sent a text insisting girls in skirts wear black tights for “modesty and decency purposes”. The mom, whose daughter is a pupil, said the “sexist” wording suggested girls were being immodest and indecent by not wearing them. She added that the black tights demand did not conform to the official uniform policy at Longfield Academy, Darlington, County Durham. The official uniform policy on the school’s website says: “If tights are worn, they must be plain and not patterned,” implying that wearing them is not mandatory. Head Angela Sweeten said a formal consultation exercise over uniform was ongoing at the 891-pupil secondary school. She added: “Over the course of the last few weeks there has been a number of informal conversations regarding school uniforms.” “This has led me to write to parents/carers on Friday, June 24 to begin a formal consultation exercise.” “The process will also involve input from pupils and staff.” “Any changes to the policy will be communicated to the school community prior to the summer holiday.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
