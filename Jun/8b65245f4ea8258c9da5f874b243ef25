The Los Angeles home of one of Hollywood’s classic directors has hit the market for $19.99 million. The Ernst Lubitsch Estate — built in Bel-Air for the Berlin-born producer, writer and actor of the same name — was last listed more than six decades ago. The five-bedroom, eight-bathroom property has been featured in numerous lists of LA’s greatest properties over the years and is steeped in old-world charm beyond its history and into its foundation. “It’s a time warp in the best of ways,” Douglas Elliman agent Josh Flagg, who holds the 9,292-square-foot listing, told The Post. “Everybody drives by and wonders what’s up there, because you can’t see it from the street — this is the first time it’s been seen in many years.” Despite its mysterious reputation, since being constructed in 1934 the house and grounds have hosted countless dignitaries, kings, presidents and entertainers. “Legends like Garbo, Colbert, Rathbone, Gaynor, Lang, Marlene Dietrich graced the guest book,” advertised a 1999 Bel-Air Association Estate Tour of the property. The home, which was “inspired by the white-washed brickworks of Mexico,” has five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and eight wood-burning fireplaces. The three-time Oscar-nominated director, who passed away in 1947, had the home built with exposed beams, red-tile floors, oversize bricks and hand-smoothed white plaster walls. Many of the original details remain intact. Set up a private drive on slightly over an acre of greenery, the main house also includes a primary suite with a balcony, a walk-in closet and dressing room — and a lower-level cantina for entertaining. “Steps away” from the primary property is a separate casita. Outdoor highlights include a “massive swimming pool, vegetable gardens, and expansive outdoor loggias,” according to the listing. The sellers are a married couple known for hosting charity functions attended by European nobility and globetrotting. They’ve occupied the house for the past 62 years.
