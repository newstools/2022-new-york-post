The estranged wife of Homero Zamorano, the accused driver of the Texas truck where 53 migrants died in a botched smuggling run, told The Post Wednesday that he was “a good man.” “I’m in shock, I mean, I just don’t even know what to say about it,” Jennifer Duncan said in an exclusive interview with The Post. “I know he wouldn’t do anything if he knew it was gonna harm anybody.” Zamorano was arrested Monday night when authorities nabbed him in a field outside San Antonio, close to the truck full of dead and dying migrants. “He was very high on meth … and had to be taken to the hospital,” a law enforcement official told the San Antonio Express-News on Wednesday. Zamorano tried to pass himself off as a migrant when he was captured, according to Mexico’s Vanguardia newspaper. But Zamorano was caught on camera, smiling from behind the wheel of the truck as it passed through a US Border Patrol checkpoint in Encinal, Texas, just before 3 p.m. Monday, Mexican officials said. The gruesome disaster is one of the worst instances of migrant deaths in recent history. When law enforcement officers entered the trailer, they found bodies stacked on top of each other and a handful of survivors suffering severe heatstroke. Duncan said she hadn’t spoken with Zamorano in some time, and that the two had split about six months ago. But she defended her husband. “He is a good man, you know,” she said, sobbing. “He goes out of his way to help anybody and everybody.” Zamorano is expected to be charged but remained in the hospital Wednesday.
