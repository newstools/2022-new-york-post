This 25-foot-wide, six-story townhouse is where Kieran Culkin’s character, Roman Roy, lived while plotting his family power moves and machinations on HBO’s buzzy “Succession.” In reality, Culkin, 39 — the little brother of “Home Alone” star Macaulay — was kicking up his feet in a one-bedroom apartment in the East Village he’s had since age 19 with his wife, Jazz Charton, and their daughter, Kinsey Sioux. (They’ve since had a second child, a son named Wilder Wolf.) This screen-famous townhouse is in Chelsea, at 357 W. 17th St. — and it’s back on the market for $25 million. Its past pricing has been all over the map. The seller — who was then repped by the current listing broker, Douglas Elliman’s Lila Nejad — bought it for $14.99 million in July 2020. At the time, it asked $17.99 million — down from its original $38.6 million in 2016. Lady Gaga even toured it in 2018, when it was asking $29.5 million, Gimme reported. Its former owner, the flashy designer Karim Rashid, sold it for $9.35 million in 2014. At 11,000 square feet, the townhouse comes with five bedrooms and a full suite of luxe amenities. There’s a home theater, a private glass-enclosed garage, an indoor resistance pool, a sauna, a wine cellar and roughly 2,000 square feet of outdoor space. Other details include a custom fireplace, Italian doors with Swarovski crystal handles, wet bars with hidden sinks, floor-to-ceiling windows and a rooftop Jacuzzi. The first floor boasts ceilings that are almost 13 feet high, while the second floor houses a statement gourmet kitchen. The third floor, built for entertaining, includes a formal dining room open to the kitchen below. The fourth floor is a full-floor main bedroom suite, while the fifth floor features a library/home office with a private terrace. The crowning landscaped roof deck, with the hot tub, has views of the Empire State Building.
