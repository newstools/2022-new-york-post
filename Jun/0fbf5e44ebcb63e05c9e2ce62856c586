A Philadelphia woman had her face burned off after being set on fire in a gruesome park attack, police said. Alyssa Morales, 36, remains in a medically induced coma after suffering second- and third-degree burns on over 60% of her body last Thursday night. “She’s going to live, but she’ll have permanent damage,” her heartbroken mother, Leah Ann Morales, told CBS3. “She’s going to have to have a new face. I’m saying it, she’ll never have the face she was born with, and they said that’s the hard part when she can look in the mirror and see a different face looking back at her.” Morales was in too much pain to identity herself when she was first rushed to hospital — and had to be listed as a Jane Doe for two days before her family was alerted, according to a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. Fire crews discovered the severely burned woman after they were called to put out a blaze in Harrowgate Park at about 11:30 p.m. Police, who have since launched an aggravated assault investigation, said Morales was set alight after getting into a fight with a man and woman. Witnesses told cops they saw the woman throw some kind of liquid at the victim and then set her on fire. Morales was homeless and had battled with drug addiction, her mother said. “She never hurt anybody, just herself. She’s just an addict, misguided. She went to college and she just fell into that hole, and can’t climb out,” the mom said. “I’m sad, I’m broken, I’m angry, so angry,” she added. “I just want to know who did this … Who could possibly do it?”
