New couple alert? Seahawks receiver DK Metcalf and singer Normani were photographed grabbing dinner together at celebrity hotspot Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, Calif., this week. Metcalf and Normani arrived separately at the luxurious Italian eatery, but left together in the same car, according to HollywoodLife. Normani, 26, wore a little black dress for the outing, while the 24-year-old Pro Bowler rocked jeans and a T-shirt, along with a pink jacket that featured a variety of NBA team logos. Although Metcalf and Normani are believed to be single, the status of their relationship is unclear. As for Metcalf’s professional life, the wideout was a no-show at Seattle’s mandatory minicamp last week and was reportedly not excused by the team. He is currently recovering from offseason foot surgery after the Seahawks traded quarterback Russell Wilson to the Broncos in a March blockbuster. Metcalf, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, is awaiting a new deal for 2023. The receiver said in May that he expects a new contract, and both sides are “in a good place.” The Seahawks selected Metcalf in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft. The Ole Miss product went on to set a franchise record with 1,303 yards receiving in 2020.
