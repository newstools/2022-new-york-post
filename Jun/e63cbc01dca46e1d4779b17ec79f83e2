The FBI arrested Ryan Kelley, a Republican candidate for governor in Michigan, on misdemeanor charges connected to his participation in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol Riot. Kelley, 40, was arrested after law enforcement raided his Allendale Township home. He will appear in court later Thursday. His arrest comes the same day as the first primetime hearing held by the House select committee investigating the riot and approximately two months before he is expected to appear on the primary ballot seeking to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The hearing is expected to feature a mix of in-person witnesses testifying about the events and pre-recorded content, including promises of never-before-seen photos and video from Jan. 6. While Kelley has not been accused of entering the Capitol building itself on the day of the violent demonstration, court documents feature photos of the Republican on the steps wearing sunglasses and a black baseball cap. The photos also show Kelley providing support to another protester who was lifting a metal barricade as well as waving to other demonstrators to come closer to the stairs. The feds accuse the gubernatorial candidate of disruptive conduct, injuring public property and entering a restricted space without permission. Kelley now joins more than 800 people who are facing criminal charges connected to the violence that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. So far, over 300 people have pleaded guilty, according to the Associated Press.
