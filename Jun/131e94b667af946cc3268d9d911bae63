Quote of the week. President Joe Biden. “Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world. “The world. The world! Millions of Americans have better jobs, better pay. Since I took office, families are carrying less debt and have more savings than they ever had.” Somebody’s gotta tell him. The Yanks, unbeatable in The Bronx, play in Toronto. Jordan Montgomery pitches Friday. Jordan showed the Cubs the full Monty in his last outing, blanking Chicago for seven innings. The Jays go with Ross Stripling. Ross has been boss since rejoining the rotation, allowing just two hits over 11 innings while winning both games. Flying with the Blue Jays for 10 units. Let the good times roll! Nomar Mazara hit a two-run homer, Joe Musgrove pitched seven innings to push his record to 8-0, and the Padres clubbed the Cubs, 6-4. Win pushes our account to a season high +1,364 johnnygrubbs.
