The Islanders made the first big move of Lane Lambert’s coaching tenure on Thursday, firing assistant coaches John Gruden and Jim Hiller. That means Lambert has three assistant coaching spots to fill — the third spot being the associate coach title he held prior to being promoted — with director of goaltending Mitch Korn and goaltending coach Piero Greco’s statuses yet to be announced. Gruden had been with the Islanders since the beginning of Barry Trotz’s tenure as coach in 2018, Hiller was hired in 2019, though neither had extensive connections with Trotz prior to working with him in New York. General manager Lou Lamoriello had left the status of both coaches up in the air when he announced Lambert’s hiring, saying only that they were still under contract at that time. But a few weeks later, he’s seemingly decided that the Islanders would benefit from a change. Lamoriello made the surprising decision to fire Trotz and promote Lambert after a disastrous season, in which the team finished 37-35-10 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018. The Islanders’ season went off the rails early, as they suffered a COVID-19 outbreak upon returning home from a five-week road trip as they waited for construction to finish at UBS Arena. On top of the coaching change, Lamoriello has made reference to looking for “hockey trades” this offseason as the Islanders look to add more firepower.
