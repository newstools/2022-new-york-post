A Subway worker in Atlanta was shot dead and another was injured after an angry customer opened fire because they put too much mayonnaise on his sandwich, police said. The shooting erupted at the Subway in a downtown Atlanta gas station at about 6.30 p.m. Sunday after the customer became irate over his order, police said. The store’s owner, Willie Glenn, told FOX5 that mayo was to blame for the deadly argument. “Believe it or not, it was about too much mayonnaise on his sandwich,” Glenn said. “He decided to escalate the situation and from there that’s when all hell broke loose.” The manager on duty was able to return fire but didn’t strike the gunman, Glenn added. Police said they are still searching for the suspect and are reviewing surveillance footage to try to track him down. The employee who was injured, a woman, had to be rushed to a hospital for surgery, according to the owner and police. Glenn said the son of the woman was also inside the store at the time. “She had a young son that had to witness all of this,” he said. The names of the victims haven’t been released publicly, but Glenn said they were model employees who had only been on the job for less than a month. “I don’t know what the world is coming to especially with our youth. They seem to be so hot-headed,” the store owner said. “Everybody wants to carry a gun. Everybody wants to scare somebody with a gun. It’s scary out here.”
