A crew of young suspects mugged a 14-year-old boy at gunpoint in Brooklyn Bridge Park over the weekend — and crowded around to film the violent ordeal, new video shows. The teen was at Pier 2 within Brooklyn Bridge Park around 7:50 p.m. Saturday when the group approached him, cops said. The mob pushed him to the ground, punched him in the face and put a gun to his head before snatching his cellphone, hat, debit card, ID cards — and even his sneakers, police said. Footage released late Wednesday shows the group crowding around the victim — who appears to be on the ground in a tree-lined area, behind a row of boulders. One suspect is shown pointing a blue gun at him. The rest of the action is blocked by the group standing in the frame, holding up their phones. The teen refused medical attention, police said. At least some members of the group are believed to have known the young victim, cops said. Police were still looking for them Thursday.
