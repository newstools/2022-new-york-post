Chicago Bears linebacker Matt Adams was arrested Thursday night after being found in possession of firearms, high-capacity magazines, and metal-piercing ammunition. Police found the cache while searching a car reported to be stolen. They recovered a weapon along with high-capacity magazines, possession of which is a municipal code violation within Chicago city limits. On Friday, the Bears said they were aware of the 26-year-old’s arrest. “Earlier this morning, we were made aware of an incident involving the arrest of Bears linebacker Matthew Adams,” the team said in a statement. “We are in the process of gathering more information. We will refrain from making any further comment at this time.” The fifth-year linebacker is preparing for his first season in Chicago. He spent the first four years of his career with the Indianapolis Colts, where new Bears coach, Matt Eberflus, was his defensive coordinator. Adams’ arrest marks the second Chicago player to be arrested this offseason. In April, wide receiver Byron Pringle was arrested for reckless driving on a suspended license.
