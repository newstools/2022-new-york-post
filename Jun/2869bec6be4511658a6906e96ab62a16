Draymond Green’s speech at the Warriors’ championship parade on Monday could not have ended any differently. Earlier in the day, Green had quipped about how he might as well skip the San Francisco celebration if there were no speeches. Lo and behold, he found himself with a live microphone. The Golden State forward concluded his turn to speak with a succinct message to Warriors fans: “Thank you all, and it’s always f–k everybody else.” Green spoke at the parade for a couple minutes, joking that he was going to try “to think of the most controversial thing I can say — like the media” does. He said that it has been an “amazing year” and that this was a season in which, unlike past championship campaigns, everything had to break right and the teammates all had to be “aligned” to win his fourth NBA championship with the Warriors. Warning: Graphic language “What you appreciate about the journey is the people that you go through it with,” Green said. “What brings me the most joy — I know everyone thinks it’s talking s–t — after the first NBA championship is seeing the guys who won it the first time. In your journey, you always want that first-time feeling back. The reality is you never get it again, and the only way to get it again is to feel it through Andrew Wiggins, Jordan Poole, Otto Porter, Belly [Nemanja Bjelica], Moses [Moody], GP [Gary Payton II] … you feel it through those guys and that’s how you get that sensation again.”
