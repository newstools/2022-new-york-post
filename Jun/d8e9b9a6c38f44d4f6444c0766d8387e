A man who pistol-whipped and shot a woman who refused his sexual advances in a Bronx apartment building was sentenced Friday to 14 years in prison, prosecutors said. Kevin Hawse, 47, received the sentenced after a jury found him guilty of second-degree attempted murder and criminal weapons possession last month, according to the Bronx District Attorney’s office. Hawse lashed out at the victim on March 4, 2019, after she spurned his advances at a Baychester apartment building, officials said. The Union, New Jersey man dragged the unidentified woman out of an apartment by the hair before hitting her in the head with a gun and shooting her in the chest, prosecutors said. The bullet went through her body and into a wall at the Hutchinson River Parkway building, according to police. The victim was treated at Lincoln Hospital and Hawse fled to  Los Angeles, where cops tracked him down nearly two months later. “The defendant was told by the victim that she wasn’t interested in his advances. For saying no, she was grabbed, hit in the face with a gun, and shot in the chest,” Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said in a statement. “For the defendant’s violent and reprehensible actions, he will be heading to prison.”
