A comic book vendor stabbed a man during a fight outside of Macy’s in Herald Square on Friday evening, cops said. The vendor, a man in his 50s, got into a dispute with another 21-year-old man that led to a scuffle at 7th Avenue and 34th Street around 7 p.m., according to police. The 21-year-old man was transported to Bellevue Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, cops said. It’s not immediately clear what led to the dispute. Both men were arrested in the incident, according to police. Photos from the scene show the blood-stained sidewalk outside of the iconic department store. Investigators can be seen collecting evidence near a table filled with scores of comic books behind tape.
