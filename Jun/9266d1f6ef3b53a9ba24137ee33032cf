It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Rugby New York beat the Seattle Seawolves to capture the Major League Rugby title. I know; I could not contain myself either. No parade plans yet, but stay tuned. Our joy was short-lived as the New Jersey Generals were eliminated by the Philadelphia Stars. We will try to move forward. Anyone who can name any player from either team will receive a free season’s pass for both next year. If there is a next year. The Rangers are in Kansas City, and I haven’t been this excited since “Downton Abbey: A New Era” was released. The Astros are going to win the AL West. The race is for second, and the Rangers may complete the exacta. Martin Perez (5-2, 1.96) hasn’t lost a game since April. The Royals’ Kris Bubic (1-4, 7.41) picked up his first win of the year in his last start. Play 10 units on the Rangers. Wow! The Dodgers scored twice in the ninth inning to tie the game, then twice in the eleventh to win it 5-3 over the Bravos. W takes us to +1,422 ralphbrancas.
