Goldman Sachs plans to stage its second-ever conference for small-business owners next month after a pandemic-induced hiatus, with guests including Warren Buffett, Gwyneth Paltrow and MIchael Bloomberg. Other big names at the summit will include Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon, Phoenix Suns point guard Chris Paul, fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff and Washington lawmakers including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC). The event is expected to draw nearly 2,500 attendees to the Gaylord National Resort outside Washington DC on July 19 and 20, according to the bank. Goldman is better known for its presence on Wall Street — where it rakes in billions in fees from big-name corporate clients. But since the financial crisis, the bank has tried to position itself as an ally for small business. The bank’s 10,000 Small Business initiative, which began in 2009, has donated $750 million to 12,800 small businesses across the US. Speakers like billionaire Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett and GOOP founder Paltrow will address issues facing small business owners today including operating in a post-COVID world, according to the event’s organizers. The last small business summit — which also included Warren Buffett as well as Richard Branson, Tyler Perry, and Sara Blakely — was convened under Lloyd Blankfein’s watch in 2018. “Given the challenging market situation we want to convene our small business community we want to help educate and advocate for them,” a spokeswoman for Goldman told The Post. “Driving inclusive growth starts with supporting small businesses and providing them with the tools they need to create jobs and power our economy,” Solomon noted in a statement about the event.
