A few of the parents of top prospects took Twitter by storm on Thursday during the first round of the 2022 NBA Draft, but perhaps none more so than the mother of former Kansas guard, Christian Braun. Braun, who was selected 21st overall by the Nuggets, embraced his family inside the Barclays Center upon learning his NBA fate, with the cameras — and social media — getting a glimpse of his biggest fan, mom Lisa. “Twitter is WILD with Christian Braun’s mom,” one fan remarked, while another tweeted, “Christian Braun’s mom wins the draft.” As Braun’s mom became a talking point across social media, a family member (Owen Gish) reacted to a story about her becoming the draft’s breakout star, to which her apparent Twitter account replied, “You know O.” Cameras captured Braun, a 6-foot-6 athlete who played three seasons for the Jayhawks, hugging Lisa, who was clad in a red dress for her son’s big night. Basketball has long been part of Braun’s family, as Lisa played at Missouri and her husband, Don, played at St. Louis University. Braun, who is one of three siblings, takes most after his mother, according to Don. “I think anybody who saw her play back in the day knows that toughness is how he was raised,” Don told Kansas affiliate WIBW in March. “I don’t think anybody who plays for [Kansas coach] Bill Self is not on the floor unless they’re tough.” Lisa expressed how “ecstatic” she was to see Braun “grow and improve.” “This is what you always want for your kid or any athlete,” she said. “And I think that the team as a whole have done that. I think that he has done his job and his diligence to make a difference in the team and to improve at his skill level.” Braun averaged 14.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists during his junior season when the Jayhawks won the national championship.
