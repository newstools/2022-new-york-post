Jaden Ivey and his longtime girlfriend, Caitlyn Newton, are excited to begin their next chapter in Detroit. Newton joined Ivey and his family on Thursday for the 2022 NBA Draft in Brooklyn and was one of the first people he turned to after the Purdue product was selected No. 5 overall by the Pistons. An emotional Ivey later greeted commissioner Adam Silver on stage to commemorate the moment as the Barclays Center erupted into applause. “Incredibly proud of my love! Detroit, here we come,” Newton gushed Friday on Instagram. In the post, Newton and Ivey are seen sporting Pistons hats as they smile beside one another. “Our next chapter of life, can’t wait ,” Ivey wrote in the comments of Newton’s post, while the Pistons’ account added, “We can’t wait for y’all to come to the 313! .” Ivey also reshared Newton’s post on his own Instagram Story, writing Friday, “To da D baby, I love you.” Newton, who starred on Purdue’s volleyball team, was also seen wearing a diamond ring in the new photographs. The couple has yet to publicly address whether or not they are engaged, though. Ivey, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 17.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists.
