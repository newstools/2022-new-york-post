Before the pivotal fifth game of the NBA Finals tips off tonight in San Francisco, Brandon Anderson of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The Warriors, led by a 43-point performance by Stephen Curry, captured game four in Boston to level the series at two games apiece. However, Anderson believes the Celtics are primed to steal the fifth game of the series tonight in the bay. “The Celtics are nearly unbeatable after a loss,” Anderson explains. “Since January 29th, they are 12-1 both straight up and against the spread after a loss.” Just in the play-offs, the Celtics are a perfect 7-0 straight up and ATS following a loss and are covering by 13.5 points/game in those seven contests. Further, the Celtics are 8-0 against the spread on the road after a loss. On the flip-side, the Warriors have proven lackluster in games immediately following a victory. So far this post-season, Golden State is only 3-5 straight up and 2-6 against the spread in eight games immediately following a win. Plus, dating back to 2015, when the Warriors are shorter than a five-point home favorite, it is only 2-5 straight up and 2-5 against the spread. For Anderson, those trends tell him not to overreact to Curry’s game four performance and to back the Celtics to get back to its winning ways. As a result, his best bet for Monday’s contest is the Celtics Moneyline at +140.
