Two of the jurors who acquitted a former Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer dismissed the case brought by special counsel John Durham as no big deal after delivering Tuesday’s not-guilty verdict in the nation’s Democrat-heavy capital. “There are bigger things that affect the nation than a possible lie to the FBI,” the jury forewoman said, according to the Washington Times. The leader of the anonymous jury, who declined to give her name, also said that the government “could have spent our time more wisely,” according to the Washington Post. “Personally, I don’t think it should have been prosecuted,” she added. Another member of the seven-woman, five-man panel also told the Washington Post that “everyone pretty much saw it the same way” in the jury room. Lawyer Michael Sussmann, 57, was charged with lying to the FBI on Sept. 19, 2016, by allegedly denying that he was acting on behalf of Clinton’s campaign when he handed over since-debunked data that purportedly tied rival candidate Donald Trump to Russia. The forewoman said that “politics were not a factor” in the verdict, which followed about 5-1/2 hours of deliberations over two days. Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 14 to 1 in Washington, and three prospective jurors revealed during the selection process that they donated money to Clinton’s 2016 campaign, with one also saying she supported US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). It’s unclear if any of them were picked for the jury. Sussmann’s trial was the first to result from Durham’s three-year probe of Trump-Russia investigations conducted by the FBI and former special counsel Robert Mueller.
