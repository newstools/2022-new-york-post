A Las Vegas woman guzzled five shots of hard liquor before plowing into an SUV — killing a man and critically injuring his young son, prosecutors reportedly said. Lisa Guerino, 38, allegedly drove her Jeep Grand Cherokee through a stop sign at 4 a.m. Wednesday in Sin City after downing the drinks at Jackpot Joanie’s casino, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. “She had five shots of Patron,” Clark County prosecutor Shanon Clowers told a judge, the report said. “We have the receipt for it. She lived in the neighborhood. She was seen walking from the vehicle.” A passenger in the compact Volkswagen SUV, Stephens Palmatier Jr., 37, of Las Vegas, died at the scene. Palmatier’s 3-year-old son was rushed to a hospital in critical condition, while two others inside the family’s Volkswagen, including a 6-year-old girl, had minor injuries, police said. Cops later caught up with Guerino at her nearby home after she fled the crash scene. She initially claimed she was in bed at the time of the deadly wreck, Clowers reportedly said. “The length she went to, the steps she took to evade capture, it is significant,” Justice of the Peace Elana Lee Graham reportedly said of Guerino Thursday. The judge cited a police account alleging Guerino was caught on surveillance footage at the casino while imbibing, the newspaper reported. The results of Guerino’s blood test were not detailed Thursday, but the Clark County Public Defender’s Office said the screening didn’t place until four hours later. Guerino is facing charges including two counts of DUI causing death of substantial bodily harm. Graham set her bail at $100,000 and ordered her not to drive if she’s released, the Review-Journal reported. She remained in custody Friday at the Clark County Detention Center, online record show.
