It’s not what you’d call a lucky catch. Anglers Richard Kesar and Jon Loop reeled in a little more than expected last Sunday. While on the Ohio River near Lawrenceburg, Indiana, they landed a catfish that Kesar later realized had consumed a questionable meal: a sex toy. The men, both from Shelbyville, were stoked that Loop had caught his first blue catfish — and thought nothing of the fact that the fish had a few lumps throughout its midsection, according to Kesar. “We noticed when we got it in the boat that its stomach was huge,” Kesar told Fox affiliate WTTV-TV after sharing a June 5 post on Facebook — including graphic images of the dildo dinner — that went viral with more than 19,000 shares on the platform. “It’s common to find other fish, sometimes turtles, muskrats and other animals,” he explained. Only when he began to clean the fish did he realize why the fish was so bloated: A phallic object was protruding from its gut. They also saw that the fish had consumed a ball. “We noticed the stomach was hard but didn’t expect this to come out of it,” he told Facebook followers. “We decided to cut it open, and we found the foam ball, part of a fish and the other object,” Kesar recounted for WTTV-TV viewers — in a polite reference to the dildo. “I have no idea how or why it ended up in the river,” he added. Kesar confessed that his 3-year-old daughter had been helping him prep the fish when he unveiled its raunchy contents — prompting his significant other to take quick action. “When it came out, Jon, my wife and I started laughing. My wife immediately covered my daughter’s eyes and turned her away from it,” he said.
