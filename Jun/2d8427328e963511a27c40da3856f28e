A suspect has been identified in last week’s triple slaying of a Queens family — and police said the wanted man is the estranged boyfriend of the murdered mother. The NYPD on Wednesday released a photo of Travis Blake, 29, and asked for the public’s help in locating the suspected killer. Blake had been dating 55-year-old Darlene Barnett and had stopped at her South Jamaica home to “pick up his property,” victim Vashawnna Malcolm told her brother over the phone last Wednesday, police and sources said. Barnett, her son Dervon Brightly, 36, and Malcom were found dead in their house two days later, their bodies already decomposing in the summer heat, according to police. Malcolm, 22, was Barnett’s niece and had been visiting from the nation of Jamaica, sources said. She was found in a second floor bedroom bound and gagged with tape and had been stabbed multiple stab times, according to sources. Her aunt and cousin’s bodies were found in the 155th Street house’s locked basement riddled with stab wounds and trauma.
