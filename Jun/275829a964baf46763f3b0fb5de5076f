The Celtics and Warriors face off in a pivotal Game 5 matchup on Monday night with the NBA Finals tied 2-2. The Warriors are 3.5-home favorites with the total set at 212. This has been a hotly contested series so far and I expect that to continue on Monday. Instead of betting the side or total, I’m looking at a player prop: Klay Thompson Over 3.5 3-pointers made. Thompson hasn’t had a monster series scoring-wise, averaging 17.2 points through four games. It makes sense. The Celtics were the best defensive team in the NBA during the regular season and they have the Defensive Player of the Year, Marcus Smart, out on the perimeter pestering Thompson and Stephen Curry. However, Thompson is still getting a lot of looks from beyond the arc. He’s averaging 9.5 3-point attempts in the series but that number has increased to 11.5 over the last two games. Thompson has gone over this total in both of those contests, connecting on four and five attempts from long range. Overall, Thompson has 34 shot attempts in the last two games. He’s scored over 20 points just once in the series but it feels like we’re on the cusp of a big offensive game from Thompson. With the Warriors returning home and Smart likely to spend a lot of his time defending Curry, look for Thompson to go over 3.5 3-pointers made for the third straight game. The play: Thompson Over 3.5 3-pointers (+100)
