Before Game 6 of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors tips off tonight in Boston (9:00 p.m. ET, ABC), Joe Dellera of The Action Network is here to share his two favorite player props (video above). Both players Dellera is backing come from the Celtics, with point guard Marcus Smart first up on the list. Here are the picks for tonight’s win-or-go-home Game 6: For Smart, Dellera is taking the Oklahoma State product over 15.5 points (-125, BetMGM). In a win-or-go home situation for the Celtics, Dellera believes that Smart will become more of a scorer and continue to build on one specific trend. “After a loss, [Smart] is averaging 21.8 points/game and has scored 18 or more in all six of those playoff games,” Dellera says. That includes Boston’s Game 5 performance in San Francisco, in which Smart scored 20 points in what proved the Celtics’s second straight defeat. Plus, even if you consider games in which Boston’s coming off a victory against the Warriors, Smart has cleared this number in all but one game this series, including three straight. Dellera also observes that the Warriors seem comfortable letting Smart get on the board, a further reason to back his points prop tonight. For his second prop bet, Dellera is backing Celtics guard Derrick White under 1.5 three-pointers made (-113, FanDuel) Although White started off hot against the Warriors, recent games have seen his minutes drop. Plus, Dellera explains that – as the series has gone on – White’s attempts from beyond-the-arc have dropped as well. “After taking eight [three-pointers] in the first game, [White] has taken four, three, five and three [three-pointers] in the subsequent games,” Dellera says. Further, White is not particularly prolific from deep as he’s only shooting 32.1 percent from distance in the playoffs after shooting only 31 percent in the regular season. As a result, Dellera is confident White won’t be much of a factor from three-point land in a pivotal game.
