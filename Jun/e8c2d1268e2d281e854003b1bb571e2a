It was an empty night for the locals. College stars Julian Champagnie of St. John’s, Ron Harper Jr. of Rutgers and Jared Rhoden of Seton Hall all went undrafted. Moments after the NBA draft ended, however, Champagnie had agreed to terms with the 76ers on a two-way contract, a league source told The Post. ESPN reported that Harper — the son of five-time NBA champion Ron Harper — agreed to a two-way contract with the Raptors. Players who sign two-way contracts spend the bulk of the year in the G-League and can make up to 50 appearances for their NBA team during the regular season. Each team is allowed two players on two-way deals. Champagnie follows the path of his twin brother Justin, who went undrafted last year but immediately signed a two-way contract and appeared in 36 games with the Raptors. “I’m an underdog, and that’s OK,” the 6-foot-8 Champagnie told The Post the week leading up to the draft. “I’m just looking for an opportunity. Give me an opportunity and I’ll make the most of it.” The only player from the area drafted was Westchester County’s AJ Griffin, who went 16th overall to the Hawks. He became the first Archbishop Stepinac alum taken in the first round. St. John’s wing Aaron Wheeler signed a contract with the Heat to attend summer league, according to a source.
