SugarHouse’s fantastic sign-up offer means new players do not need a bonus code. New customers can claim a first deposit match up to $250 for both sportsbook and casino by following the links below. The maximum bonus amount you can earn with the SugarHouse promo code may not dazzle like some of their competitors, many of whom offer deposit matches up to $1,000 or even $2,000. However, it’s arguably one of the best new customer bonuses around, for casino players in particular, because there are minimal wagering requirements attached to the bonus amount. Many of the casinos offering deposit matches into the thousands will require you to play through your bonus funds several times before you can withdraw any associated winnings. Wagering requirements of 30-40 times are average, and higher multiples are far from unusual. SugarHouse only requires you to play through your bonus funds at the casino once, making their offer one of the best around for simplicity and the likelihood of making a profit on your bonus. The SugarHouse name comes after the SugarHouse Casino (now Rivers Casino) built-in Philadelphia was erected on the site of the former Jack Frost Sugar Refinery. The Casino was built in the early 2000s, and it was not until 2016 when SugarHouse Casino moved online. New Jersey was the first state to launch and remains the only state to date. A soft launch was conducted in Pennsylvania, but the testing period lasted just two days. One of the primary reasons slots are so popular at online casino sites is that they give you the best bang for your buck. Whether you are playing to try and win some serious money or just for pure entertainment, high-tempo online slot games always deliver. With SugarHouse Casino having over 350 slots to choose from, with different jackpots and prizes, selecting the best ones can be difficult. All of the slots at SugarHouse Casino have a decent Return to Player (RTP) percentage. An RTP of around 96% is the average for SugarHouse Casino, strong amongst competitors. For a brand of SugarHouse’s size, their table games are surprisingly disappointing. There are just two varieties of blackjack titles and a handful more roulette variations. Video Poker, on the other hand, is very impressive at SugarHouse Casino, as SugarHouse has kept up with the pace and is regularly updating its video poker database. Although online gambling virtualizes the Casino, sometimes a gambler feels nostalgic for playing in a live casino, where they meet real people and play with real cards and dealers. This is precisely what live dealers bring to you, though at your convenience. And this Casino has a variety of live dealers to choose from. These titles are mainly provided by Evolution games, with live streams from their studios in Atlantic City. Some of their popular titles include Blackjack, Three Card Poker, Roulette, Baccarat, Ultimate Texas, or Hold’em for punters seeking a more poker-like experience. There are some great existing customer promotions for SugarHouse Casino regulars and with free play games and a strong loyalty program. One thing that really stands out at SugarHouse is how they try and foster a sense of community among their casino players through their community chat and social media channels. For every spin you make on Happy Hour featured slot game between 5PM-9M, you will receive double the Loyalty Points. SugarHouse drops invitations to play free bingo games for bonus cash every day, just check your account to RSVP. There are up to 20 games a day to get involved with.

Bills’ or ‘Finish the Song with DJ CA$H’ where there is the chance to answer questions and enter competitions to win bonuses. SugarHouse online casino players earn loyalty points when they wager real money cash, with bigger and better bonuses on offer as you climb through the levels of the iRush Rewards by playing more cash on a monthly basis.

Given their presence in the North East of America, it would not be surprising to see more states launch in the coming years. The SugarHouse New Jersey Promo Code is 250MATCH. SugarHouse began offering online casino betting in 2016, and was the first of any online betting that SugarHouse had done. The Garden State remains to this day the only state to offer SugarHouse Casino, with those NJ bettors the only lucky ones to get their hands on the SugarHouse desktop site and fantastic mobile app. New customers do not need a bonus code to claim the SugarHouse Casino promo code, just sign up through the link and create your account to claim.

Those in New Jersey are the only ones that are able to bet with SugarHouse Casino legally, with other states awaiting the launch of SugarHouse Casino. On the whole, SugarHouse Casino is a strong choice to go with , with their large variety of games on offer being a major contributing factor to their success. Their huge selection of slots are also a major plus, with an excellent RTP % amongst the leading members of the field of online Casinos. Although, it can be said that the layout of their desktop site could be improved, whilst also offering a separate section for their live dealer tables would be a good way to improve the overall quality of their site. The fact they are legal and licensed in just one state does hold them back, as it means less people are able to use the site, and give feedback to generate improvements and updates. However despite this, SugarHouse still operates a great online casino, one which we’d definitely recommend giving a go if you’re on the lookout for a new casino site to play with. The new customer offer with SugarHouse sportsbooks entitles you to a first deposit match up to the value of $250. This means if you deposit $250 first time round, SugarHouse will match that deposit to the value of $250 in free bets. Wagering requirements are less common in the world of sports betting, so the bonus you get with the SugarHouse code doesn’t have the same ‘Wow’ factor that the Casino bonus has. It’s still a very solid and healthy bonus amount for a site which is more known for its expertise in the Casino world, and is certainly one worth taking advantage of. There’s a great range of existing customer promos for sports bettors to take advantage of at SugarHouse. The following promotions are live on the site at the time of writing.

That’s certainly not a bad thing, as BetRivers has some great features and promotions for all customers. Despite being renowned as a Casino site, SugarHouse still poses a strong online sports betting site. In addition to the strong lineup of betting markets that exist at Sugarhouse, there are a number of features that will appeal to sports bettors. Their odds are strong, with the same game parlay and parlay betting all available at SugarHouse sportsbook. There’s also a whole host of promotions and offers for existing customers, giving you a little extra value for your winning wagers. In conclusion, SugarHouse Sportsbook is a great place to place your sports wagers. Their new customer offer is not quite up to the standard of some of the big boys in sports betting, but they still give a good account of themselves in the states in which they are live. While the Sugarhouse app was a work in progress when it first launched in NJ back in 2018, it has since eliminated all the bugs and become one of the top mobile betting apps on the market today. In New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, the app is a combination of both its online casino and sportsbook. Because of this, you’ll need to access the sportsbook’s main betting page from the upper-left corner of the main menu. The hub includes the big events of the day and the most popular in-season sports. If the sportsbook doesn’t have a quick link to what you’re looking for, click on the “more sports” link. Indeed, this will take you to all of its available sports, from cricket and darts to any soccer league you can imagine, to many of the sports leagues from around the world. Make sure to also watch the scrolling banner atop the page for the newest promotions and reward offerings. Among those features is the ability to live stream sporting events from the sportsbook. Events in the world of tennis, hockey, and soccer are especially prominent in the live streaming section. This allows bettors to wager on games and watch them all in one convenient location. Another fun feature at Sugarhouse is their Specials section, which offers boosted odds on unique wagers throughout their sportsbook for upcoming events. Bettors can wager on things like golf futures, NBA player props, or parlays across multiple sports at prices that are better than they would be otherwise. While these may not always be prudent bets, bettors can evaluate these boosted markets for themselves and find added value in the event that they are worth wagering on. Finally, the Starting Soon section is a feature that makes betting at Sugarhouse extremely easy. Bettors who go to the Starting Soon section can find all of the games that are going to begin in the near future across several sports. For bettors who are looking to get bets in before the 1 pm Eastern NFL games or the start of a day baseball game, this area is ideal so as not to miss the beginning of those contests. It may be as expected that SugarHouse Sportsbook’s new customer offer is not quite as big as some of the big names in sports betting, such as FanDuel or BetMGM. Should SugarHouse improve their welcome offer, that would go a long way to improving the overall quality of their sportsbook.
