Get ready, get set, jet! Jet off to your next summer travel destination, that is, with this flash sale from JetBlue Vacations. The airline’s vacation package site is a one-stop-shop to booking flights and hotel packages, with extra perks like hotel credits, early boarding and more thrown into the mix to sweeten the deal. Now through June 16, save up to $300 on either flight and hotel packages or flight and cruise packages, perfect for a last-minute Father’s Day gift, summer holiday or a solo adventure. Use the promo code Summer2022 at checkout to get in on the deals, browsing top summer destinations like Aruba, Cancún, Punta Cana and more. The best part of the sale is that while you need to book your flight by June 16, you can travel anytime from June 20 through Sept. 30.

For those that haven’t tried JetBlue Vacations yet, there are even more perks to be enjoyed, aside from this amazing flash sale. When booking your vacation, you can also add on local experiences with the JetBlue Vacations Insider Experience program, making for a fully planned itinerary and no stress once you arrive.
