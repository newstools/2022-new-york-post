When NYC Pride Parade kicks off on Sunday, it will be a contingent from Planned Parenthood leading the way. NYC Pride is set to host its first in-person Pride Parade since 2019 as thousands of attendees are ready to take to the streets of lower Manhattan with the Roe v. Wade decision fueling the fight for human rights and amplifying the message at this year’s event. The march, which first started in 1970, will begin at noon at Fifth Avenue and 25th Street, continuing west on 8th Street before dispersing on Seventh Ave and 15th Street. NYC Pride announced Planned Parenthood will be the first contingent to march in the parade following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. “As millions gather for LGBTQIA+ Pride this weekend in New York City and cities across the country, our voices will be heard – for the LGBTQ people impacted and the millions with whom we stand in solidarity,” NYC Pride said in the announcement. “Pride was born of protest and will always be a space to fight injustice and discrimination. Join us as we advocate for bodily autonomy at this year’s NYC Pride March.” Activist TS Madison, “Saturday Night Live” star Punkie Johnson, NCAA swimmer Schuyler Bailar, activist Dominique Morgan, and lawyer Chase Strangio will serve as Grand Marshals for this year. The event is free and open for everyone to attend. In 2019, roughly 5 million people attended the WorldPride Parade, which marked the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. For those unable to make the trip into Manhattan, the parade will air on ABC7 in the tri-state area. The forecast calls for 86-degree temperatures and sunny weather for the parade, according to Weather.com.
