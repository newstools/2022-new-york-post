A second Russian general is reportedly dead after heavy fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region over the weekend. Lt. Gen. Roman Berdnikov, formerly the commander of Russian troops in Syria, is believed to have died Sunday, possibly in the same battle that killed Russian Maj. Gen. Roman Kutuzov,  Russian-language Telegram channel Volya Media reported. The generals were in an armored column that was ambushed by Ukrainian forces, possibly on a bridge somewhere in the Donbas, according to the report. The exact details of the exchange are not yet known. Berdnikov’s death has not been confirmed by Russian state-run outlets or the Kremlin. If confirmed, the death of such a senior leader would be a blow to Russia’s stated goal of occupying the Donbas, despite the success of the Kremlin’s offensive in the northern half of the region in recent days. Kutuzov’s death was confirmed Sunday by Russian state media journalist Alexander Sladkov. He did not provide any details as to the location of the attack that killed the general, nor did he mention Berdnikov’s death. Ukrainian officials claim to have killed more than a dozen Russian generals since the war began.
