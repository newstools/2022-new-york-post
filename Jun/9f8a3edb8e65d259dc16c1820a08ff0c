You don’t become the richest man in the world by listening to what mom says. Or at least that’s the case for Elon Musk. The tech magnate — who is worth a comfortable $229 billion — owns Tesla Motors and SpaceX, but in recent weeks he’s been flirting with the idea of adding Twitter owner to his resume. Now, his mother, Maye Musk, weighed in on his decision to sign on the dotted line for the social media app, revealing her input doesn’t have too much of an effect on her son’s decision-making process. Appearing on Today With Hoda & Jenna, the 73-year-old model was asked for her thoughts about Elon’s desire to buy Twitter. “He should do whatever he wants,” she said in response. “I told him not to do an electric car, as well as rockets and he didn’t listen to me.” When asked to clarify whether she was against Elon kickstarting Tesla altogether, she said it wasn’t so much the business venture itself as it was his undying working habits. “He worked so hard, he needed a break,” she explained. “And he wants to take on solar energy and electric cars and rockets. And I said, just choose one so that you don’t work so hard.” Maye shares Elon, 50, son Kimbal, 49, and daughter Tosca, 47, with her ex-husband, Errol Musk. Musk recently said he will not go through with his $44 billion takeover of Twitter unless the social media platform offers definitive proof that less than 5 percent of its daily users are spam and bot accounts. Last month, he estimated that spambots comprised nearly 20 percent of Twitter’s 229 million users — a whopping four times more than the figure touted by the company. He initially took a $12.5 billion margin loan, but earlier this month reduced it to $6.25 billion after bringing in co-investors. In April, Musk had lined up $46.5 billion in debt and equity financing to buy Twitter, with Musk himself committing $33.5 billion.
