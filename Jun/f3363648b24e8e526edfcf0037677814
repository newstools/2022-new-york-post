Should your first Points Betting wager with PointsBet also losing, 100% of your stake will also be rewarded back to you in the form of free bets, with $1,500 being the maximum stake for this offer. Any winning bets that these free bets are used for will be paid out in full, however the free bet itself will not be included as a part of your winnings.  PointsBet has successfully emigrated into the USA having originally launched in Australia, and is available in the following states: PointsBet Colorado – The online sportsbook  launched in November 2020, 6-months after sports betting was legalized in Colorado. The only limitation with Colorado sports betting is there is no wagering on sports betting permitted, but with the Broncos, Avalanche and Nuggets all in the Centennial State, there’s no shortage of teams to get behind. PointsBet Illinois – PointsBet debuted in Illinois in September 2020, just missing out on the start of the 2020 NFL season. Bettors in Illinois have reaped the benefits of PointsBet for some time now, as Illinois stands as one of the longest serving states to PointsBet. PointsBet Indiana – PointsBet sportsbook launched in March 2020, an unfortunate time for the world of sport. Since then, bettors in Indiana have been able to enjoy all the works of PointsBet sportsbook. College sports betting is not permitted, but with a whole host of professional sports franchises, there’s no shortage of action. PoinsBet Iowa – PointsBet went live in November 2019, became the 4th online sportsbook to launch in Iowa. PointsBet joined other big names in online sports betting to launch in Iowa, despite the lack of a real professional sports presence in the Hawkeye State. PointsBet Michigan – Pointsbet launched in January 2021, the first day online sports betting was allowed in Michigan. The Great Lake State became the first to host PointsBet online casino later in May, with the sportsbook’s land-based partner is the Northern Waters Casino Resort in Watersmeet. PointsBet New Jersey – As with many operators, PointsBet first launched in New Jersey in January 2018. The longest serving state, but perhaps the least professional sports scene of all. Bettors in New Jersey have really lucked out, being able to enjoy a plethora of sports betting sites, with PointsBet amongst the very best. PointsBet New York – PointsBet was confirmed as one of the nine operators awarded a license to operate in New York back in November 2021.

PointsBet Pennsylvania – Pennsylvania was buzzing with rumors of a potential PointsBet launch for quite some time and after a soft-launch, in the first week of February 2022, the speculation became reality when PointsBet officially launched in Pennsylvania on February 10, 2022. PointsBet Virginia – PointsBet expanded its reach to Virginia at the end of 2021 with the launch of an online and mobile sportsbook in mid-December. It partnered with Colonial Downs Group, which runs a racetrack in New Kent. Since you can only bet online in Virginia at the moment, there is no retail PointsBet sportsbook in the state. PointsBet West Virginia – PointsBet debuted in West Virginia in August 2021, but it also went live with an online casino in January 2022. Although it partnered with Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, PointsBet does not offer a land-based sportsbook in the state. Only two teams remain in the hunt for the NBA Championship. Golden State Warriors took just five games to get past Dallas Mavericks, whilst Boston Celtics and Miami Heat contested an amazing seven game series. The Celtics prevailed, and now meet the Warriors. Boston took the first game, before Golden State tied the series heading into game three.

Also known as ‘in-play betting,’ live betting is generally available via the most popular sportsbooks in the USA.  PointsBet’s live betting section is easy to navigate and provides users with plenty of opportunities to wager as the action unfolds. PointsBetting is a unique form of betting only available at PointsBet in the U.S. It is a high-risk, high-reward option where bettors can win or lose more based on the outcome of their wager. PointsBetting is only available on selected fixed-odds markets, and is mostly placed on the spread betting market. Live streaming is a new PointsBet feature. It is currently limited to specific sporting events primarily played at off-peak times, such as tennis, soccer, volleyball, table tennis, and esports. PointsBet’s Cash Out feature is available for most pre-match singles in fixed-odds bets, and the available markets are marked accordingly. After placing a bet that supports early cash out, you will be able to settle the wager at any time. As a result, you can collect winnings on your bet before the match is over or cut your losses if things aren’t going as expected.

If you’re a fan of sports outside of the USA, then you’ll want to check out PointsBet. Major and minor leagues across Europe, Asia and South America are all offered for many sports at PointsBet. Live streaming is a relatively new addition to PointsBet sportsbook, so it comes as no surprise that they’re not quite up to scratch with some of the other big names in sports betting. Whilst live streaming is still available, we’d like to see more sports offered for live streaming, to get bettors closer to the action. As PointsBet themselves put it, the more you’re right, the more you win. On the flip side, the more you’re wrong, the more you lose. However, users can set limits ahead of time to control their maximum risk and reward before placing a bet. Points betting, traditionally known as spread betting, provides the added benefit of keeping every game interesting from start to finish. For example, watching your team run away with the lead is much more exciting when you know your payout grows by every additional point by which your team increases its margin of victory. Let’s take an example using the 2022 NBA finals matchup. Boston Celtics are taking on Golden State Warriors, and PointsBet has set the total at 230 points. A PointsBet customer decides to take the over for $10 per point. Below are a few of the many outcomes that could occur with this PointsBetting wager:  Once you’ve claimed your new-customer offer, there are plenty of brilliant existing promotions available which are available for all existing customers of PointsBet.  21+.

As with many online sportsbooks, PointsBet has their own referral scheme. If you refer a friend through your very own unique referral link, once they’ve placed a $20 wager, both you and your friend will receive a $100 free bet. One brilliant aspect of the PointsBet referral scheme is that bettors are only limited to a maximum of $2,500 free bets a year, meaning you can refer up to 25 friends per year. Many online sportsbooks have a maximum limit on the number of referrals they allow, but PointsBet allows you to take advantage of this referral scheme every year.
