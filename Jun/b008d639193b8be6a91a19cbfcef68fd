The Rudin family’s Three Times Square got a vote of confidence from leading banks with a $415 million refinancing of the 30-story building, which was one of the pioneering quartet of towers in the “New Times Square.” JP Morgan led a lending consortium that included Bank of America and M&T Bank. The tower is a joint venture of the Rudins and Thomson Reuters. As Realty Check first reported last January, Touro College and University System signed a lease for more than 243,000 square feet at Three Times Square. The Rudins plan to use loan proceeds to continue capital improvements at the location including a new lobby, a tenants’ amenity floor, outdoor space and modernized systems.
