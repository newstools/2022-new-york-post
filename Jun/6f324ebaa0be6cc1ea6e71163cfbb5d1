A man is in critical condition after he was shot in the chest in Brooklyn early Sunday morning — the latest incident capping off a violent day for Mayor Eric Adams’ neighborhood. A 33-year-old man was struck in the chest in front of the Brevoort public housing complex on Ralph Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant around 12:15 a.m., cops said. An unknown suspect fled the scene before police arrived. The victim was transported to King’s County Hospital in serious condition. The shooting was one of several incidents in the neighborhood, nearby to Mayor Eric Adams’ home. Hours earlier, a grandmother was killed and her 8-year-old grandson was left fighting for his life when the driver of a suspected stolen car slammed into them while trying to evade police. Three others were also hospitalized in the reckless rampage, which spanned five blocks and ended at the corner of Ralph Avenue and Halsey Street around 7:10 p.m., just down the street from the shooting. Then, around 11:30 p.m., four people were shot outside of the Stuyvesant Gardens Houses on Quincy Street, including an 8-year-old boy, who received a graze wound. All four were taken to Kings County Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Speaking at a press conference at the site of the fatal car crash, the mayor called the incident “chilling.” “This is my community. I live blocks from here. I patronize these stores. These are my neighbors. No one deserves to walk across the street with their grandchild and to be struck.”
