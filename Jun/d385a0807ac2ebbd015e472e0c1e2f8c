A group of cocky subway surfers were filmed running on top of the cars of the Brooklyn-bound J-train on the Williamsburg Bridge. At least eight people pulled the perilous exploit  Friday as the train entered into Williamsburg from Manhattan’s Lower East Side and approached the Marcy Avenue station, footage posted online showed. Some of the brash daredevils were seen enthusiastically sprinting and skipping along the length of the subway car as other more cautious thrill seekers sat or crouched on the roof of the train during the reckless ride. Most of the suspects wore black and identifying features were hard to see from the video clips, which appeared to be taken from high-rise buildings near the mouth of the bridge. The NYPD said it was aware of the footage, and said the suspects could be charged with trespassing and reckless endangerment. “We don’t recommend that individuals ride on top of the subway train,” a sergeant told The Post. The MTA declined to comment on the incident and deferred to police. Last year, a man died while subway surfing on the J train when he fell onto the tracks and was crushed by the train as it entered Manhattan after a 1.7 mile ride across the Williamsburg Bridge. New York City subways can reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour between stations that are far apart from each other, according to Gothamist.
