A pending home sale near Palm Beach for roughly $175 million is expected to shatter the record for the most expensive Florida property transfer in history, according to a report. The Wall Street Journal said Wednesday that billionaire internet entrepreneur Jim Clark has secured a buyer for his 16-acre spread on a barrier island off Manalapan. The sale would easily eclipse the nearly $140 million paid in cash by a mystery buyer for a 21,000-square-foot Palm Beach property in February 2021. The Netscape founder, who bought the compound for a relative bargain of $94 million in March of 2021, declined to identify the buyer, the outlet reported. Clark told the Journal that he unloaded the home because he did not plan on spending a significant time in Florida and that he was leery of ominous economic conditions. The oceanfront jewel boasts 1,200 feet of water frontage along with a 63,200-square-foot main home and a seven-bedroom guest quarters, according to the report. The new buyer will also benefit from a pool, three-hole golf course and a dock. Clark also owns homes in Manhattan and Bedford, New York, the paper wrote. Florida’s scorching housing market has seen a frenzied run on trophy estates in elite enclaves like Palm Beach in recent years. But if the deal consummates, the sale of Clark’s home would set a clear price record for the Sunshine State, according to the report. The tech titan — who said the home was a “spur of the moment purchase” — plans to spend the bulk of his time back in New York.
