A Canadian dad whose three children were killed by a drunk driver in 2015 took his own life in the hours after Father’s Day. Edward Lake’s wife Jennifer Neville-Lake shared the tragic news about her husband along with a photo of their three children — Daniel, Harry and Milly, who were 9, 5 and 2 when they died in the crash. “The eyes he shared with Harry are forever closed Daniel’s curls will never shine in the sunlight again I will never see Milly’s shy smile creep across his lips anymore My children’s father, Edward Lake, has joined our kids so they can play together, forever,” Neville-Lake’s Monday tweet read. “Mahal kita, Edward,” she wrote, which means “I love you” in Filipino. A day before she shared a post with a picture of the children’s graves. “This shouldn’t be real. It can’t be,” the caption read. The children’s grandfather, Gary Neville, was also killed in the suburban Toronto crash. Their grandmother and great-grandmother were badly injured, according to yorkregion.com, which reported Lake’s suicide. Her family was driving the children to their home when drunk driver Marco Muzzo T-boned their vehicle in the city of Vaughan, the outlet said. Muzzo was reportedly granted full parole in 2021. “I don’t have anyone left to call me mom. You killed all my babies,” Jennifer told Muzzo at his sentencing hearing in 2016, according to CityNews Toronto. “You deserve to know what it’s like to have every single life you created taken from you,” she said. Lake told the outlet at the time of the sentencing hearing that he was grappling with “suicidal thoughts and intense anxiety.” If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.
