The NBA offseason is starting to heat up. A day before the free-agency period officially begins, the Wizards and Nuggets have agreed to a trade that will send Will Barton and Monte Morris to Washington in exchange for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Ish Smith, according to multiple reports. Morris is coming off a career year with the Nuggets, playing much of the season in place of the injured Jamal Murray and averaging 12.6 points per game, along with 4.4 assists. However, with Murray under contract and expected to return, the team clearly felt it was possible to move Morris – along with Barton, who started 71 games and averaged 14.7 points. In return, Denver will receive Caldwell-Pope, who averaged 13.2 points in his first season in Washington, and Smith, a 12-year veteran who was traded from Charlotte in the middle of last season. It’s the sixth time Smith has been traded throughout his career. If Smith plays for the Nuggets, he’d make NBA history by playing for his 13th different team. Per the Denver Post, the Nuggets had been targeting Caldwell-Pope since last year’s trade deadline. Now, they have their man.
