US forces captured a senior ISIS leader who is known as a bomb maker during an operation in Syria on Thursday. Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led coalition against The Islamic State, said no civilians were harmed in the operation and there were no damages incurred to coalition aircraft or assets. “The mission was meticulously planned to minimize the risk of collateral damage, particularly any potential harm to civilians,” the coalition said in a statement. The identity of the ISIS leader, described as “one of the group’s top leaders in Syria,” has not been released. Additional details on the operation were not immediately available. “Coalition forces will continue to hunt the remnants of Daesh wherever they hide to ensure their enduring defeat,” Operation Inherent Resolve said. In February, ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi blew himself up, killing his wife and two kids as US special forces swooped into the Syrian village of Atmeh. In October 2019, ISIS leader and mastermind Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children, and injuring a US military dog as troops busted into a compound in Syria. Two US soldiers also suffered minor injuries in the raid.
