Justin Bieber will be forced to reschedule his June 14 concert date in New York, should the Eastern Conference Final series between the Rangers and Lightning require a Game 7, a spokesperson for Madison Square Garden told The Post. Bieber is scheduled to perform at The Mecca next Tuesday at 7 p.m., but in the event of a Game 7, New York and Tampa Bay would take the ice instead at 8 p.m. The Rangers currently lead the best-of-seven series, 2-1, with Game 4 set for Tuesday in Tampa. Game 5 is scheduled for Thursday at MSG, with a possible Game 6 slated for Saturday in Tampa. The winner of the Rangers-Lightning series will take on the Colorado Avalanche, who completed a four-game sweep against the Edmonton Oilers on Monday to reach the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 2001.
