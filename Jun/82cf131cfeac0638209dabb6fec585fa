Cooper Kupp is “so thankful” for wife Anna and their young family for helping to make his NFL dreams a reality. On Wednesday, the Rams receiver agreed to a three-year, $80 million contract extension with the team, four months after being named the MVP of Super Bowl 2022. Shortly after the deal was announced, Kupp expressed gratitude for Anna in a message shared on Instagram. “My family.. Anna, June, Cypress. Thank you for your willingness to allow me to play the game I love to the utmost,” Kupp wrote, referencing the couple’s young sons. “More than anyone else you understand the sacrifices to compete at the highest level, and you choose to join me in it as well. I am so thankful to share in that with the people I love most.” Kupp and Anna have been married since 2015, two years before the Rams selected him with the 69th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. “The Los Angeles Rams made a childhood vision a reality when they showed their belief in me on draft day.. and today they showed continued faith. For that, I want to thank the Kroenke family, the front office, and Coach McVay,” Kupp said Wednesday in his Instagram message. The 28-year-old receiver had a year for the record books last season, leading the league in receptions (145), receiving yards (1,947), and receiving touchdowns (16). He also scored  two touchdowns during the Rams’ Super Bowl victory over the Bengals and was named the game’s MVP. In the weeks following the Rams’ Super Bowl win, Kupp and Anna enjoyed their victory lap, living it up in both Disneyland and Las Vegas. This past weekend, however, the Kupps celebrated Rams coach Sean McVay, who married longtime fiancée Veronika Khomyn at the Beverly Hills Hotel. “An amazing night celebrating an amazing couple. Here’s to a lifetime of happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Mcvay (who know how to throw a party !!),” Anna gushed Sunday on Instagram.
