A Long Island man was slapped with a 20-year prison term after he admitted to sexually abusing children at his wife’s at-home day care. Angel Tacuri, 53, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing eight kids from ages 3 to 10 and was sentenced Thursday, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office. The perverted behavior took place for five years starting in 2010 inside his wife’s unlicensed business. District Attorney Raymond Tierney assailed the creepy convict for the way he “traumatized” innocent kids. “This defendant took the innocence of small children and traumatized them in the process to satisfy his depraved desires and that is something they will never have back,” Tierney said in a statement. “This extensive sentence guarantees the defendant will no longer be able to harm any more children and ensures he will be monitored for years after he is released from prison.” Tacuri pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree course of sexual conduct against a child, one count of first-degree criminal sexual act and two counts of first degree sexual abuse. He was charged with victimizing six children in June 2021, but another two came forward after that, prosecutors said. On top of the 20 years in a jail cell, he was sentenced to 20 years post-release supervision, the district attorney’s office said. Prior to his plea, Tacuri faced 50 years in prison, Suffolk County police said when he was initially charged last year.
