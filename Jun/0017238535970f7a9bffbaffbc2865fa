LOS ANGELES — Max Scherzer has a new injury, but it’s not likely to cost him additional time on the injured list. At home in Florida, the Mets right-hander was bitten by one of his dogs in recent days, according to a source. The bite was to Scherzer’s pitching hand, according to a team official, but still won’t set him back in his rehab. Scherzer is on the IL with an oblique strain and rehabbing for a potential July return to the Mets. Scherzer’s dog bite occurred in a week when Francisco Lindor jammed his right middle finger in the double doors in his hotel suite and missed a game. Lindor, diagnosed with a fracture, returned to the Mets’ lineup Friday night. Before the Mets opened their four-game series against the Dodgers, which is continuing through the weekend, manager Buck Showalter said the 37-year-old Scherzer’s rehab from the oblique strain was progressing in a satisfactory manner. “Who knows what he is doing away from the [complex], he has probably had four or five sides by now,” Showalter said. “His ‘want to’ is off the charts, but from what we can tell he is doing well.”
