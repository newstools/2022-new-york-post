Sting and Trudie Styler have an eye for real estate — from their 16th-century British lake house on 800 acres near Stonehenge to their Tuscan estate and their $65.7 million condo at 220 Central Park South. Now their former rental — a floor-through duplex in the curvaceous Zaha Hadid building on the High Line, which they rented since 2018 — has hit the market for $18.95 million. The stunning home, at 520 W. 28th St., is 4,460 square feet and comes with a giant, 2,040-square-foot wrap terrace. A private elevator landing opens to a wide entry gallery — perfect to showcase an art collection — and leads to a great room with a fireplace and walls of glass. Beyond is a wrap terrace, which has a gas hookup for an outdoor kitchen and views from the High Line to Chelsea and the Empire State Building. The main bedroom is tucked away in its own wing with a windowed ensuite bath, dressing room and a terrace. A chef’s kitchen leads to a separate family/media room with a lower level holding three bedrooms and a service entrance. In New York, the couple had previously lived in 15 Central Park West, which, like 220 CPS, was designed by architect Robert A.M. Stern’s firm. That apartment sold for $50 million in 2018; they bought at 220 CPS in 2019. The listing brokers are Steve Gold, of “Million Dollar Listing New York,” as well as Julie Pham and Peter Zaitzeff — all of Corcoran.
