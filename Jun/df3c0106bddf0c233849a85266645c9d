A Hell’s Kitchen loft inside a former theater, one where a young Meryl Streep once performed, is on the market for $2.39 million. The home, at 414 W. 51st St., is in the former Cubiculo Theatre, which opened in 1968 as an off-off-Broadway experimental performance space. Streep made her off-Broadway debut there as a fishermaid, Tisbea, in the theater’s production of Tirso de Molina’s “The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest.” The five-story brownstone was built in 1910. It’s now aptly known as the Cubiculo Condominium and was also home for the National Shakespeare Company, founded in 1962 by Philip Meister and Elaine Sulka. It’s now divided into three condo units. This two-bedroom, two-bath unit is 1,800 square feet. It comes with 12-foot ceilings, plenty of light, a 400-square-foot loft as well as a garden and a grill. There’s a chef’s kitchen, oversize windows, an open living/dining area and a home office, which could convert to a small third bedroom. The main bedroom comes with exposed brick walls, built-in storage and a library ladder to reach the elevated storage areas. The listing brokers are Lisa Chajet, Bonnie Chajet and Adjina Dekidjiev of Coldwell Banker Warburg.
