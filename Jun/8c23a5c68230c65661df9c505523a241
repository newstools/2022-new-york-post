BTS fans can breathe a sigh of relief, as the widely popular K-pop band is not going on hiatus any time soon. It was reported on Tuesday that the South Korean boy band would be taking a break as a group to pursue solo projects. However, news surfaced on Thursday that the band is not breaking up and the hiatus phrase was a simple mistranslation, according to their management team HYBE. A rep for the boys told The Post, “To be clear, they are not on hiatus but will take time to explore some solo projects at this time and remain active in various different formats.” While the members will still be undertaking solo work, they won’t stop collaborating together. BTS released a video in Korean earlier this week to announce the next stage of their careers when they reportedly said they would be going on a “temporary hiatus,” but promised they would “return someday.” Band member RM said in the video that it was time to work on their own so they can grow as people. “I always thought that BTS was different from other groups, but the problem with K-pop and the whole idol system is that they don’t give you time to mature. You have to keep producing music and keep doing something,” RM said. “We can’t help but think of our fans no matter what, we want to be the kind of artists that are remembered by our fans. I think now we’re starting to think about what kind of artists we each want to be remembered by our fans,” member Jimin added. He continued, “I think that’s why we’re going through a rough patch right now, we’re trying to find our identity and that’s an exhausting and long process.” Member Jung Kook also went live on the streaming app V Live on Thursday to assure fans that the group will continue to work together, even as they focus more on individual work. BTS’ stock also allegedly went down on Wednesday following the supposed hiatus announcement, Variety noted. HYBE lost $1.7 billion of market value on the Korean stock exchange.
