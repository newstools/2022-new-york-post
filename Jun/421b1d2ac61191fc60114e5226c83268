New York City plans to open 10 vaccination hubs Wednesday to provide COVID-19 shots to kids ages 6 months through 5. The sites will only offer the two-dose Moderna vaccine and appointments can be made starting Tuesday on the city’s vaccine finder site or by calling 877-VAX-4NYC. The hubs are in all five boroughs and include locations in Times Square, the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, the Queens mall and the Empire Outlets on Staten Island. The city’s plan coincides with Saturday’s expected CDC approval of both the Moderna and Pfizer shots for kids. The FDA gave the greenlight to the vaccines Friday.
