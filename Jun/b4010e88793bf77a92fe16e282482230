In fact, on the average person’s calendar already are three weddings, three birthday parties and three family vacations, among other events. While respondents know what they’re signing up for. 62 percent know they’re going to be exhausted from their travels. However, 73 percent feel like they’ll get better sleep in hotels. In fact, 75% of respondents said they feel more refreshed than usual waking up away from home. Luckily for Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber — who just launched skincare lines — 37 percent of respondents prioritize following their beauty routine before bed more so on vacation than at home (32 percent).
