A man’s rotting body was found under a couch at a Queens apartment Wednesday — and cops say it appears he was dead for weeks. Police were responding to a report of a foul odor inside an apartment on Jamaica Avenue near 77th Street in Woodhaven around 1 p.m. when they discovered the man under the sofa with trauma to his back, authorities said. EMS responded, and the man was pronounced dead on scene. “The body was so badly decomposed they don’t know who it is,” a police source told The Post. Because the body was so decomposed, investigators believe he may have been dead for a couple weeks, cops said. The city medical examiner’s office will officially determine how he died. Police had no information on the circumstances Thursday morning. No arrests have been made.
