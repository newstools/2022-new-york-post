Opening arguments in the Nipsey Hussle murder trial are set to begin Wednesday, more than three years after the rapper was murdered outside his Los Angeles clothing store. A jury was selected Monday to hear the case against accused killer Eric Ronald Holder Jr. — and six alternate jurors were being chosen on Tuesday, according to KTTV. Holder, 32, allegedly shot Hussle – whose real name was Ermias Joseph Asghedom – on March 31, 2019, after an argument. Deputy District Attorney John McKinney told a grand jury in 2019 that the “Grinding All My Life” artist accused Holder of “snitching,” which McKinney added, “in the gang world, is a very serious offense.” “The conversation wasn’t particularly intense, it wasn’t particularly belligerent, and it lasted for about four minutes,” he said. Both men were affiliated with the Rollin’ 60s gang in South Los Angeles, officials said. Holder returned to The Marathon Clothing in Hyde Park several minutes later and used two guns to fire multiple shots at Hussle, hitting him 11 times and injuring two others, prosecutors allege. He was arrested days later, pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder charges and has been jailed since. Hussle, a Grammy-nominated rapper and father of two, was 33 years old at the time of his death. With AP wires
