The storybook ending that Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa envisioned when he came out of retirement to lead the Chicago White Sox certainly didn’t include fans calling for his firing. But chants of “Fire Tony!” came from the stands at Guaranteed Rate Field as the White Sox blew a five-run lead Saturday and lost, 11-9, to the Texas Rangers. The White Sox dropped to 27-30 and six games behind the American League Central Division-leading Minnesota Twins. “I hear it with one ear and I see it with one eye,” La Russa told reporters afterward. “I just know I appreciate [that] they want us to win. And, when we don’t win, they’re unhappy.” LaRussa, 77, had not managed since leading the St. Louis Cardinals to the World Series title in 2011 before piloting the White Sox to the playoffs in his successful return last season. He was inducted into Cooperstown during his decade out of the dugout. On top of the poor record, La Russa is under fire for a decision he made Thursday, when he bizarrely called for an intentional walk of Los Angeles Dodgers star Trea Turner despite a 1-2 count. Max Muncy followed with a three-run home run to send the White Sox to the second of what is now three losses in four games. “There isn’t anything that’s happening with this team that, in the end, I’m not responsible for,” La Russa said. “Never dodged accountability and I won’t start now.” This seems to be the season of managers who won World Series rings elsewhere getting fired by teams. Joe Girardi, who won with the Yankees, was fired by the Phillies not long after fans chanted for his dismissal. Joe Maddon, who won with the Cubs, was fired by the Angels after 12 straight losses in what became a 14-game losing streak.
