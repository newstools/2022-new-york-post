Robert Downey Jr. celebrated Johnny Depp’s victory in his defamation case against Amber Heard with a call to his pal over FaceTime. Depp’s close friend Josh Richman revealed the FaceTime conversation with a group of Depp supporters during a charity live stream event for Children’s Hospital Los Angles. “John, thank God it’s over,” Downey Jr. told his old pal Depp over FaceTime. The 59-year-old actor was “stoic” in a UK hotel room while his friends and staff cried and screamed around him when the verdict was announced. Even Jeff Beck flipped off the television screen, Richman explained. A spokesman for Depp confirmed to The Post that Downey Jr. FaceTimed the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star after the verdict was announced. Richman also said that Depp had no intention of asking his ex-girlfriend Kate Moss to testify during the trial yet things quickly changed once Heard took the witness stand. Heard mentioned Moss’ name during her testimony and the notoriously private model was ‘pissed’ and was ‘like, f-ck this,’ Richman said. Richman continued “Her [Moss] goddaughter was like did Johnny Depp push you down the stairs? “She was like ‘no.'” Depp ended up inviting his former flame to see him perform alongside Beck at a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London a day before his trial win.
