Dana Brooke has revealed why she did not appear on “WWE Raw” on Monday. The WWE superstar tweeted Tuesday that she was involved in a “bad car accident.” “Much love to the #wweuniverse for the support & love, standing up for me!” she wrote. “The reason why I was not on RAW last night was because I got into a bad car accident [in] the past week, I am doing good & will be back in no time! I really appreciate the love & couldn’t ask for better.” The 33-year-old Brooke is WWE’s current 24/7 champion, which means she holds a belt that can change hands at any time – on or off the show – provided she is pinned, and the assailant has a referee available to count 1-2-3. Brooke’s real name is Ashley Mae Sebera; she joined WWE’s developmental NXT in 2013 and was promoted to the main roster in 2016. She announced her engagement to boxer Ulysses Diaz last June.
