Regarding our Father of the Year, Ken from Astoria: “All worthy candidates but you failed to mention Tom ‘Family Man’ Brady who retired so he could spend more time with the Brady Bunch.” Until the GOAT thought better of it and said NAA! NAA! Whodoyalike? Because I’m not crazy about the Monday menu. How’s the Fish today? Trevor Rogers starts for Miami. Mr. Rogers has lost only once in his last seven starts. The Mets’ David Peterson has been a bit more reliable this season after going 2-6 last year. Taking the road dogs. 10 units on the Marlins. Jennifer Lopez said pairing her with Shakira for the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show was “the worst idea.” We can top that one J.Lo. We backed the Phillies and Zach Eflin on Sunday and he was gone after two innings. Juan Soto and Maikel Franco homered and the Nationals phlogged Philly 9-3. Truth is we made that pick after falling off of our bike on Saturday. All good but the loss has us at +1,282 larrybowas.
