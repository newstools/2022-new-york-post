Many people will have experienced a time when their partner isn’t in the mood for sex. But one frustrated man decided to note down all of the reasons his wife gave him for not getting frisky between the sheets – and everyone is saying the same thing. TikTok user @joe_drae shared a video that revealed a long list of reasons his partner had given him over a period of time. Her first excuse was that they did it “last week,” the next was that she “wanted to cuddle” and the third was that she “felt bloated.” Other excuses involved their bedding, and she seemed keen to avoid sex on days it had just been washed. She also turned down some bedroom action if she “felt fat,” she was “too tired, if her “back hurt” or if she had “no energy.” The time of day also was a factor and she wasn’t keen if it was “too early” or “too late.” The same went for the room temperature, and the wife also said no if it was “too hot” or “too cold.” Other reasons to decline included her husband being “too drunk” or simply “the kids” with no further explanation. Although many people found the list hilarious and could relate to it, many people were quick to give the same feedback. One wrote: “It’s not her, it’s you.” Another added: “Real reason: man helped with 0 house chores or kids.” And a third commented: “Looks like the real reason isn’t actually those things…” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
