A Long Island motorist was arrested for allegedly fatally striking a mother of five while driving with a learner’s permit before fleeing the scene in Hauppauge last month, cops said. Madeline Henriquez, 23, of Brentwood, was driving eastbound on Motor Parkway when she collided with another vehicle at the intersection of Moreland Road around 10:15 p.m. on May 23, according to the Suffolk County Police Department. Henriquez’s 2012 Hyundai jumped the curb and hit 28-year-old Cherokee Fletcher, who was standing on the sidewalk, cops said. The suspect fled the scene in the car eastbound on Motor Parkway, according to police. Fletcher, of Commack, was pronounced dead at the scene by an official from the Office of the Suffolk County Medical Examiner. Family members told News 12 that the mother of five was walking across the street to the 7-Eleven to get money for her eldest son’s field trip. Her children range in age from 11 months to 7, the family said. After the fatal crash, Henriquez allegedly brought the vehicle to a repair shop in an attempt to hide the damages. Henriquez was charged with manslaughter, leaving the scene of an incident involving a fatality and tampering with physical evidence.
