Joel Dahmen has had far better drives on the course than off of it this weekend. Dahmen, who was the surprise co-leader of the U.S. Open after the first two days of the tournament, could not properly celebrate or even begin preparation for Saturday immediately. His first priority was finding his courtesy car. After the Washington native’s first ever 36-hole lead on the PGA Tour, both he and Collin Morikawa sitting at 5-under, Dahmen and his wife attempted to leave The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. It turned out to be more difficult than expected. “We actually do not have a car — someone took our vehicle from the valet, or they gave it to the wrong person,” Dahmen said on the “No Laying Up” podcast on Friday night. “I’m not sure how that’s working right now.” The 34-year-old conducted the interview while clearly distracted and awaiting word about his car. Around him were Netflix cameras and crew filming for the a docu-series that follows players on the PGA Tour. There was not a clear resolution to the case of the missing car, but Dahmen appeared to weather the situation OK. He was set to tee off at 3:45 p.m. on Saturday.
