This TikToker has taken a tanning trick to a whole new level — and it might not be in your skin’s best interest. Miriam Mroivili shared her “hack” for the perfect tan: mixing moisturizer and water in a spray bottle and applying it throughout your time in the sun. The video has received just under 350,000 likes with around 5.5 million views. The comments were mixed with some people tagging their friends, so they could sunbathe together and others immediately questioning where Mroivili’s sunscreen was. “As I’m sitting here with burnt and blistered shoulders covered in aftersun.. please put on suncream ,” one person commented. Mroivili then posted a follow-up video where she told viewers, “Remember SPF, especially on the first day. You need to get your skin used to the sun.” The video made its way to skin-care experts over at JustMyLook who strongly advised against anyone trying this method. “Not only is the process unsafe, but exposure to the sun in this way with no protection can severely increase the risk of sunburn which can lead to melanoma [skin cancer],” they told the Mirror. “We recommend wearing an SPF of 30 or more and applying it 15 minutes before exposing your skin to the sun.” They gave explicit instructions on the right way to use sunscreen saying, “Apply the equivalent of a shot glass [two tablespoons] of sunscreen to the exposed areas of the face and body to achieve the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) stated on the bottle of sun cream. “This way, you can still reap the benefits of the sun while minimizing the risk.” The American Academy of Dermatology Association suggests that everyone should wear sunscreen that offers protection against UVA and UVB rays and is water-resistant. They also noted that sunscreen alone cannot protect against “sunburn, early skin aging and skin cancer.” It is important to both seek shade when possible and to dress for the sun, including wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
