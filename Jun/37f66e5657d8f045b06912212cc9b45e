BTS is splitting up — for now. The K-pop boy band shared that they will be going on a “temporary hiatus” to pursue solo careers, but promised they would “return someday.” Several members broke down in tears as they shared the news. They made the announcement during their annual FESTA dinner, celebrating the founding of the band. Band member RM said it was time to work on their own so they can grow and mature as individuals. “I always thought that BTS was different from other groups, but the problem with K-pop and the whole idol system is that they don’t give you time to mature. You have to keep producing music and keep doing something,” RM said at the dinner. Other members of the South Korean boy band expressed their love for the fans. “We can’t help but think of our fans no matter what, we want to be the kind of artists that are remembered by our fans. I think now we’re starting to think about what kind of artists we each want to be remembered by our fans,” Jimin said. “I think that’s why we’re going through a rough patch right now, we’re trying to find our identity and that’s an exhausting and long process,” he added This month marked Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook’s ninth year together as BTS. BTS was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013. While this will be their first extended break, it’s not the first time they have taken one. They took a mini-break in 2019 and took some time off in December 2021.
