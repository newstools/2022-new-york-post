Not the summer blockbuster he was hoping for. Ben Affleck’s young son got behind the wheel of a yellow Lamborghini SUV on Sunday and smacked the pricey sports car into another vehicle when he accidentally went in reverse. Affleck and his fiancée Jennifer Lopez were at a luxury car rental dealership in Los Angeles when 10-year-old Samuel Garner Affleck got into a fender bender. Affleck let his son — who he shares with ex-wife Jennifer Garner — jump into the driver’s seat of the flashy car. The car — a Lamborghini Urus that rents for a whopping $1,475 per day — went into reverse and made contact with a white BMW. Samuel Affleck then got out of the car and checked on the two cars, according to the footage. Ben Affleck also checked for damage and comforted his son following the incident. He wrapped an arm around the boy in a tight embrace, a photo shows. A representative for Affleck told TMZ that there was no damage. An employee from the dealership, 777 Exotics, told the Post that the cars in their lot are parked tightly together. “When [Samuel] got into the car, it jerked back and forth,” he said. “We have a small lot and the cars are close.” No one was injured and there were no hard feelings, the employee said. “Everybody was OK!” he said. “They seemed happy and continued to browse.”The dealership would more than gladly welcome the stars back, he added. “Affleck loves cars,” the dealership staffer said. “We hope they come in again.” A rep for Jennifer Garner could not be reached for comment.
