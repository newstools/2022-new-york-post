Netflix released a statement Monday on the fatal auto crash that killed two actors near the Mexico set of “The Chosen One.” “We are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that took the lives of Ray Garduño and Juan Francisco González,” a Netflix spokesperson told Entertainment Weekly. “Our thoughts are with their loved ones and with those injured during this unfortunate accident.” The accident happened on the Baja California Sur peninsula on June 16. According to the Baja California Department of Culture, six other crew members were injured in the crash, in which their van flipped after running off a desert road. Based on the comic book series “Chosen” by Mark Millar and Peter Gross, the show follows a 12-year-old boy coming to the realization that he is the second coming of Christ and is destined to save humanity. The in-production series is not to be confused with 2019’s “The Chosen One” already streaming on Netflix, which follows three doctors attempting to bring the Zika vaccine to the remote Pantanal in South America. Production for the Garduño and González series began in April 2022, according to casting calls. “The development for ‘American Jesus’ is coming along beautifully in the talented and capable hands of Everardo Gout and Leopoldo Gout,” author Millar said of the project last month. “I’m blown away by the creative choices that Netflix has allowed us, and particularly since this series will feature Spanish and English dialogue.” A release date had yet to be announced.
