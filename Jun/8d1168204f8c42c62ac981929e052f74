Shocking new video shows the knockout punch that killed a 61-year-old man in front of his Brooklyn home late last month. Victor Vega, 61, was walking on Lexington Avenue near Nostrand Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant – alongside two men – around 8:30 p.m. May 25 when the deadly attack happened, authorities said. The men appeared to chat before the victim put his hand on the back of one of the duo, wearing a black hoodie and white face mask, video released by the NYPD late Wednesday shows. That man turned around and slugged Vega in the face, knocking him to the ground with a single punch in front of his home, the footage shows. Vega landed on his back – half on the sidewalk and half in the street – with his head under a parked car. WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT The attacker then picked Vega’s pockets and handed something to his accomplice, according to the video. Cops are investigating whether Vega was the victim of a drug robbery. Vega, who was left unconscious, was rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center, where he died five days later, cops said. His death was ruled a homicide, authorities said. Police were still looking for the suspects Thursday.
