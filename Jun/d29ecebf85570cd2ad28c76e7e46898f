Frantic passengers aboard a British Airways flight from London to Washington, DC, may have been wondering whether to grab their life jackets — after water cascaded into the cabin of the giant plane from the ceiling. The chaotic scene aboard Flight BA292, a double-decker Airbus A380 flying at 30,000 feet, on Friday was captured in video posted by the Sun. “No f—- way!” one flight attendant exclaims as the waterfall drenches the cabin shortly before the flight landed in DC. Soaking crew members placed rugs on the floor in a desperate effort to prevent the water from spreading throughout the rest of the cabin and possibly damaging electrical components. Passengers in the affected area bolted from their seats and made their way to dry areas of the aircraft. “This was not a flight for nervous fliers. An inflight waterfall is not a regular feature at BA. It looked more British Waterways than British Airways,” an airline employee told the Sun, adding that the “crew gave thanks the leak happened towards the end of the trans-Atlantic crossing.” The worker added: “There were a few people saying their Hail Marys, but staff were professional throughout.” The airline said the flood was the result of a faulty valve in the clean water supply aboard the superjumbo jet, which seats 500. “While there was no safety issue at any point, the area was quickly isolated and the flight continued as planned,” the rep told the Sun.
