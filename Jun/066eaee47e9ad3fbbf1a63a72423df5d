Trevor Lawrence and wife Marissa sealed their recent offseason vacation with a kiss. On Sunday, the wife of the Jaguars quarterback posted a collection of photos from the couple’s beach getaway with loved ones, where they shared a sweet embrace at the edge of the water. “Yeehaw for being on vacay,” Marissa captioned the post on Instagram. Days later, Marissa — who celebrated her first wedding anniversary with Lawrence in April — shared more snaps of the trip, noting on Instagram how “grateful” she is to spend time quality time with her family. “I never really talk about my family much on here but let me tell ya… they’re special. If you know my family dynamic at all then you know how rare it is. I’m grateful for the time we get and always finding a way to make memories. God really has been good to us and I’m forever grateful for it,” she wrote Wednesday. The trip comes after Lawrence, 22, took part in the Jaguars’ OTAs with first-year head coach Doug Pederson, who replaced Urban Meyer following his disastrous tenure in 2021. Pederson spoke to reporters last month about how the Jaguars will move forward in the wake of the Meyer fiasco, which included a laundry list of missteps both on and off the field that ultimately led to his firing in December. “I do believe there has to be some kind of healing with the situation and everything that transpired last year because … there’s a lack of trust that was broken, I think,” Pederson said. Pederson, who won a Super Bowl during his time as the Eagles’ head coach, added, “For me, it’s about gaining the trust back, and they’ve got to see it through me.” Lawrence’s relationship with Pederson got off to a sweet start in February, when last year’s first overall pick treated his new coach — and desserts aficionado — to some Haagen-Dazs ice cream for his introductory press conference. Before joining the Jaguars, Pederson coached the Eagles from 2016-20.
