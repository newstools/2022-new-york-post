While all the focus for the Knicks leading up to the free agency period circulated around Jalen Brunson, they were able to multitask. Just as free agency began, Stadium’s Shams Charania reported that the Knicks had agreed to terms with stretch center Isaiah Hartenstein on a fully-guaranteed two-year, $16 million contract. The 24-year-old, 7-footer averaged 8.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists last year. He has bounced around, playing for the Rockets, Nuggets, Cavaliers and Clippers, and was expected to receive interest from a lot of teams, most notably the Magic.

But the Knicks, who had created over $30 million of cap space by trading out of the first round and dealing veterans Alec Burks, Kemba Walker and Nerlens Noel, jumped in to land the versatile big man. It’s uncertain where this leaves Mitchell Robinson, who was reportedly expected to return. An NBA scout familiar with Hartenstein views him as a “high-level” backup. “Really high IQ player. Not an elite athlete but understands how to overcome his limitations,” the scout said. “One of the best passing centers in the NBA. Can run your offense through him at times. Hasn’t proven to be a consistent 3-point shooter.”
