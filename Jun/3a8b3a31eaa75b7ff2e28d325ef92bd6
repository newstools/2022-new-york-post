Sports conspiracy theorists, it’s your moment. During warmups ahead of Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Warriors players reportedly complained about the height of the hoop in Boston — and it turned out they were right. The team paused its pregame activity and asked officials to measure the height of the basket, which turned out to be higher than the 10 feet prescribed in the NBA rulebook. Despite Boston’s history of playing fast and loose with sports rules, everyone seemed to take the recertification of the baskets in stride ahead of the 9 p.m. Eastern tipoff with a series lead on the line. “It’s a good thing the game starts at midnight,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr joked to reporters when told about the basket. “We’ll have plenty of time to fix it.” A mis-heighted hoop is nothing new to Kerr. “It happens every once in a while,” he said. “Players have a really sharp eye for that, players can tell. As long as they take care of it, everything is good.” The Celtics do  have a history of tomfoolery dating back to former coach, GM and president Red Auerbach’s reign from 1950-2006. The late legend was oft accused of turning off hot water in the visitor’s locker room and engineering dead spots in floor. Officials also made the host Celtics pause to check the hoop at their end of the parquet floor. No word on if the inflation level of the balls was checked as well. Former Warriors star Andrew Bogut seemed to enjoy some extra intrigue in the series. “Love it by the @celtics,” he tweeted, “Shenanigans!”
