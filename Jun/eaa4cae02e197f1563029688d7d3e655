The Greenwich Village “Gold Coast” home of late US Attorney General Ramsey Clark has hit the market for $2.95 million. It’s the first time the two-bedroom, two-bath co-op has been on the market in more than 50 years. Clark was known for championing civil rights. But his transition from fighting for the powerless to defending war criminals like Slobodan Milosevic, dictators like Saddam Hussein, terrorists like Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and the Nazi boss of a concentration camp confounded many Americans. In the 1960s, Clark supervised the drafting of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. But Clark also prosecuted Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling young Americans to resist the draft during the Vietnam War. The co-op, at the Butterfield House, is at 37 W. 12th St. The second-floor home opens to a foyer that leads to a living room and dining room with bay windows. A long hallway leads to a bedroom wing facing the building’s back courtyard. The main bedroom boasts three large closets and an ensuite bath. The unit comes with new oak floors but the rest — including the kitchen and baths — needs work, so “bring your contractor,” the listing notes. The building dates to 1962. The listing brokers are Mark D. Friedman and Richard Rosenthal of Brown Harris Stevens.
