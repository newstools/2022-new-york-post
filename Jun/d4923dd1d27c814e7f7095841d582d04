A man stabbed his dad on Father’s Day in The Bronx — then held cops at bay before being taken into custody. The 31-year-old son allegedly attacked his father with “an unknown object” around 8:30 a.m. inside 1745 Dewey Ave. in Throggs Neck, police said. It was not immediately known what prompted the stabbing. The 59-year-old dad was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in stable condition, cops said. The son remained in the home after the violent incident as police tried to negotiate his surrender, cops said. The son eventually gave up, authorities said. Police did not identify either man and said charges against the son are pending.
