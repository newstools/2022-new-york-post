Michael Jordan lived his best life in Nashville over the weekend while checking out the Ally 400 NASCAR Cup Series. The Chicago Bulls legend, 59, made an appearance at the rooftop area of Layer Cake Social Kitchen, where his Cincoro Tequila brand hosted an event ahead of the race at the Nashville Speedway. In a video shared Tuesday by Sideaction.com, Jordan can be seen mingling with guests, and even appeared to dance briefly with a woman. Jordan, who owns and operates 23XI Racing, alongside three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, also posed for photos outdoors with fellow drivers Bubba Wallace and Kurt Busch. As the Charlotte Hornets owner continued to make the rounds in Nashville, he also met up with country music star Eric Church, whom he appeared to sip Cincoro Tequila with at the Graduate Hotel. Once the photos made their way onto social media, however, fans lost it over Jordan’s pitstop in Music City. “Man! MJ! EC! LEGENDARY!” one fan commented on Instagram while another replied, “I wanna meet MJ #bucketlist.” Elsewhere, one fan mourned his miss connection with Jordan. “Wait what?! @michaeljordan the REAL Air Jordan himself was in Nashville?!? How the hell did I miss this?!?”
