Is Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson on her way to becoming Wifey Boo Boo? The 16-year-old former “Toddlers & Tiaras” sensation is sparking engagement rumors because of a big diamond ring on her left ring finger. In images obtained by the US Sun, Thompson sported the sparkler while helping her 22-year-old sister, Lauryn “Pumpkin” Shannon, with her twin babies in Georgia at a recent photo shoot. However, Thompson’s rep told The Post, “Alana is not engaged.” Thompson has been dating 21-year-old college student Dralin Carswell since early 2021. While there is an age gap between the young-and-in-love couple, the legal age of consent in Georgia is 16, and Thompson turns 17 on Aug. 28. “She is getting a lot of hate because she’s in an interracial relationship [and] he is older,” Thompson’s estranged mother, Mama June, recently told TooFab. “At the end of the day, Alana’s not that 6-, 7-year-old child y’all fell in love with 11 years ago.” In Georgia, you need to be 18 to consent to marriage. But if you’re 17, you can marry if you’re emancipated and complete a premarital education course. The catch is your significant other can’t be more than four years older than you. Thompson is not emancipated: Pumpkin has full custody of her little sister after Mama June was arrested for possessing a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia in 2019. “A lot of folks in this world do not realize how many people are actually really affected by drug and alcohol [use] … It’s very, very hard,” she told Teen Vogue last year. “It’s something I’d wish on nobody, for real … When my mama got real bad with her [drug use], I didn’t know where I was going to end up. I’m proud of myself for how far I’ve come.” In the same interview, Thompson also spoke about how childhood fame affected who she chooses to have around her. “To be honest, I do not have many friends. At all,” she candidly admitted. “I don’t trust nobody really, so I don’t have friends.”
