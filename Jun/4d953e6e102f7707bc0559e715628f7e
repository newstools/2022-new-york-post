Rapper Roddy Ricch performed at Hot 97’s Summer Jam on Sunday — when he led the crowd in a “F–k the NYPD” chant just hours after gun possession charges against him were dropped in Queens. The Grammy-winning artist, whose real name is Rodrick Moore, had been busted at a security checkpoint outside the Governors Ball festival at Citi Field on Saturday night after a security guard found a loaded Canik 9mm stashed under the front passenger seat of the black 2020 Cadillac Escalade he was in. A large-capacity magazine that contained nine rounds of ammunition was also found, police sources said. Moore, 23, was arrested along with two other men in the car — Carlos Collins, 57, of New Jersey and Michael Figueroa, 46, of Brooklyn — and charged with felony gun possession raps, cops said. But the next morning, the “Die Young” performer was released and the charges against him and Collins dropped in a move that the Queens District Attorney’s Office and police refused to explain. Law-enforcement sources said the charges were dropped because prosecutors found Figueroa had the gun in his waistband and then stashed it under the front passenger seat of the car when a security guard asked to search the vehicle. “This is typical street stuff. … The ‘f–k the NYPD’ comments are typical,” a Manhattan detective with 20 years on the job told The Post on Tuesday. “The cops probably treated him great.” Another senior law-enforcement source groused, “Loaded illegal gun with extended mag in [the] car, but no big deal in New York City anymore. Let’s just apologize for wasting his time.” The bust prevented Moore from performing at Governors Ball, but he took the stage at the city radio station’s Summer Jam, where he led the expletive-laden chant for a few beats before launching into a song. The crowd obliged Moore’s chant and repeated “F–k the NYPD” a couple of times before the song began.
