After capping off a 5-2 homestand, the New York Mets embark on a five-game road trip with their first stop in Houston to take on the Astros in interleague play. Two right-handers will start in the series opener, as Trevor Williams gets the nod for the Mets while the Astros will counter with José Urquidy. There are some question marks surrounding both pitchers, and given the quality in each lineup, we’ll assess whether we can expect a high-scoring affair on Tuesday night. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: NYM +1.5 (-165) vs. HOU-1.5 (+140) Moneyline: NYM (+115) vs. HOU (-135) Total: Over 9 (-105) | Under 9 (-115) Trevor Williams (3.53) vs. José Urquidy (4.99) No matter which statistics you look at, chances are you’ll find the Mets and Astros within reach of one another. The Mets have the second-highest winning percentage (.652), with the Astros right behind at .621. New York also ranks second with a wRC+ of 114, just one higher than Houston’s value of 113. And while the Mets have done a better job hitting for average (.261) than the Astros (.238), Houston’s .175 ISO is 24% higher than that of the Mets (.141). Thus, when you look at those numbers, it’s hard not to expect both offenses to play a massive role in this matchup. Williams comes into this game at 1-3 with a 3.53 ERA and a 1.26 WHIP. Yet, despite those decent numbers, it’s hard to view him as more than a spot starter at this point in his career. There’s no question he’s filled in admirably following the injuries to the Mets’ rotation. While he’s likely to feel buoyant when pitching in front of his home crowd, I’m not sure bettors can be too comfortable backing him on the road. His 4.50 ERA away from home is more than two runs higher than when he pitches at Citi Field (2.30). Moreover, his head-to-head numbers against the Astros aren’t great, as Houston’s current lineup has a .304 BA with a .401 wOBA in 24 plate appearances. If we turn the spotlight to Urquidy’s numbers, we’ll find that the Mets’ offense could also be in line for a big day at the plate. This season, Urquidy has been the beneficiary of plenty of run support from the Astros. In his five wins, Houston averaged 8.6 runs in those games. As a result, his 5-3 record looks a bit overvalued considering his 4.99 ERA and 1.52 WHIP. His advanced numbers also don’t offer much relief, as evidenced by his 4.82 FIP and 6.16 xERA. Urquidy struggles with the long ball, given that his 1.76 HR/9 ratio is the highest of his career. And while this current Mets lineup has only 21 plate appearances against him, they boast a .421 BA with a .521 wOBA and a .630 xSLG. I took a look at Urquidy’s starts against some of the top offenses in the league. He’s had seven starts against teams ranked in the top-12 in wRC+, and his opponents are averaging 5.14 runs in those games. Now he’ll face a Mets team that’s lineup ranked second in wRC+. There’s been a lot written about the Astros’ 44-21-1 run to the under this season. However, according to our ActionLabs database, when the Astros are a home favorite with an opening total of nine, the under has yet to cash this season (0-3). I think this is an excellent spot for the over, and I’ll even buy some insurance by playing an alternate total of 8.5 at -130 odds. ALT total over 8.5 runs (-130) BetMGM
