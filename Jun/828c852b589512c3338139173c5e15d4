A 72-year-old cabbie was fleeing the scene of a crash with another taxi on the Upper East Side on Sunday morning when his car jumped the curb and crashed into a Chase Bank, sending scaffolding toppling to the ground, police said. There were no pedestrians injured when the car struck the bank at 79th Street and Third Avenue around 10:30 a.m. — but both cabbies were hospitalized, one in critical condition, police said. The driver of the scofflaw cab was fleeing the scene of his crash with a 62-year-old taxi driver at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue when he careened onto the sidewalk, police said. “He lost control of his vehicle when he was making a left turn onto Third Avenue,” a police spokeswoman said. “That’s how he jumped the curb.” The driver of the other taxi was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital with back pain. While at the hospital, he suffered cardiac arrest and remains in critical condition, cops said. The driver who fled the crash scene was taken to Cornell Hospital in police custody with charges pending, cops said. Photos of the crash show his taxi surrounded by scaffolding.
