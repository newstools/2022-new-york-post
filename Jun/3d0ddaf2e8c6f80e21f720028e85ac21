Elon Musk will attend an all-hands virtual Twitter meeting on Thursday and field questions from the company’s employees, according to reports. The meeting, first reported by Business Insider, marks the first time that the multi-billionaire will speak to Twitter workers since he launched his $44 billion bid to purchase the company in April. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed Musk’s attendance, Reuters reported. Staffers at the social media giant can begin submitting questions for Musk on Wednesday, Business Insider reported, citing an internal email from Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal. “We’ll cover topics and questions that have been raised over the past few weeks,” Agrawal said in the email to staffers, according to Insider. Since Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, announced his intention to buy Twitter, some workers have expressed dismay and concern. During an April meeting following Musk’s announcement, employees told executives they feared Musk’s erratic behavior could hurt the company’s bottom line, Reuters reported. They also wondered what their futures with the company could be under his leadership. Musk, at times, has lashed out at Twitter’s moderation practices, including stating the company should not have censored The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story before the 2020 election. Musk threatened to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter last week, though the company stated it planned to force the agreed terms. With Post wires
