Lebron James is ready to put his recently valued billion-dollar net worth to good use. The Lakers superstar revealed he’s looking to buy an NBA team – and already has the location set. “I want to own a team, I want to buy a team, for sure,” James said in a preview clip from the latest episode of his talk show, “The Shop: Uninterrupted,” which is set to air Friday. “I want a team in Vegas.” James, who currently acts as a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, Pittsburgh Penguins and Liverpool Football Club, has repeatedly expressed his interest in owning an NBA franchise, stating last season “it will be sooner than later.” The four-time NBA MVP will be entering his 20th season this upcoming fall and would have to end his playing career before being eligible to purchase a team. Despite a recent influx of professional teams to Vegas, including franchises such as the Golden Knights, Raiders and Aces, NBA commissioner Adam Silver reiterated before Game 1 of the NBA Finals that the league has no plans of expanding in the foreseeable future. “We are not discussing that at this time,” Silver said. “As I said before, at some point, this league invariably will expand, but it’s not at this moment that we are discussing it.” For now, James will likely have to put his dreams of owning a Sin City basketball team on hold. But if the superstar has shown anything over his extraordinary career, it’s his ability to turn longshot dreams into reality.
