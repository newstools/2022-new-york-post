A Georgia sheriff’s deputy has been arrested for raping a woman while on duty, authorities said Wednesday. Walker County Deputy Jerry Glover, 81, was taken into custody Tuesday on charges of rape, violation of oath of office and false imprisonment, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced. The LaFayette Police Department requested the state agency to help investigate the reported sexual assault of a woman by a Walker County sheriff’s deputy on May 11. “The investigation revealed that Glover had sex with a woman without her consent while on duty and in uniform,” GBI officials said in a statement. “This investigation is active and ongoing.” The alleged attack occurred last month, a GBI spokeswoman told The Post. She said she had no additional information to provide. Glover, who worked as a court officer, allegedly pulled up to the victim’s home and forced her to have sex inside the residence before returning to service, Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson told WTVC. Glover, of Rock Spring, was fired from his post on Friday, The Chattanoogan reported. The accused deputy was denied bond during a court appearance early Wednesday and is set to return on June 9 for a bond hearing, according to the Rome News-Tribune.
