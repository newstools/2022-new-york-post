How many memories do you have of your dad with the volume cranked up and his favorite albums playing? As Father’s Day gets closer, you can give your dad a gift that lets him play the music he loves, and maybe you can sit down with him and enjoy it too. The Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable with Bluetooth Speaker is the perfect gift for your music-loving dad, and for a limited time it’s $279.99 (Reg. $369). Order soon and it’ll be here in time for Father’s Day. The Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable is a beautiful combination of retro look and function with some modern amenities. It’s a manual, belt-driven turntable like the classics, but it also has a built-in Bluetooth speaker.  It has the look and feel of a model your dad might have seen or owned, but it’s also got modern noise-reduction, improved tracking, and a sub-chassis mechanism built to limit low-frequency acoustic feedback that makes your vinyl sound staticy. A turntable like this is the perfect reason for your dad to pull out his favorite vinyls this Father’s Day, and for you to share in that too. Even if your old man has gone digital, he can use this to start collecting and playing music like he used to hear it. One reviewer put it simply, “Looks classy. Sound is great for the price.” Your dad will love being able to enjoy music authentically, and he’ll probably appreciate that you got it on sale too. And if he wants to listen by himself, he can throw on some headphones. This Father’s Day, you can give your music-loving dad a way to authentically enjoy his favorite tunes again. Order soon and get the Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable with Bluetooth Speaker for $279.99 (Reg. $379) just in time for Father’s Day. Prices subject to change.
