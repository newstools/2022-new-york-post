Georgia Rose receives up to 200 messages a day from suspicious girlfriends asking for her help. The 20-year-old TikToker has begun using her platform to aid women determine their partners’ loyalty. In just a month, she’s caught about a dozen unfaithful boyfriends. “I’ve been cheated on before, so I know what these girls are going through,” Rose — who has 34,000 TikTok followers — told the Daily Star. Rose, who based in the U.K., is the latest digital sleuth using social media to help expose bad boyfriends, joining Instagram model Paige Woolen and Playboy cover star Carolina Lekker, who charges a whopping $2,000 to “honeytrap” would-be cheaters on Instagram. Rose subjects suspects to a “loyalty test.” Women reach out to her with their concerns. Then, for an undisclosed fee, she’ll slide into their partner’s DMs to start a conversation that will either prove or disprove their devotion. Once her job is done, she quickly blocks the boyfriend on social media. The results have been grim. So far, only seven or eight out of the 20 men she’s tested have proved loyal. Rose recalled a pregnant woman reaching out to her about the father of her baby. During the test, the boyfriend said he was in a relationship but added, “I don’t see any harm in getting to know each other.” That was enough proof to convince the pregnant woman that her boyfriend was guilty.  “She had her gender reveal the next day, and it was heartbreaking for her,” Rose told the Daily Star. “She said it was enough for her to end [the relationship], and the next day she told me the gender of the baby which was sweet of her.” Despite the heartbreak involved in the aftermath, the women are grateful for her help — sometimes even ecstatic. As one happy customer told her after Rose exposed her boyfriend of five years as a “waste of space”: “I’m no longer with him, and I will be living up hot girl summer.”
