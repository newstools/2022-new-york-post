Actress Mary Mara, who died Sunday, was confirmed to have died by asphyxiation due to water. An autopsy performed by the Jefferson County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday confirmed police’s initial belief of drowning. “The Jefferson County Medical Examiner’s Office performed a post-mortem examination of the decedent and determined that the decedent’s manner of death was an accident, due to asphyxiation, due to warm water drowning,” said NYSP Public Information Officer Jack Keller. The 61-year-old actress’s rep Craig Dorfman told the family Tuesday that investigators found that Mara might have slipped and hit her head following her swim in Cape Vincent, New York, judging by face abrasions. Police are still trying to determine what object the “Mr. Saturday Night” star hit that rendered her unconscious or immobile. Investigators say that after swimming in the St. Lawrence river, the “Love Potion No. 9” star slipped and hit her head, causing her to fall back into the water and drown. New York State Police troopers responded to a call of a possible drowning a little after 8 a.m. local time on Sunday, according to a report. “Mary was one of the finest actresses I ever met,” said Dorfman. “I still remember seeing her onstage in 1992 in ‘Mad Forest’ off-Broadway. She was electric, funny and a true individual. Everyone loved her. She will be missed.” Family members say that Mara was reportedly staying at her sister’s summer home, which fronts the St. Lawrence River. Mara has starred in several TV shows such as  “Nash Bridges,” “ER,” “Criminal Minds,” “The West Wing,” “Shameless,” “Lost,” “Dexter,” “Star Trek: Enterprise” and “Ray Donovan.” She leaves behind an ex-husband and a stepdaughter.
