An Orlando woman has a good reason to be wary of wildlife after a raccoon chased her and her Yorkie into her house. Nykeria Clark was walking her dog, Jojo, when the feisty raccoon attacked as they returned to their Florida residence. In security-camera footage posted to TikTok, which has been viewed more than 10 million times, the woman and her small pup are seen running up to the front door. As they approached the door to go inside, the raccoon, which had been in hot pursuit, lunged toward the dog and followed them into the home. “I was basically in like a panic mode, so at that point, I tried to find whatever I could find,” Clark told 7 News Miami. “I got a mop, and I tried to scare it off with a mop, and then once I scared it off with a mop, it hid in the blinds.” Clark said she called animal services, which then took an hour to get to her home. When they arrived, the raccoon was perched on top of the window shutter. The worried pet owner said she took her dog to the vet the same day to get a rabies shot. “Health services called and informed me that the lab results from the raccoon came back negative,” Clark updated worried followers in a TikTok comment. “My dog [has been] released from quarantine.” TikTok users were horrified by the woman’s raccoon encounter, shocked by its bold assumption that it was invited inside. “Man the way the door would have shut behind me instantly,” one woman wrote. “That’s traumatizing for real!” another user wrote. “Smh I pray that you’re both going to be OK!” Others praised the pup for protecting Clark from the raccoon. “Your baby was tryna protect you too!” one TikTok user exclaimed. “He deserves all the kisses and loves…. raccoons are ruthless.”
