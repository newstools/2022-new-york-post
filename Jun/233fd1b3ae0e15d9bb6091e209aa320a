Cheeky online critics pounced Saturday after President Biden took a spill off his bicycle, posting countless memes spoofing the presidential pratfall. “Let the bike memes begin,” tweeted Catturd, a popular conservative memester, within minutes of Biden’s embarrassing, but not serious morning tumble during a ride near his Rehoboth Beach, Del. vacation home  — and hundreds of followers quickly responded. One Twitter user slapped the logo for LifeAlert, the emergency alert system for seniors, and its famous catchphrase — “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” — on a photo of Biden down on the pavement. Another made a spliced-together video suggesting that a golf ball to Biden’s helmeted head — sent his way by former President Trump — had made him topple, reminiscent of a similar 2017 meme that cast Hillary Clinton as Trump’s target. Many played off the popular meme of a bicyclist who pushes a stick into his own wheel’s spokes, causing an inevitable fall. “Putin’s gravity hike!” went one caption to the image. “Dang it Putin” read another — both tweaking Biden’s penchant for blaming the Russian leader for the nation’s economic woes.
