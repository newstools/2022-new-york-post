While we love a Rolodex of retailers for online shopping, one thing is for sure — there’s nothing more unique than Anthropologie. Not only unique but show-stopping, too, is the brand’s top-rated Gleaming Primrose Mirror. It has been the backdrop for several influencers’ #OOTD selfies on Instagram (more on that below) and is bound to receive an influx of compliments from any home visitor. Now, Anthropologie’s pride and joy is on sale for the first time ever since its 2011 launch — a huge dela! Specifically, you’ll receive 30% off all Primrose Products, from the top-rated mirror to its beautiful Gleaming Primrose Triptych Mirror (now $349) and more. “The Gleaming Primrose Mirror was inspired by French Antique Gilt Mirrors seen throughout Paris,” Louie Higaki, general merchandise manager of AnthroLiving, shared with the New York Post. “It came to life in 2011 and has been a customer favorite ever since.” Related: the best Anthropologie mirror dupes. As the years have evolved, so has the mirror with new shapes and finishes. “The mirror is a style chameleon adding drama to any architectural aesthetic retaining her star of the show status within AnthroLiving,” Higaki adds. For its flagship mirror style, it comes in four different sizes — from 3-ft to 7-ft large — and is available in gold, antique black, silver and verdigris. So, whatever your room’s aesthetic looks like, this mirror is still a perfect fit. What’s more, the Gleaming Primrose mirror remains Anthropologie’s most-viewed product on its Instagram Shop with more than 120K page views and 23K page clicks to its site. With rave reviews — “A MUST!” “Worth the hype! “brb in heaven…” — it’s no surprise this first-ever sale is one for the books. Plus, there’s a list of influencers and celebrities who adore it, from Shay Mitchell and Jillian Harris to Andy Benavides and Nabela Noor.
