Two teenagers were indicted Friday for the broad-daylight murder of 11-year-old Kyhara Tay — who was struck by a stray bullet allegedly fired by one of the suspects in the Bronx last month, prosecutors said. Omar Bojang, 18, was driving a moped on Westchester Avenue on May 16 when his passenger, Matthew Godwin, 15, allegedly fired multiple shots intended for a 13-year-old boy, authorities said. The suspects missed their target, with the stray bullet instead fatally striking Tay. The pair was arraigned Friday before Bronx Supreme Court Justice Naita Semaj-Williams on charges of  second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter, attempted murder and attempted assault in the first degree. Godwin was also charged with two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. Both are being remanded without bail and are due back in court on Aug. 17. Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark called the case “a catastrophe of our young people.” “These ages make you weep. As I keep saying, we are losing a generation in the Bronx and we must act now to save our young people,” Clark said in a statement.
