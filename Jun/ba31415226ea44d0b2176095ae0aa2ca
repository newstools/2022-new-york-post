Just when you think you’ve seen it all, New York City’s bonkers real estate market delivers. Pegged as a “West Village Diamond In The Rough renovation project,” a quaint two-bedroom, two-bathroom co-op has hit the market for $1.5 million. At first sight, the apartment seems pretty ordinary. It features a decent size living area, a cozy kitchen with a high top kitchen table, two small, but fairly comfortable bedrooms, and a nice powder room. The problem? You have to go inside a closet to bathe yourself. Photos show the shower head situated next to the kitchen and accessed through a shuttered sliding closet door. There are no windows. A plus is being able to smell a roasting chicken while you shower. If that sounds like a hot, wet mess for $1.5 million, that because the listing is actually for two side-by-side apartments seperated by a small hallway. “This is the canvas you’ve been waiting for if you’re one of the many people that ‘WANT A GUT RENOVATION PROJECT,'” the listing appropriately notes. “Bring your imagination and bring your designer… not to mention (okay I know I already mentioned it) the location!!” “It’s not everyday that an opportunity to create your dream two bedroom apartment in a dream location comes around.” Located on the top floor of a walk up building, which ambitiously touted as the “penthouse floor,” features include light, wood floors and views of the tree-lined West 10th Street. Building amenities include a roof deck, laundry and a bicycle room, and comes with a live in super. But don’t even think about washing your dog in that handy kitchen shower: The listing explains that only cats are allowed. Steven Clair with Compass holds the listing.
