Finding the giraffe without a twin in this optical illusion could be a tall order. Today’s brain teaser features a total of 19 cartoon giraffes out on safari in the proverbial wild kingdom. One is standing by a tree — while another is befriending a butterfly. Some of the long-necked species are facing each other — although one keeps to themselves by chomping on some leafy cartoon foliage. The key to solving the teaser is to pay attention to each giraffe’s eyes, markings, and stature to determine which outlier does not have an identical-looking buddy. Ready for the answer? [Warning: Spoilers below] The giraffe that does not have a twin is on the right side of the photo in the third row, third from the left. Too confusing? Peep the image at the bottom of the page. If you didn’t get this one, there are plenty of others to try. On Thursday, we attempted to find a celeb’s portrait hidden in this illusion. You’d be in the top 1 percent if you can spot the obscured star hiding among the series of dots. Plus, you can try to spot the cat hidden in this optical illusion. Meanwhile, this fruity brain teaser is testing what color strawberries people see tells viewers if their eyes — and brain — are in denial. Although optical illusions are usually just a little diversion from the stresses of a typical day fun — they also hold real-life value for scientists. The brain teasers reportedly help researchers shed light on the inner machinations of the mind — and how it reacts to its surroundings. Dr Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at Goldsmiths University in London, told The Sun that such illusions are actually important to increasing our understanding of the brain: “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you.”
