A Queens high school teacher was busted this week for allegedly sending explicit text messages to a female student, authorities said. Shannon Hall, 31, who teaches at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences on Gothic Drive in Jamaica Hills, was arrested just before 6 p.m. Thursday and accused of sending the inappropriate texts to a 16-year-old girl, cops said. The messages caused the student “annoyance and alarm,” cops said. Hall was charged with endangering the welfare of a child and aggravated harassment, police said. “This alleged behavior is completely unacceptable and will be fully investigated,” a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said in a statement. “This employee has been reassigned away from the school and students pending the outcome of the arrest and if convicted, we will pursue his termination. There is nothing more important than the safety and well-being of our students.”
