Celebrity hairstylist Nick Arrojo and his wife Lina are in contract to buy a home at One Wall Street, the Art Deco landmark in Fidi designed by architect Ralph Walker and developed by Harry Macklowe. The three-bedroom unit is 1,804 square feet. It’s in contract for around $4.4 million. It features French oak hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, an entry lined with closets and a main bedroom with a spa-like bath. The building, originally the Irving Trust, is between the New York Stock Exchange and Trinity Church, which is Alexander Hamilton’s final resting place. Amenities include a 38th-floor gym with a 75-foot lap pool overlooking downtown Manhattan and the harbor, along with a private restaurant on the 39th floor, and a 4,000-square-foot landscaped terrace. In addition, there’s a private co-working space, a children’s play room, teen lounge, private storage and more. Arrojo’s long-time broker Jason Walker, of Douglas Elliman, also bought a unit. Both are in the glass-loft section of the building. The Arrojos, repped by Walker, had sold their Tribeca home, at 505 Greenwich St. for around $4.4 million in 2020.
