A box of loaded guns were found at a Parkland, Florida school Thursday, several miles away from the site of the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas mass shooting, reports said. The weapons belonged to Somerset Academy Principal Geyler Castro, officials at the charter school told parents in a Friday letter, according to WPLG-TV. Castro brought a closed box containing two firearms into the school; they were found unattended by officials in a locked room, the station reported. “No one intended to bring a weapon into the building. The box was among many items brought into the locked room from the principal’s vehicle,” the school’s board said, following a police investigation. It is a felony to carry a gun into a school building in Florida. It was unclear if prosecutors would file charges against Castro, who had not issued a statement, the station said. Somerset Academy is less than three miles from Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed and 17 others were injured by a former student in 2018.
