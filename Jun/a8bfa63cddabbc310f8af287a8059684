A former NYPD cop who “recklessly” fired off a gun into the ocean while drinking with friends on Long Island was sentenced to prison Thursday. Judge Robert Bogle handed down a 16-month to four-year prison sentence to 41-year-old David Afanador for criminal possession of a firearm, Nassau County District Attorney said. “This defendant knew he could not legally possess a firearm, but still made the decision to drink with friends on a beach and recklessly fire a loaded gun several times into the ocean,” Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly said. “Afanador’s behavior was foolish, dangerous, and illegal. We hope that his sentence sends a message to anyone thinking about illegally discharging a weapon in Nassau County in the name of fun.” Afanador shot seven rounds from a .9mm Beretta into the ocean in Long Beach on March 21, 2021, while drinking a hard seltzer with friends, authorities said. When cops arrived they found Afanador, who was holding the spiked drink, with the semi-automatic pistol holstered, and they said he was carrying two load magazines. Afanador was on modified duty, which prohibited him from carrying a firearm, at the time after being criminally charged in a violent arrest that was captured on video. The former cop, the first officer charged under the state’s ban on police chokeholds, was later cleared of criminal strangulation charges after a Queens grand jury declined to hand up an indictment.
