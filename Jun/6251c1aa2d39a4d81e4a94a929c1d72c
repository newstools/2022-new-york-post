USA Today said it has deleted 23 articles from its website after an investigation found that the reporter who wrote them used fabricated sources. The journalist who is said to have used the fabricated sources was identified as Gabriela Miranda, a breaking news reporter who resigned from the Virginia-based newspaper weeks ago, the paper confirmed Thursday. Miranda’s most recent news story for USA Today is dated April 17. According to the bio on her website, Miranda was assigned to cover “trending news nationwide” while at USA Today. Before being hired by USA Today, she covered education and the Hispanic community with the Gainesville Times in Georgia. The Post has reached out to USA Today’s parent company Gannett as well as Miranda seeking comment. Miranda has deleted her LinkedIn account. The Times obtained a draft of the note that read: “After receiving an external correction request, USA Today audited the reporting work of Gabriela Miranda.” “The audit revealed that some individuals quoted were not affiliated with the organizations claimed and appeared to be fabricated,” the note read. “The existence of other individuals quoted could not be independently verified. In addition, some stories included quotes that should have been credited to others.” USA Today will reportedly tell its readers that it will review its processes “to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.” The paper pledged that it will “improve our process for those who want to lodge complaints or request corrections.” It will also “ensure stories have clear and sufficient identifying information for individuals quoted.” USA Today also vowed to “ensure that institutions are contacted to provide a response or statement if they are referenced in the story” and to make sure “reporters take appropriate steps at all times to verify source information.” USA Today is among the most widely circulated national newspapers in the country.
