New York voters will see all three 2022 Democratic gubernatorial candidates square off for the first time Tuesday at a televised debate airing at 7 p.m. on CBS 2 from the CBS Broadcast Center. Gov. Kathy Hochul has built a formidable war chest while leading all public polling in her race against lefty Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and moderate US Rep. Tom Suozzi from Nassau County. But polling has suggested Hochul might be vulnerable if either of her challengers gets a breakout moment.
