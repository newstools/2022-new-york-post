With six weeks to go before the trade deadline, here are a few stats to remember: 1. A .226 batting average with a .704 OPS.2. A 4.93 ERA. The hitting stats were the combined efforts of Adam Duvall, Joc Pederson, Eddie Rosario and Jorge Soler before they were traded last season to the Braves. The pitching stat was Clay Holmes’ ERA with the Pirates in 2021, which — believe it or not — lowered his career mark to 5.57.
