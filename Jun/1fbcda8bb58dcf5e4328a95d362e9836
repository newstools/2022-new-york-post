A West Hollywood penthouse has quietly and unofficially hit the market for $50 million — in a building that was 10 years in the making. A second penthouse on the same floor at 8899 Beverly can be thrown in for $100 million-plus to create what brokers say could be the country’s largest single-floor penthouse — a true steel-and-glass mansion in the sky, with panoramic views from Beverly Hills to the Hollywood Hills, the San Gabriel Mountains and Malibu. Designer Tom Ford has recently toured the building, sources say, and loved it. “As someone who appreciates design and craftsmanship, he loved the quality of the building — and the privacy,” the source said. The boutique condo, from Townscape Partners, dates to the 1962 and was redesigned by New York- and Seattle-based architects Olson Kundig, whose clients include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This is Olson Kundig’s first residential condo project. The building was widened and enlarged to include townhouses and the penthouses, among other things. The penthouse features 6,451 square feet of interior luxury plus 1,489 square feet of outdoor space as well as parking and a private elevator landing for a total of close to 10,000 square feet. It was staged by ASH out of New York. Douglas Elliman listing broker Fredrik Eklund held a dinner launch at the penthouse attended by the Agency’s Mauricio Umansky, who is married to Kyle Richards of “RHOBH.” The four-bedroom, 4½-bath penthouse features stone and wood-paneled walls, 14-foot ceilings, glass window walls — some that are motorized and open to the terrace — and a large great room. Building amenities include security, a pool, hot tub, gym, a yoga studio, a 2,000-square-foot landscaped common area with an outdoor fireplace, two seating areas, a dog park and a grill area.
