Biz really was nasty looking this time. Former NHLer and current TNT host and Barstool Sports podcaster Paul Bissonnette let a seven-month old bet bite him back big time — and it led to one of the worst haircuts you’ll ever see. Back in November, Bissonnette and fellow “Spittin’ Chiclets” podcast host Ryan Whitney wagered over the Battle of Alberta — or games between the Oilers and Flames. If Calgary went further in the playoffs, Whitney would pierce his ear and wear a “Barry Bonds” cross earring for a month straight. If Edmonton lasted longer, Bissonnette would have to get a “Peter Mansbiz” haircut — shaving the top of one’s head but leaving the sides intact. Well, after the Oilers topped the Flames in five games in the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, it was time for Bissonnette to own up. And sure enough during Game 3 of the Western Conference Final, the former winger got his cut from Whitney — a former Oilers defenseman. And it was, well, something. In front of a raucous Oilers crowd, Bissonnette got the top of his dome shaved. During the original bet in November, Bissonnette tried to push for the cut to happen after the season was over. “TNT has to be over — I can’t go on TNT,” he pleaded. But Whitney wasn’t having any of it, and the wager would include a TV appearance with the haircut. And sure enough, Bissonnette went live during Game 3’s intermission with his new look. The comparisons ranged from George Costanza from “Seinfeld” and the classic magnetic toy Wolly Willy. Though the haircut is ridiculous, Bissonnette might get the last laugh now that the Oilers are in a 3-0 hole in their series against the Avalanche. Colorado defeated Edmonton, 4-2, in Game 3 on Saturday night.
