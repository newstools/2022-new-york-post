JoJo Siwa and Jesse Tyler Ferguson are set to enter Wildcat territory with guest roles in Season 3 of “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” A trailer for the third season, which dropped Wednesday, shows the gang heading to Camp Shallow Blue for two weeks, with a high-stakes production of “Frozen” teased for the end of the camp — competitiveness, drama and romance ensured. Newly recoupled Siwa, 19, who was a runner-up in “Dancing With the Stars” Season 30, will play Madison, a Camp Shallow Lake alum. Ferguson, 46, who starred in “Modern Family” and recently won his first-ever Tony for Broadway’s “Take Me Out” revival, will play Marvin, an old family friend of Olivia Rodrigo’s character Nini. Also set to make guest appearances are “High School Musical” movie alum Corbin Bleu — playing himself — as well as Meg Donnelly from “Zombies” as Val, a counselor in training, and Jason Earles from “Hannah Montana,” playing camp counselor Dewey Wood. Season 3 will feature music from other Disney films, including “the “Camp Rock” and the “High School Musical”  franchises, according to TV Line. “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” Season 3 premieres July 27 on Disney+.
