This inquisition turned out to be a real “Situation.” Convicted felon Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino was grilled by a priest before he could get approval to film his son Romeo’s baptism in church for “Jersey Shore Family Vacation.” Before he started diaper duty, he served eight months in prison for tax evasion, and the church looked into his past before it gave its blessing. “I had to go through many interviews with the church and the priest to actually have them allow me to film,” Sorrentino told The Post this week of the christening, which airs Thursday on Season 5 of “Jersey Shore Family Vacation.” “I had to go to at least two interviews and they probably did a little background check on me over the past couple of years and where I am in my life and my family, and they approved of me and my family and we moved forward,” said the 39-year-old, who tied the knot with his college sweetheart Lauren in 2018. “So I was very happy because a baptism is the first experience or introduction to God and I was happy to film that,” he said. Before his son was anointed a member of the faithful, the first-time father gave his newborn these words of advice earlier in the season: “First rule in the game is always do your taxes. Uncle Sam will come get you three years later.” The sacrament took place in December, at the Church of St. Catharine in Holmdel, New Jersey, where the Sorrentinos live in a $1.8 million-dollar home. That same month the former partier celebrated his sixth year of sobriety. During the sacred ceremony, the priest asked the doting parents and godparents the standard question, “Do you believe in the forgiveness of sins?” In his confessional segment immediately following, Sorrentino looked into the camera and said, “I love that part.”
