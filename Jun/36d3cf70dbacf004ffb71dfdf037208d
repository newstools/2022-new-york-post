Marion Barber, a former running back for the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears, was found dead in his apartment in Texas, according to multiple reports. According to the the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, which broke the news, a cause of death was not immediately clear. Barber would have celebrated his 39th birthday next week. “We are heartbroken by the tragic death of Marion Barber III,” the Cowboys said in a statement. “Marion was an old-school, hard-nosed football player who ran with the will to win every down. He had a passion for the game and love for his coaches and teammates. “Our hearts go out to Marion’s family and friends during this difficult time.” Barber, a Pro Bowler in 2007 with the Cowboys, was known for his particularly ferocious and punishing brand of running. He played for the Cowboys from 2005 through 2010, and for the Bears in 2011. In his career, he carried the ball 1,156 times for 4,780 yards and 53 touchdowns. Barber retired from the NFL and struggled in his post-playing career. He was detained for a mental health evaluation in 2014. In 2019, he was arrested for criminal mischief stemming from a 2018 incident in which he was accused by a witness of running towards a vehicle and causing dents.
