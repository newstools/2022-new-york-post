Brooks Koepka is tipping his hat to wife Jena Sims for planning an epic destination wedding. When speaking to reporters Tuesday during his US Open media session, the 32-year-old golfer opened up about the couple’s nuptials that recently took place in Turks and Caicos. “Jena did all the planning for that, I gave my opinion when necessary,” Koepka said, adding  that Sims, 33, “did a hell of a job.” Sims, who posted Koepka’s wedding-centric interview on her Instagram Story, quipped, “Don’t lie @bkoepka,” along with two winky face emojis. Koepka and Sims tied the knot earlier this month after announcing their engagement last spring. The longtime couple — who started dating in 2017 — celebrated alongside family and friends and even danced the night away with rapper Ludacris. “Best. Day. Of. My. Life,” Koepka gushed of the affair in an Instagram post. Though Koepka gave much of the wedding planning credit to Sims, the Steve Madden collaborator previously told The Post that the golfer was involved in the process. “He’s been on all the Zooms, because we have Zooms with the local florist, the hotel, and he’s been there for everything,” Sims told us in April. “It’s fun to be a teammate with him on this.” While Koepka competes for what would be his third US Open title this week, Sims is chasing a dream of her own. Last week, she released her submission video for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit‘s casting call in hopes of being featured in a future issue. “Your dreams don’t chase you back!” Sims exclaimed on TikTok. “Submitting for my dream job.”
