It might be easier to explain football to an alien than it is to convince a Jets fan what rookie receivers really are capable of. As NFL rookie receiving records get challenged or broken at a feverish pace, it takes combining the first-year totals of the last four receivers drafted by the Jets — Elijah Moore, Denzel Mims, Ardarius Stewart and Chad Hansen — to reach numbers in that zip code. There’s plenty of reason for skepticism. Enter Garrett Wilson, who joins the NFL one season after the rookie records for receptions (104 by the Dolphins’ Jaylen Waddle) and receiving yards (1,455 by the Bengals’ Ja’Marr Chase) were reset. Chase took the record from the Vikings’ Justin Jefferson, who held it for just 364 days. As the second receiver drafted — No. 10 overall, behind the Falcons’ Drake London at No. 8 — those benchmarks shouldn’t feel unrealistic to the 6-foot, 192-pound Wilson.
