A man from Portugal and a Brooklyn woman were busted for spray painting graffiti on subway cars in Queens, the NYPD said Thursday. Hugo Guerreiro, 39, and Alexis Gines, 32, were stopped around 2 a.m. Wednesday after cops responded to a 911 call about graffiti on subway trains at the 75th Avenue Subway Station in Forest Hills, police said. The NYPD’s Citywide Vandals Task Force investigated and recovered two duffel bags that were thrown under vehicles, police said. The bags “contained 15 cans of spray paint matching the paint used to make the graffiti,” police said. A police scanner was recovered from the Gines. Guerreiro and Gines were charged with criminal mischief, making graffiti, reckless endangerment, criminal mischief with intent to damage property, possession of graffiti instruments and criminal trespass, police said. Guerreiro flew in from Portugal on June 20, a police source said. The trains that were tagged were being stored in a tunnel. The two were also caught on camera leaving the train station with the duffel bags, according to the police source. The graffiti done by the two appeared to be gold bubble letters with a bright green background. “You better work on your art a little,” one police source joked.
