He’s such a “Sweet Creature.” Harry Styles paused his concert at Emirates Old Trafford in England on Wednesday to try and locate his first school teacher, Mrs. Vernon. “I’m going to ask a favor from you because I’d like to try and find someone in the audience,” the 28-year-old Brit told the stadium that holds 26,000 fans. “So, we’re going to get really quiet and I’m going to see if I can locate this person if you don’t mind helping me.” The crowd obliged, except for one rowdy bunch. “You’re not Mrs. Vernon,” Styles told the attention-seeking section. “There she is,” he quickly exclaimed, looking up to the rafters and dropping to his knees in gratitude. “How are you?” he asked. “I hear you’re retiring.” “I’d just like to thank you for everything in those formative years and, yeah, thank you so much. It means a lot to me that you’re here tonight,” he said, causing fans to audibly swoon over his sincerity. The kind gesture translated online, too. “Teaching can be such a thankless job sometimes, Harry; you proved otherwise,” one commenter said on CBS News’ video. “From teachers everywhere, thanks, Harry! This was so sweet,” another wrote. “I wonder if she’s proud of him,” another joked. The wholesome content comes after a 20-year-old male fan fell from a top-tier balcony at Styles’ show in Glasgow, Scotland. He was taken to a hospital but is recovering. Also Wednesday, the former boy bander sent fans into a frenzy following the release of a teaser trailer for his forthcoming film “My Policeman.” The romantic drama sees Styles play a married cop who embarks on a gay affair with a museum curator in 1950s England. The 60-second trailer — which racked up more than 115,000 views in just a few hours — shows the “Watermelon Sugar” singer steaming up the screen with male co-star David Dawson as their characters try to conceal their scandalous same-sex relationship.
