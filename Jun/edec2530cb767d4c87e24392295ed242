Professional wrestling legend Jeff Hardy has been arrested for alleged DUI in Florida. Volusia County jail records show Hardy was booked at 12:45 a.m. on Monday and charged with DUI alcohol/drugs third offense within 10 years, and driving with a suspended or revoked license. He’s being held on a $3,500 bond. Hardy, 44, currently wrestles in All Elite Wrestling. He and his brother, Matt, were scheduled for a ladder match with the Young Bucks and Jurassic Express for this Wednesday’s episode of “AEW Dynamite.” Hardy has had long-documented struggles with substance addiction. It is Hardy’s third impaired driving offense in five years. He was arrested for DWI in 2019 and was also arrested for driving while impaired after a car accident in 2018. He was also arrested for public intoxication in 2019. Hardy was released from WWE last December after an incident in which he bizarrely exited through the crowd during a match at an untelevised house show. As The Post reported at the time, WWE decided to release Hardy after they offered to send him to rehab, but he declined. ESPN reports that Hardy has a court date set for Tuesday afternoon.
