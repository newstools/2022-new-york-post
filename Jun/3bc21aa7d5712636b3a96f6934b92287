Gun violence in the Big Apple dropped last month by nearly a third compared to the same time last year — but shootings still remain nearly double pre-pandemic levels for this second straight month, NYPD data released Friday shows. The drop in gun violence comes as other major categories of crime ticked up in May. Police recorded 118 shootings in May 2022, down from 172 in 2021, data shows. Despite the dip, last month’s tally was up significantly from May 2019, before the surge in gun violence that plagued the city since the early weeks of COVID, when 61 shootings were logged. Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell credited the NYPD’s new Neighborhood Safety Teams, which have taken 105 guns off the streets since March, and other units for making a record number of firearm busts. “We have pointed every resource we have at reducing gun violence in this city. We have seen seven straight weeks of shootings going down — and that is not a coincidence,” Sewell said. The NYPD has repeatedly touted its high number of gun arrests in its effort to curb the surge in shootings, but since the stepped-up enforcement, which started under Bill de Blasio in 2020, many months have recorded both high firearm collars and shootings. Index crime in NYC was up 27.8% last month with grand larcenies rising by more than 42% compared to last year, 4,116 vs. 2,897, NYPD data shows. Robberies were up 26.2% from 1,193 to 1,506 and burglaries up 28.4% from 966 to 1,239. Over 2,500 more index crimes were reported last month compared to May 2019, according to the data.
