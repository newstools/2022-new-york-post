A 15-year-old boy was busted in connection to the deadly shooting of another Bronx teen last month, cops said. The boy was linked to the May 10 murder of Jason Perez, 17, and was picked up by the Bronx Warrants Squad around 1 p.m. Wednesday, police said. He was charged with murder and manslaughter, cops said. Shortly before he was killed, Perez was inside a bodega on Ogden Avenue near West 170th Street in Highbridge with his girlfriend when five males entered, authorities said. Once Perez walked out, the group followed, cops said. One man waiting outside suddenly punched him, authorities said. Then another person in the group opened fire, striking Perez in the chest around 8:15 p.m., police said. Police were unable to confirm Thursday morning whether the 15-year-old is believed to be the person who fired the fatal shot. Perez was taken to Lincoln Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, police said. The shooting appeared to be gang-related, authorities said.
