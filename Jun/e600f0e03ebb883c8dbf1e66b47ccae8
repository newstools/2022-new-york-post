Danish tennis player Holger Rune isn’t the only member of his family who had a breakout moment at the French Open. Alma Rune, the model sister of the 19-year-old athlete, captured the media’s attention Monday during Rune’s fourth-round victory against fourth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3. 6-4. Cameras panned to the Scoop Models stunner at Stade Roland Garros, with much of Twitter chiming in. “The fight of who will get more screen time Rune’s sister or Stefanos’ dad,” one user wrote. Egyptian sports journalist Reem Abulleil shared, “Haven’t seen a broadcast this obsessed with one single figure in the stands as this director has been with Rune’s sister this entire match.” Rune’s memorable run, which included an upset of Canada’s Denis Shapovalov, came to an end Wednesday in a quarterfinal loss to Norway’s Casper Ruud, 6-1, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3. Alma later took to her Instagram Stories to celebrate her brother’s accomplishments at the tournament. “Proud of you, always,” she shared Wednesday alongside an emoji heart. Alma, who frequently shares photos of her modeling shoots and travels on Instagram, had recapped her time in France, thus far, in a post on Sunday. In the carousel of images, Alma gave her followers a peek at her family’s accommodations and the sweet treats she enjoyed. Upon wrapping her time in France, Alma wrote Wednesday on her Instagram Story, “Over & out.”
