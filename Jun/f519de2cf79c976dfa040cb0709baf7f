Damian Lillard may be up to something. The Trail Blazers superstar took to Instagram Saturday, posting a picture of himself and Kevin Durant decked in a Portland jersey. The post sent shockwaves across social media, with some accusing Lillard of tampering. Others posted tentative trade options for the Nets forward. Even Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic jumped in on the mayhem via Twitter, captioning puzzle pieces to the photoshopped pic. The turmoil surrounding the Nets regarding Kyrie Irving’s contract situation has also brought a question of Durant’s future with the team. As for the Blazers, they are looking to build around their superstar Lillard – Portland traded away CJ McCollum, the team’s second option, in February. With Lillard turning 32 in July, the Blazers championship window is beginning to close, and a trade for another superstar such as Durant would be a boon for Portland. In the unlikely event Lillard and Durant become teammates, it still wouldn’t guarantee that the Blazers would be championship contenders. Any trade Portland would make for Durant would mean giving away assets. For Portland, that could include important position players such as Nurkic or Anfernee Simons. The duo would also set them back in cap space – the two stars both have max contracts, with Durant inking a four-year $198 million extension during last year’s off-season. In the meantime, the Blazers are still looking to build around the point guard. Portland picked Shaedon Sharpe at No. 7. in Thursday’s 2022 NBA Draft.
