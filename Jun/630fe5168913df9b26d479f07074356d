The father of the Rangers fan who was arrested for allegedly punching out a supporter of a rival team on a viral video has some words of wisdom for him — “It is what it is.” James Anastasio — whose son, James, is accused of sucker punching a Tampa Bay Lightning fan after Thursday’s playoff game— told The Post Friday he sees no need to “defend” the 29-year-old’s actions. “He made a choice. Sometimes choices in our lives have consequences,” said the elder Anastasio. “There’s nothing to defend. It is what it is. We’ll wait for him to come home, we’ll pick him up, and everything’s OK. Tomorrow’s a new day.” The Tampa Bay Lightning had just beaten the Rangers in game five of the Eastern Conference Finals at Madison Square Garden Thursday night, when Anastasio, 29, of Staten Island, allegedly sucker punched the unnamed man, police said. In a viral video, the Florida jersey-wearing victim is seen hitting the floor and appears immobile and unconscious as fans pour out of the building. Anastasio, who allegedly bolted from the scene, was later arrested for assault, harassment and disorderly conduct. He was scheduled to be arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday night.
