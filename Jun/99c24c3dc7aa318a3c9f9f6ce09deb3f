Today’s MLB schedule is already underway, but Kenny Ducey of The Action Network is here to give you his best bet for the remaining games (video above). In fact, Ducey’s best bet comes in the final game of the day — the Los Angeles Angels at the Los Angeles Dodgers. For his bet, Ducey is choosing to back the total and take the game under nine runs, odds courtesy of BetMGM. For Ducey, the calculus comes down to recent successes from both pitchers. “First off, Tyler Anderson – he’s been fantastic this year and I am not worried about a couple of bad starts,” Ducey says. So far this season, Anderson has posted a 23.4 percent strikeout rate and 3.07 ERA. The former stat should come in handy against an Angels offense that, over the last two weeks, have a strikeout rate approaching 30 percent. Further, the Angels rank 26th in the league in team wRC+ over that same two-week span. As a result, Ducey believes Anderson will dominate and surrender very few runs against a weak Angels offense. In terms of the other element of the handicap, though, Ducey doesn’t expect that the Dodgers offense will run wild against Angels starting pitcher Reid Detmers. So far this season, Detmers is throwing his fastball almost 50 percent of the time. And the Dodgers are just okay this season when it comes to hitting those pitches as they rank 16th in pitch value against fastballs. Further, over the last 14 days, the Dodgers are 22nd in the league in team wRC+. Combine those struggles with the aforementioned struggles of the Angels offense and Ducey expects this game will be more defensive in nature and stay under this total for the second straight game of the series.
