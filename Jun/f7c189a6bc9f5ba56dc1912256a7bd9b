A woman was left horrified after her boyfriend revealed he wore socks on the beach — and it has left people divided. Australian Arte Blythe shared the strange habit on her TikTok account. In the video, she wrote: “My American boyfriend committed an Australian crime today.” She then zoomed in on her boyfriend on the beach, who was wearing swimming shorts — as well as socks. More than 13,000 people have liked the video but it has left people divided. Lots of people were on Arte’s side, saying it was strange behaviour. One person said: “Immediate ban from the beach for 12 months.” Another said: “I think you need a BF refund, sorry but who wears socks to a BEACH EVER.” But some people were on her boyfriend’s side. Someone wrote: “I wear socks at the beach sometimes lol.” Another agreed: “This is totally fine!! Our feet get burnt and it protects them!” While normal socks may not be the option for holidaymakers, there are beach socks that are good to wear when walking on hot beaches or rocky shores, which have rubber soles. It’s not the first time people have been divided on holiday. One woman split opinion after she tried to get a family banned from their flight at the airport. And another woman kicked sand at an old man who sat too near her on holiday — but people could see both sides. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
