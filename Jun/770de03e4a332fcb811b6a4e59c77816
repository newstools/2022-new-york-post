Aaron Donald’s retirement will have to wait. The star pass rusher has agreed to a new contract with the Rams that will see him make $95 million over the next three seasons. NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport reports that Donald’s new deal makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated adds that Donald was originally slated to make $55 million over the next three years, meaning that the Rams gave him a $40 million raise for that time period. Donald has $65 million guaranteed over the next two seasons, which is about double the guaranteed money from his previous deal. Donald, widely considered the best defensive player in the NFL, publicly dabbled with retirement this offseason. During the Super Bowl pregame show, NBC’s Rodney Harrison spilled the beans that it could be Donald’s last game. There continued to be nuggets for the past few months that he was considering retirement, but clearly the Rams made it worth his while to run it back. Donald, 31, had 12.5 sacks last season. He is a three-time Defensive Player of the Year and has been an All-Pro for the past seven straight seasons.
