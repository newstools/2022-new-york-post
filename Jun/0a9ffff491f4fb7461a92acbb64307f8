A woman has revealed how she’s the proud mum of twelve children after giving birth every year from the ages of 16 to 19, and then welcoming triplets when she was 30. TikTok user Britni Church, who has found fame on the social media site under the name @ourlargefamily, recently opened up about how her family has continued to grow and grow over the years. In a short video clip posted for her 1.8 million followers, Britni lifted the lid on how old she was each time she gave birth. Opening up about the first four times she welcomed little ones, Britni explained she was just a teen. As a column flashed up that said “Teens”, Britni pointed to the ages 16, 17, 18 and 19, demonstrating how she was pregnant four times in a row for four consecutive years. She then explained how she also fell pregnant aged 21, 23, 26 and 28, before welcoming triplet sons when she was 30. Britni then welcomed her twelfth and final child when she was 32. Since posting the video, many have commented on Britni’s beautiful, big family and joked it was like she had her very own “basketball team.” However, the mom-of-twelve has also faced cruel comments from trolls commenting on how many kids she has and asking her if she had heard of birth control. But Britni has risen above the trolling and taunts and instead focused on the positive reactions. When one of her followers said: “Don’t know how you do it. Hats off to you. I only have 5 and I feel like I’m going crazy,” Britni quickly responded with a red love heart emoji. She also liked comments that said: “I salute you” and “you are AMAZING.” Another added: “Your house would definitely not be boring. How awesome, very happy for you.” Britni regularly shares videos that give an insight into her and her family’s busy life together.
