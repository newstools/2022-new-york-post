Let’s pray San Francisco voters send a message to progressive “prosecutors” across America on Tuesday and recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin. Homicides are up 36% from 2019 (the year Boudin was elected). Motor vehicle theft is up 36%, arson 40% and larceny up 20%. This, after he moved to end cash bail and greatly restrict all pretrial detention; his passion project is releasing as much as 40% of the city’s jail population. Open-air drug dealing is rampant. A surging fentanyl crisis took nearly 500 lives last year even as Boudin’s office filed not a single case for dealing fentanyl. He insists open-air drug use and drug sales are “technically victimless crimes,” you see. Homeless encampments line city streets, used syringes and human feces obstruct sidewalks and yet Boudin’s rule is: “We will not prosecute cases involving quality-of-life crimes. Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc.” Residents are fleeing in droves, for a population drop of 6.7% from April 2020 to July 2021. A fourth of those leaving cite crime as the chief reason. Boudin claims the recall effort is just a “small number of wealthy individuals.” In fact, it’s the same multiracial, economically diverse group of citizens who voted overwhelmingly to boot three woke San Francisco school board members out of office. His policies will never usher in the progressive utopia this radical son of 1960s terrorists imagines, but only wreck the city. San Franciscans are crazy if they don’t vote to recall Boudin.
