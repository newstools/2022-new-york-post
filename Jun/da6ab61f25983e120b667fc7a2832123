Game 3 of the 2022 NBA Finals could end up being a lot worse for the Warriors. In the final minutes of the Celtics’ 116-100 victory, multiple players dove on the floor for a loose ball. Celtics big man Al Horford landed on Stephen Curry, and the sharpshooter laid on the floor in pain for several minutes. Curry eventually got to his feet and stayed in the game briefly before exiting with the result no longer in doubt. “I saw him getting dove on,” Warriors forward Draymond Green told reporters afterwards. “So I picked up my foul pushing people off him because he’s screaming at the bottom of the pile.” Curry told reporters he “was in some pain” after the game and the injury was similar to the foot sprain he suffered in a March regular season game against the Celtics. That injury sidelined him for a month. “Obviously, in some pain, but I’ll be all right,” said Curry, who scored an electric 31 points in the defeat. “We’ll see how it responds. Not much other to say. I don’t feel like I’ll miss a game. Take advantage of these next 48 hours to get ready.” The Celtics own a 2-1 series lead and Golden State faces a crucial Game 4 in Boston on Friday night. ESPN.com reported Curry was walking gingerly in and out of the press conference, avoiding putting pressure on his foot. “[Horford is] a big body, obviously,” Curry said. “I haven’t seen the play, so I don’t know if it could have been avoided or not. I was in that situation with Marcus back in the Bay, and you just want to get your foot out of there. That’s all I was trying to do at that point, knowing the position I was in. Like I said, for what I feel like, it’s not as bad. So hopefully, it responds well over the next two days.”
