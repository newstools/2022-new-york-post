Amenities on steroids are not just for office buildings. The over 1,000-foot-tall Brooklyn Tower has leased its nearly 120,000 square feet of pools, gyms and co-working spaces to operator Life Time Group Holdings. The borough’s tallest tower will open in 2023 with three pools and lounge areas surrounding the iconic Guastavino-designed dome on the roof deck of the former Dime Savings Bank hall. The Dome Pool and Terrace will feature a 75-foot-long adult lap pool, a kids pool and whirlpool sundecks along with a hammock lounge, an outdoor dining area with barbecue grills, lounge seating, a fire pit and outdoor showers. A double-height poolside lounge and cocktail bar will have an area for private dining. Indoors, there will be five studios for barre, cycle, group fitness, Pilates and yoga, plus another expansive fitness floor for training classes utilizing top-of-the-line cardio and strength equipment. A calming space will be dedicated to chiropractic services and recovery. Additionally, a LifeCafe fast-casual restaurant will add to the resort-like social and event experiences. And for those that want a not-quite work-at-home environment, the building will have the first Life Time Work co-working space in the Big Apple. Private and open-plan workspaces and conference rooms are located in 15,000 square feet. The project was developed by JDS Development and designed by SHoP Architects in collaboration with Gachot Studios and Krista Ninivaggi of Woods Bagot. The Newmark team of Jackie Totolo, Peter Whitenack and Pierce Thompson represented ownership while Joe Mastromonaco of Atlantic Retail represented Life Time. Some other retail space is still available. Residences at the Brooklyn Tower range from studios starting at $875,000 to four-bedrooms for $8 million. Douglas Elliman is the exclusive marketing, sales and leasing agent for the tower.
