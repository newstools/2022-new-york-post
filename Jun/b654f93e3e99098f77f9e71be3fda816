State lawmakers were expected to approve legislation overnight that would limit the carrying of concealed weapons in New York after the Supreme Court struck down a century-old state law last week — but legislators were still waiting on a bill Thursday evening. Governor Kathy Hochul called the legislature back to Albany after the high court overturned the requirement that New Yorkers have “proper cause” to receive a permit for a concealed weapon beyond general fears about public safety. The decision appeared to leave the state some leeway to bar concealed weapons in “sensitive locations” while also allowing objective criteria for permit applicants, such as requiring that they be at least 21 years old and have no felony record. A legislative outline agreed by Albany Democrats and announced Wednesday includes imposing new training requirements on applicants while also barring concealed weapons from crowded venues like subways, schools, polling locations and zoos. The deal also included a provision making all private businesses gun-free unless their owners specify otherwise. “My team is reviewing all of our options, we’re gonna make sure we have the strongest protections possible,” Hochul said Wednesday. “I would break it into two major buckets post-Supreme Court opinion, and that is who is now allowed to carry a concealed weapon and where are they allowed to do it?” state Sen. Zellnor Myrie (D-Brooklyn), who is leading efforts in his chamber, told reporters Thursday as lawmakers pushed to finalize the legislative language. Meanwhile, Republican legislators lamented yet another instance of Albany Democrats being primed to approve legislation without giving them or the public time to review it. “We’re used to it being a little late but this is unacceptable,” Assemblyman John Salka (R-Cooperstown) told the Post. “It is just not a good way of doing government.”
