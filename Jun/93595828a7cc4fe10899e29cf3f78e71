That’s a rap! Rapper Wiz Khalifa, whose hits over the years have included “Black and Yellow” and “See You Again,” wants to part ways with his Los Angeles home to a tune of $4.49 million, its listing reps told The Post. Located in Encino, in the San Fernando Valley, the Grammy-nominated Khalifa purchased this 5,875-square-foot residence for $3.4 million in early 2019, according to the Los Angeles Times. This listing also comes a month after Khalifa — real name Cameron Thomaz — spent $7.62 million for a slightly larger home located a few miles away. Described in its listing as transitional modern architecture, the home’s design elements include smooth stucco, wood and walls of glass. A foyer with high ceilings marks the entry point of the home — and beyond it, there’s a formal living area next to a home theater, the latter of which has space for a couple rows of plush seats. The listing also notes a roomy formal dining room — accented with three oversize windows — opens to the main family room with built-ins, a fireplace, floor-to-ceiling glass doors that open to the outside and a 100-bottle wine bar. Meanwhile, the kitchen includes a breakfast nook and built-in Miele appliances. Upstairs, the primary suite includes a bar and a fridge, a custom fireplace, a spa-like bathroom and a balcony. In sum, the home has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and a powder room. What’s more: Head outside, and the new owner will have a pool and spa, a concrete barbecue and a small basketball court to shoot hoops. The current pool cabana can even be converted into a gym or a studio. Alan Taylor of Compass and Brian Capossela of Cap Equity have the listing.
