Like uncle like nephew. Arch Manning is following down Uncle Peyton’s path as one of the most coveted recruits in college football. Last week, Arch committed to play for the Texas Longhorns. Peyton understands his nephew’s shocking move from his own experience in the 90s. “The relationships you make in high school just don’t go away,” Peyton said Friday during his Manning Passing Academy. “That’s why I’m glad for his sake that he made this decision. I did have a conversation with him last week after he made his last visit, because he asked about when I made my decision. “I just remember when I got back from my last visit, I basically announced where I was going two days later because I knew. When you know, you know and there’s no point in dragging it out and creating some drama.” Peyton Manning famously committed to the University of Tennessee, where he won the 1997 SEC Championship and came second in Heisman voting. He then went on to have one of the most prolific passing careers in NFL history, winning one Super Bowl each with the Colts and the Broncos, and being elected to the Hall of Fame. With Texas entering the SEC in 2025, Arch will get a chance to test if he has that greatness against Tennessee and Ole Miss, which happens to be Uncle Eli’s alma mater.
