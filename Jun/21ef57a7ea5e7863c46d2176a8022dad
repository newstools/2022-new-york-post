Instead of a return to The Bronx as a visiting player, Clint Frazier has been sent packing again. The Cubs designated Frazier for assignment on Friday afternoon, hours ahead of what would have been his first game against the Yankees since they DFA’d him in November. Frazier had recently missed time with the Cubs due to an appendectomy, but was not a full-time player upon his return. The outfielder was batting .313 (5-for-16) with a .851 OPS in nine games since returning, though he started only five of them. In 19 games overall this season, after signing a one-year, $1.5 million deal with the Cubs, Frazier was batting .216 with a .653 OPS. Before his unceremonious DFA, Frazier had sounded happy to be gone from the Yankees, telling the Chicago Sun-Times “you had to be a cookie-cutter version to be on that team.” “Certainly don’t miss some of the things over there,” he said. “And I’m really enjoying the way that this clubhouse has maneuvered. It seems like there’s a lot of guys in here that are just accepting of everyone. And it’s been really good for me.” Frazier’s tumultuous Yankees tenure was plagued by concussions and the lingering effects of them, which he dealt with over parts of five seasons in The Bronx.
