A UK woman has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for treating a 15-year-old boy like a “sexual plaything” — plying him with hard drugs and even having his baby, a court was told. Sarah Campbell, 40, repeatedly had sex with the young teen over at least a year from January 2016, Merseyside Police said. Liverpool Crown Court heard how she had sex with him on a golf course — and even under a blanket while other people were asleep in the same room, according to the Liverpool Echo. The boy, who was not identified, told cops that he and Campbell would regularly “get off their” heads on marijuana and cocaine that she supplied, the court report noted. Campbell was previously charged with sexual offenses with another boy, which were eventually dropped, the Echo said. But she was charged with nine counts of sexual activity with a child for the 15-year-old victim the court was told had been treated like her “sexual plaything,” the paper said. Campbell stood motionless with her head down as she was sentenced Tuesday to nine-and-a-half years in prison. Detective Sergeant Peter Sloan praised the teen victim and his family for coming forward. “The atrocious abuse that Campbell carried out not only traumatizes victims when it happens, but has a huge impact on their mental wellbeing which can last a lifetime,” the officer said. He noted how Campbell had initially tried to skip court when she first went on trial, before being arrested again. “Thankfully, despite trying to evade justice by failing to appear in court, Campbell is now paying for her crimes,” the cop said.
