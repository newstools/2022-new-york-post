Two men pulled up to an NYPD stationhouse in the Bronx and pointed what appeared to be an assault rifle at three plainclothes detectives standing outside, police said. The incident happened at 11:54 p.m. Friday, outside the NYPD’s Transit District 12 at 460 Morris Park Ave. in the Van Nest section. The men, who were in a white and gray Ford Mustang, took off. Police caught up with the pair and recovered an imitation weapon, the NYPD said. Abdulrahman Alhanshali, 20, of the Bronx, was charged with menacing a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a controlled substance. The name of the other suspect was not released because he was underage, police said. Arraignment information was not immediately available.
