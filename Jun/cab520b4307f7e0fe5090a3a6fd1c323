The federal government is sending an additional 8,195 monkeypox vaccine doses to New York to replenish depleted stocks amid a spike in cases, especially among the LGBTQ community in the five boroughs. “I recognize the fear and anxiety this outbreak has caused, especially for LGBTQ+ New Yorkers, which is why my team and I will continue to work around the clock to secure as many vaccines as possible for our residents,” Governor Kathy Hochul said in a press release announcing the impending vaccine shipment. A total of 5,985 out of the 8,195 doses being sent to the state will go to New York City, though the exact timing of the shipment is up to the CDC, according to the state Department of Health Hochul said the feds agreed to send more during a Thursday phone call with White House advisors Dr. Ashish Jha and Dr. Raj Panjabi, with additional actions possible in the future to increase vaccine supplies once again. “As your Governor, I am committed to protecting our most vulnerable communities and ensuring equitable resource allocation and information,” Hochul said in the press release. Monkeypox typically spreads via direct contact with an infected person, especially during sexual activities or close contact in places like nightclubs. Symptoms of the viral disease include a rash or sores that typically appear sometime between seven to 14 days after exposure, according to the city Department of Health. Infected people might also have flu-like symptoms like fevers, headaches or fatigue. People who suspect they are infected should call 311, according to the department. A total of 78 people have tested positive for monkeypox, which can lead to serious illness in some cases, as of June 30, according to the department. The recent surge in cases has led to increased demand for the vaccine, resulting in shortages and the suspension of vaccine appointments in recent days.
