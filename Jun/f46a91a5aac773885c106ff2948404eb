Iman Shumpert said Sunday on Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” that he “felt for” Khloé Kardashian amid her tumultuous romance with his former Cavaliers teammate, Tristan Thompson. Shumpert, who played alongside Thompson in Cleveland from 2015-18, was asked on the late-night show if the power forward’s off-court drama, which included a 2018 cheating scandal, impacted the locker room. “It wasn’t a big disruption for us,” Shumpert, 31, began. “Honestly, when the outside world and stuff bubbles up, the best thing for us is that we’ve got games so we can focus on that. We get tunnel vision,” he said. “I think we just all felt for Khloé… it was sad.” Kardashian, 37, and Thompson, 31, began dating in 2016 and welcomed daughter True two years later. In the days leading up to True’s birth in April 2018, Thompson was seen in New York getting cozy with a woman. Thompson was accused of straying from Kardashian again in 2019, with then-family friend Jordyn Woods. Kardashian and Thompson ended their relationship for good when it was revealed the NBA star — who currently plays for the Chicago Bulls — had fathered a child with Maralee Nichols. Thompson issued a public apology to Kardashian in January. “Khloé, you don’t deserve this. You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you,” he wrote at the time. “You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years.” Kardashian has since moved on from Thompson, with Page Six reporting Tuesday that the Good American founder is dating a private equity investor whom she met through sister Kim Kardashian.
