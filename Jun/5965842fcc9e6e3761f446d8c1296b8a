A group of teenage boys was live-streaming their joyride in a stolen car moments before they the vehicle crashed, killing one of them and injuring three others, Texas police said. The boys, who are between the ages of 13 and 15, stole a 2018 Audi S5 Coupe from a home in Abilene in the early morning on Wednesday, according to the Abilene Police Department. At 3:40 a.m., police received a 911 call from a “concerned parent” who said their son and others were live-streaming on social media from inside of the stolen car and believed to be heading towards Dallas. By 3:50, the car owner reported the vehicle as stolen. Less than 20 minutes later, the Callahan County Sheriff’s Department received a call for a theft at a convenience store in Clyde at 3:57 a.m., which cops believe was committed by the teenagers. Police spotted the car at 4:07 a.m. in a parking lot of a hotel near Highway 351 and Interstate 20. The Audi collided with an unoccupied police cruiser at the scene, prompting an officer to flash his lights and try to stop the teens. The car sped away from the hotel parking lot, and police said they “did not actively” pursue the vehicle. Just moments later at 4:09,  the Audi, traveling at a high rate of speed, crashed into a telephone pole and caught on fire. A 13-year-old passenger was pronounced dead at a hospital from his injuries, cops said. The 13-year-old driver, a 14-year-old passenger and a 15-year-old passenger were also injured and taken to local hospitals for treatment. The 14-year-old suffered burns on his body and was taken to a hospital in Lubbock. The 15-year-old suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was treated in Hendrick. The driver was released from the hospital on Thursday and was immediately taken into police custody, cops said. He’s charged with murder, theft of property and evading arrest, police said. He is being held at the Taylor County Juvenile Detention Center.
