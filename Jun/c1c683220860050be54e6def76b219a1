The Los Angeles Angels are turning to Chad Kroeger in their time of need. For Wednesday’s game at home against the Boston Red Sox, the struggling Angels — who recently fired manager Joe Maddon amid a 12-game losing streak — opted to walk up to a collection of Nickelback songs, and yes, you read that correctly. ESPN baseball reporter Alden González shared the set list Wednesday on Twitter, revealing that pitcher Shohei Ohtani selected the 2005 single “Photograph,” while third baseman Matt Duffy chose 2003’s “Someday.” The Kroeger-fronted “Hero” from the 2002 “Spider-Man” soundtrack wasn’t part of the setlist, which, as González pointed out, is “what the Angels really need” amid the slump. Nickelback wasn’t enough to propel the Angels to a win as Los Angeles dropped its 14th straight game, 1-0. The Angels won their last game on May 24 against the Texas Rangers. In the wake of Maddon’s firing Tuesday, Phil Nevin, the former third-base coach of the Yankees, was named the team’s interim manager for the remainder of the season. The Angels will close out their series against the Red Sox on Thursday before hosting the Mets for three games, beginning Friday.
