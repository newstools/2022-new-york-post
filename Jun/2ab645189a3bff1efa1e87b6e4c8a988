A man was left stunned by a fellow passenger’s very rude behavior during a flight — and people on social media agree. Traveler Paul was flying with Emirates when he spotted the rude woman. He tweeted the image with the caption: “The person next to me on my flight.” The picture showed the woman, with a pair of boots on, resting her feet on the seat in front of her. Not only is it considered rude and dirty, but she was touching the headrest of the man in front as well. Despite her face being blurred out, people on social media slammed her actions. Someone wrote: “How come air crew are letting them do that ?” One woman even said: “I also wouldn’t have given her anonymity. She deserves as much respect as she’s shown others.” A third added: “If I was in front I would have sharply reclined my seat by now!” Many were also shocked that the man in front didn’t complain, to which Paul said he remained asleep for the whole flight. It’s sadly not the first time this has happened during a flight. Last month a passenger was left horrified after another flyer shoved their bare feet into their seat during a flight. The traveller was flying from Melbourne to Adelaide when the incident occurred. In 2019, a passenger was snapped with her bare feet sitting on a fellow traveller’s headrest while she slept. In 2020, a flyer sparked outrage after they used another traveler’s armrest to proper up their bare feet. But last year, a passenger was praised for his reaction to the person behind him putting their feet on his armrest. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
