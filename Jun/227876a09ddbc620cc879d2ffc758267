A hit-and-run scooter rider struck and injured a 2-year-old boy on the Lower East Side earlier this month, authorities said. The toddler was crossing with his father at the intersection of Suffolk and East Houston streets around 7:40 p.m. June 2 when the hoodie-wearing motorist on a green, red and black scooter slammed into him, police said late Thursday. The tot sustained scrapes all over his body and was evaluated by EMS at the scene, cops said. Police released a photo of the suspect and are still looking to track him down.
