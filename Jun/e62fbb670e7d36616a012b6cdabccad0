She’s a very sore winner. A bride was savagely struck in the head by her angry groom in Uzbekistan — after she beat him at a game during their nuptials, shocking video shows. The viral footage shows the newly married brute taking his loss out on his new wife in front of horrified guests as their best man and maid of honor stood beside them during the unspecified competition. “No one stopped him, no one [tried] to defend her,” an observer tweeted Sunday while calling for advocates against violence targeting women and girls to investigate in hopes of holding the groom accountable. The shocking moment took place during a competition between the unidentified bride and groom in the central Asian nation. A 30-second clip shows the woman beating her beloved at the game, prompting her to raise her hand to signal that she had won. The crowd then started to cheer briefly as an emcee praised the bride — before the groom raised his left hand and brutally struck her once in the head, the footage shows. Guests quickly fell silent, and the groom’s best man appeared to glance at his phone. The clip then showed the battered bride being helped off the stage by her maid of honor and another woman. Some Twitter uses advised the woman to leave her new husband before their marriage even gets going. “The start of a new family … Day One of marital bliss,” one tweet read. “I hope she has the sense to leave his sorry a– because it just gets worse from here.” Others were upset that the woman didn’t defend herself. “Too bad the girl didn’t hit back,” another tweet read.
