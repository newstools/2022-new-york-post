It may be Taco Tuesday, but a new TikTok trend could be the real reason tortillas are flying off grocery store shelves. Social media users are shown standing in a circle while holding water in their bulging cheeks and slapping each other with the circular flatbread, deeming whoever spits out the liquid first as the loser. Whoever keeps their composure the longest then wins the “Tortilla Challenge.” One example, posted by Patti Mac, has over 62.7 million views. Mac slyly stares at the man in front of her while whacking the man to her left with the soft shell. All three participants quickly lose. “Who else has watched this a 100 times???” one user commented “OMG I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time,” another added. Another video of a four-person attempt has garnered nearly 13 million views — and the slaps in the video are pretty intense. “Last one was personal,” one user commented. “PLS SHE WENT FULL OUT,” another said about the female participant. Demi Lovato and Jimmy Fallon even got in on the action in a video posted to the “Tonight Show” TikTok account. TikTok has added a warning on some of the “Tortilla Challenge” videos that reads: “Participating in this activity could result in you or others getting hurt.” But the latest challenge seems rather tame compared to other bizarre trends that came before it. Perhaps the most dangerous trend to hit TikTok is the “Milk Crate Challenge,” where wannabe gymnasts attempt to climb a pyramid of stacked milk crates.
