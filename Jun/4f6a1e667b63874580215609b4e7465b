Wild video shows a drunken British vacationer shoving his girlfriend to the floor and slugging a security worker at an airport in England after he was banned from a flight, according to reports. The viral, 19-second clip captures the moment the would-be EasyJet passenger violently pushed his gal pal down and punched an airline employee after the flier wasn’t allowed on a flight from Bristol Airport to Alicante, Spain, because he was intoxicated, reports said. The girlfriend is first seen lifting her arms while screaming at an airport employee. Her unidentified boyfriend then runs at the worker, knocking him to the ground, as onlookers gasped. Police told BristolLive that the 39-year-old man and 37-year-old woman were arrested for assault. A rep for the Somerset Police said the incident took place at 9:30 p.m. on June 17. Witness Steve Rich, 33, told the local outlet, “All of a sudden, the passenger just threw a fist over one of the guy’s shoulders and just caught the security guard on the mouth.” Rich of Wiltshire called the incident “unnecessary” and said it caused those who saw it to become upset. “The two girls who were working at the [gate] were in floods of tears because it’s scary for them,” he said. “Before the security arrived, you’ve got these two people saying, ‘How are you going to stop us getting through to get on this flight?’ … There were kids everywhere.” A representative for Bristol Airport told the news outlet, “Anti-social, violent or threatening behavior will not be accepted by Bristol Airport or airlines. “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and will fully support any police investigation.”
