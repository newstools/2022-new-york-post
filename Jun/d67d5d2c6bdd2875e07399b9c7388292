With his first NFL training camp looming in July, Kayvon Thibodeaux has no lingering injury concerns. “I’m fully healthy,” Thibodeaux told NFL Network. “I’m doing fine. I’m back training and I’ll be ready to go for training camp.” Thibodeaux, the fifth overall pick by the Giants in this year’s NFL Draft, suffered a vague — though apparently minor — lower-body injury earlier in the offseason. The ailment held him out of all team work, forcing him to wear a red non-contact jersey for a few weeks throughout June. Now, though, the edge rusher appears set to return for the most important stage of the offseason to date. Injuries are worth monitoring with Thibodeaux, who battled a sprained left ankle through much of his 2021 season at Oregon. He ultimately missed two games, though the prevailing pain appeared to hamper his production. The Giants have been especially coy with Thibodeaux’s status, amongst other injured players. On June 2, head coach Brian Daboll said that “hopefully” Thibodeaux would be “good to go” for training camp, though he wouldn’t make any promises. But now, with training camp still three weeks away, Thibodeaux certainly seems on track to be a normal participant.
