A giant swirling vortex of plasma has been captured shooting from the Sun. The mind-blowing footage shows a solar twister that’s the equivalent of a burning hot 12,000-mile tall tornado. The stunning video was captured by astronomer Apollo Lasky. According to SpaceWeather.com, Lasky captured the solar twister on June 21. The ejection was said to be part of a “solar storm system” and was large enough to “swallow Earth” if we were closer. Luckily, the eruption wasn’t facing Earth. In fact, most of the plasma ejection fell back to the solar surface. The rest of the solar material was hurled into space. Lasky was said to use a backyard solar telescope to capture the footage. He’s said to be based in Illinois and his Astrobin profile states: “I am famous for getting banned off of every astronomy forum because of my solar telescope. “Safety is my #1 priority and Nothing I do is Unsafe.” The footage has been revealed as space weather experts are keeping a close eye on an “enormous sunspot” that’s doubled in size recently. The unstable patch on the solar surface is directly facing Earth so if it bursts it could fling solar flares our way. A solar flare isn’t expected to hit yet but it could be possible if the sunspot continues to grow and behave in an unstable manner.
