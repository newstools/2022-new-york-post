Five Seconds of Summer stopped midway through their set during a Woodlands, Texas, concert on Sunday after drummer Ashton Irwin experienced “symptoms of a stroke” brought on by heat exhaustion. According to fans on TikTok, crew members carried the 27-year-old Australian musician off the stage after the band’s song “Lover of Mine.” At the time, the group said they were taking a break before a man returned and told fans that the show was over. “It felt like the stage AC had been turned off for a while & the venue was failing to provide water to fans,” TikTok user beth.365 wrote in a video of the event. “Upon experiencing physical symptoms, Ashton was taken to a local hospital for tests and medical review,” the band wrote on its Instagram Story on Monday. “As a result, it was advised Ashton had experienced extreme heat exhaustion. Thankfully and most importantly, he is feeling ok and recovering very well.” “I was in tears in the ambulance, because I feel I’ve let many people down,” Irwin opened up on his own Twitter account. “I’m looking after myself and getting rest now.” “I feel so loved and looked after by my brothers and team and all of you. this is the price a dehydrated drummer pays when he takes on Texas heat.” “I suffered from an intense migraine brought on by exhaustion and overheating onstage which made me lose my vision and gave me symptoms of stroke in the left side of my body. So the decision was to end the show there and then,” he concluded. “Following medical advice,” 5SOS has also canceled their concert in Rogers, Arkansas, on Wednesday. The rescheduled date is July 26, which will be the last stop on the North American leg of their “Take My Hand” tour. The band’s album “5SOS5” drops on Sept. 23.
