A team-building exercise in Switzerland went horribly wrong when 25 people suffered burns after walking over hot coals, according to police. The incident took place at a private event on the Au peninsula on Lake Zurich Tuesday evening, Zurich canton (state) police said in a statement. According to the police, participants at the event walked over a bed of coals that was several feet long and complained of pain afterward. At least 10 ambulances were summoned to the property to treat the injured. Cops said that 25 people were given medical treatment at the scene, and 13 of them were hospitalized with more severe injuries. Authorities secured evidence and opened an investigation into the circumstances of the incident. The German-language Swiss news outlet Blick reported that the corporate event was organized by the marketing company Goldbach. Some 150 people were present at the scene. The news outlet Kleinreport.ch cited an internal memo that was sent to Goldbach employees Wednesday. In the letter, CEO Michi Frank confirmed that several staffers sustained burns after taking part in a “voluntary”  team activity that entailed walking barefoot over glowing pieces of charcoal. Frank said the fire walk was preceded by “appropriate preparation.”  He wished the injured a speedy recovery and offered his support. A spokesperson for the company insisted that “no one was forced” to walk over the scorching embers. The incident bears striking similarities to a popular episode of “The Office” sitcom, in which the character of the boss, Michael Scott, encouraged employees to walk across hot coals.
