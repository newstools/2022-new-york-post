Half of Americans find it hard to stay healthy. A survey of 2,000 people found three in five US adults (58%) have attempted an average of five different diets in their lifetime — with 79% of dieters who fail immediately reverting back to their bad eating habits. The poll — commissioned by Medifast, the company behind wellness group OPTAVIA — revealed that 50% of those dieting reportedly do so to help them feel good physically, 48% to lose weight, 47% to boost their energy and immune systems, and 47% say they diet to feel good mentally, Talker reported. Over half of the respondents said they hadn’t considered other factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle, such as sleep (56%), mental health (57%) and hydration (57%). Many cited lack of time (41%) and lack of positive influences (41%) as the most common challenges they faced when trying to work on their health. Support seemed to be the biggest hurdle for many, with 67% agreeing they’d be more successful in reaching their health goals if they had more support and 66% agreeing having support from others also on a health journey is helpful when making lifestyle changes. The coronavirus has spurred many Americans to reconsider their health as a top priority, with 70% of adults commonly choosing their health over other responsibilities, like taking care of family (56%) and career (57%). Dan Chard, chairman and CEO of Medifast, said the results showed consumers are “seeking a solution that meets the demands of our modern lives.” “A holistic approach with a built-in support system can help those who have failed on traditional diets alone,” he said. “Building long-term healthy habits is easier when surrounded by a community of people who get it – because they’ve been on a similar journey.”
