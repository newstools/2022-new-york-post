There was lightning outside of Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night, but no sign of the Lightning inside. The Rangers brought the thunder against the Lightning in a 6-2 Game 1 victory to take a 1-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference Final. It was another impressive performance by the Blueshirts after a 6-2 win in Raleigh on Monday night in Game 7 of the conference semis. Goals were raining down at the Garden as Gerard Gallant’s squad hopes to carry it over into Game 2 on Friday night at home. To talk about the dominant win and the rest of the series, we bring you a new episode of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Ron Duguay and Mollie Walker, including a chat with The Post’s Larry Brooks.
