If the prices keep jumping, pay it like it’s hot. Rapper Snoop Dogg says he’s supplying his full-time personal blunt roller with more dough because of sky-high inflation. The “Drop It Like It’s Hot” artist and avid weed smoker replied to a tweet from the account UberFacts last week that said his employee rolls in between $40,000 and $50,000 yearly. “Inflation. Their salary went up!!” he wrote. He later reposted a tweet that said, “Employers: Take notes from @SnoogDog” in reference to the pay raise. During an appearance on Howard Stern’s radio show with actor Seth Rogen in 2019, Snoop, 50, revealed that he has a staffer whose only job is to roll him blunts when he wants to light up. “That’s his J-O-B, his occupation,” Snoop said. “On his resume it says ‘what do you do’ ‘I’m a blunt roller.’ P-B-R, professional blunt roller.” “If you’re great at something that I need, I’m hiring you,” the rapper added, noting he doesn’t have time to roll up his own weed. The employee doesn’t just roll the perfect blunt, he even knows when Snoop and his friends want to take another hit, the rapper said, calling his roller’s timing “impeccable.” “That motherf—er is like Lurch from ‘The Addams Family,’ ” said Snoop. “‘You rang?’” “He knows how to gauge the look on someone’s face when it seems like they want a blunt and if they do, he gives you one,” Rogen added. In addition to his paycheck, Snoop said the staffer gets to smoke all the weed he wants for free and gets other perks from touring with the musical artist. “Everything free I get, he gets,” Snoop Dogg said. “So when I go get some free clothes, they give him some.”
