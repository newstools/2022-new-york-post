Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he’s thankful for support from “African Americans” on Wednesday after tech mogul Elon Musk signaled his backing for the Republican firebrand. Asked about Musk’s suggestion that he would vote for him in a presidential election, DeSantis chuckled before delivering the line. “I’m focused on 2022,” he said in reference to an upcoming gubernatorial election in Florida. “But with Elon Musk what I would say is I welcome support from African Americans.” Musk grew up in South Africa before moving to the United States. The Tesla boss tweeted Wednesday that he voted for the country’s first Mexican-born congresswoman, Republican Maya Flores, in his new home base of Texas. A Twitter respondent asked whom he planned on backing for the Oval Office in 2024. “DeSantis,” Musk replied. A user pushed for his opinion on former New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang as an alternative. “I supported Yang last time, but DeSantis has a better chance of winning,” he said. Musk recently declared himself a Republican, arguing that he no longer had faith in the trajectory of the Democratic Party after years of consistent support. DeSantis has emerged as a prominent conservative lightning rod in recent years and is considered a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2024.
