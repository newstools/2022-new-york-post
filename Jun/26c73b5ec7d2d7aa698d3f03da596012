The 15-year-old boy shot dead at a chaotic Juneteenth concert in Washington, DC, was identified Monday — as police continued to investigate a motive for the shooting that also left three people injured. The teen gunned down in Sunday night’s chaos was identified by cops as Chase Lorenzo Poole. Police found a gun on Poole in the wake of the shooting, but it wasn’t the firearm used to fatally injure him, law-enforcement sources told the Washington Post. After Poole was shot, an eyewitness told WTTG that the teen could be heard “screaming out for his mom” as he lay dying in the street. Cops don’t yet know if Poole or someone with him was the intended target of the shooting. Poole had been shot twice before, including as recently as February, the sources said. The shooting broke out as police were trying to shut down the Moechella concert being held about 2 miles north of the White House. Hundreds of people had gathered in the street for the unpermitted event. “The person who took Chase’s life and brought this violence to our community must be held accountable,” Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said in a statement Monday. “The investigation is ongoing as detectives canvass the scene to collect evidence and conduct witness interviews.” Three others were injured in the shooting, including a police officer and two adults. They are all in a stable condition after being treated at the hospital, police said. Witness Daniel Dyson told WTTG that he heard Poole cry for his mother. “It’s hurtful to hear that, man. And no one was able to help him,” Dyson said. “To see him go, it bothers me. All of this that’s going on here it bothers me. And it needs to come to a stop. It really does.” Dyson added that he also saw the cop being shot right in front of him. “I was sitting next to a cop. Next thing you know, shots rang out,” he recalled. “He did not want to stay down. He proceeded on. He was shot in the leg. And he kept moving. He went to the fire. He did not run away.”
