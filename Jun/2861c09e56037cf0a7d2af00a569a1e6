Legendary comic book artist Tim Sale has died at age 66. “Tim Sale was an incredible artist, whose take on iconic characters had real human depth, and his groundbreaking page designs changed the way an entire generation thinks about comic book storytelling,” DC Comics tweeted on Thursday, confirming his passing. “Our condolences go to Tim’s family and friends. He will be deeply missed.” Sale — who worked on popular comics featuring Batman, The Hulk, Spider-Man and Superman — had apparently been admitted to a hospital earlier in the week with “severe health issues,” according to DC executive Jim Lee. His cause of death has not yet been revealed. “Tim Sale was a legendary artist who created comic book masterpieces across and beyond the industry,” Marvel Entertainment tweeted. “At Marvel, his Color series became stunning classics and remain just a glimpse at his acclaimed legacy. “We mourn his loss today, and our thoughts are with his family & loved ones.” The artist, whose career began in the 1980s, worked for Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Harris Comics, and Oni Press, often collaborating with writer Jeph Loeb. Their book “Batman: The Long Halloween,” is considered the work that catapulted Sale into popularity.
