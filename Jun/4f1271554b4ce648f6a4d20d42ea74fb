ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Isiah Kiner-Falefa sat for a second straight game with a tight left hamstring. The shortstop was not available as a pinch runner Sunday against the Blue Jays in Toronto and Aaron Boone said he made out Monday’s lineup — with Kiner-Falefa not in it — after Sunday’s game and wasn’t swayed to make a change even after seeing Kiner-Falefa run for trainers and field grounders during batting practice at Tropicana Field on Monday. “He’s pretty encouraged about how he feels,” Boone said before the Yankees beat the Rays, 4-2. “I don’t think it’s anything that’s going to be long term.” No medical tests were scheduled as of Monday afternoon and Boone said Kiner-Falefa was encouraged by how he felt. With Kiner-Falefa out, Marwin Gonzalez got another start at short. “Marwin can sit over there for a week wherever you put him, whether it’s the outfield or shortstop,” Boone said before the game. “It’s a luxury to have a guy who can play shortstop like that. You know he’s going to go out there and look the part. He’s certainly done that for us through this point in the season.”
