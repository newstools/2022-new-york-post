Tyler Sanders, a former child star who appeared on “9-1-1: Lone Star” and “The Rookie,” died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was just 18. Reps for the young actor confirmed his passing on Friday. “The cause of death is unknown and currently being investigated. We can’t comment further beyond this,” his talent agent Pedro Tapia told The Post. “Tyler was a talented actor with a bright future. He comes from a wonderful family and we ask that you respect their privacy at this time.” An autopsy is reportedly set to be performed in the next few days. Sanders entered show business at the age of 10. In addition to his role on “9-1-1: Lone Star” opposite Rob Lowe, he starred in projects such as “The Rookie,” “Fear the Walking Dead” and the Amazon Prime series “Just Add Magic: Mystery City.” The young performer, who also studied improv and stand-up comedy, received a 2021 Daytime Emmy nomination for his role as Leo in the “Just Add Magic” spin-off, and has a pair of independent films currently in postproduction, according to his IMDb.com profile. The Post reached out to Sanders’ reps for comment. Sanders was active on his social media pages, including his Instagram with more than 12,000 followers, on which he frequently shared photos of himself with his co-stars, friends and other nature-filled adventures. His last post was shared on June 12 from Vail, Colorado, where Sanders looked sharp in a blue suit and glasses. The post was captioned simply: “Styling.” Sanders’ cause of death is currently listed as “deferred,” Radar Online reported, meaning the medical examiner is “requesting more investigation into the death, including additional studies. Once the tests/studies come back, the doctor evaluates the case again and makes the cause of death determination.”
