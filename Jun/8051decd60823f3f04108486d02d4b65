Going, going, gone. A month after the Mets jettisoned Robinson Cano it appears the 39-year-old’s time with the Padres may be running out, too. San Diego is expected to request that the veteran second baseman be optioned to Triple-A El Paso on Thursday, according to The Post’s Jon Heyman. If Cano declines—as a player with more than five years of MLB service, he has that right—he would again become a free agent. This season has been a rough one for the eight-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glover. Cano, who played in just 12 games for the Mets this season before New York dumped him in early May as part of roster trimming, hit just .195 for New York with only three RBIs and 11 strikeouts. In San Diego, where the Padres had an opening in the infield because of a wrist injury to Fernando Tatis Jr. that still has him sidelined, things have only gone worse for Cano. In 11 games, he’s hitting a paltry .094 with 10 strikeouts and just one RBI. How much interest there would be in the nearly 40-year-old infielder who has also spent time at DH should he become a free agent again is uncertain. Before Cano, who spent nine years with the Yankees and a little more than two with the Mets over the course of his 17 years in MLB, signed with the Padres last month there were reports that other teams had shown some interest. But that was before Cano’s continued decline. With his strikeouts and ground ball rate up, his age and his having missed all of last year after being suspended following a failed drug test, Cano’s best days are clearly behind him. Now, the end of an electric but also at times tumultuous career could be near, too.
