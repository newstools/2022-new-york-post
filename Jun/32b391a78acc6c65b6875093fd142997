A vandal was caught on video scrawling hateful graffiti on the Catholic Charities building in Brooklyn this week. Video released by police shows the delinquent in the act as he used black marker to write the words “All Catholics are rapists” on the wall of the nonprofit organization’s downtown Brooklyn headquarters on Joralemon Street near Court Street around 5:20 a.m. Wednesday, authorities said. He then fled north on Court Street, police said. The NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident.
