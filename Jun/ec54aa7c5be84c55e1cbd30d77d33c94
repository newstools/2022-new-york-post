A 16-year-old boy was killed when he was flung from his SUV in a three-car crash in Brooklyn early Saturday morning, police said. The teen was driving a Honda Odyssey eastbound on the Belt Parkway when it clipped a Kia Soul and then hit a Hyundai sedan around 2:20 a.m., according to police. The Odyssey careened off the side of the road near Exit 5, the Bay Parkway exit. The 16-year old was transported to Lutheran Hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said. There were four other passengers inside of the van at the time of the crash who suffered minor injuries and were in stable condition, cops said. The driver of the Hyundai reportedly also sustained injuries but were not life-threatening. There were no injuries connected to the Kia Soul, police said.
