Newly released bodycam footage captured the dramatic moments two NYPD officers rescued a woman who fell on the subway tracks in Brooklyn on Monday morning. The officers were on transit patrol when they spotted the 25-year-old woman tumble off the platform at the Bay Ridge–95th Street station Monday around 8:30 a.m., after suffering from an apparent medical episode, police said. The footage, provided by the department on Tuesday, shows one of the cops jumped down to her aide and help hoist her up to his partner, who remained on the platform. The woman suffered a head injury and was taken to NYU Langone Hospital in stable condition, the NYPD said. The nearest R train was several minutes away from the station and was not a factor in the rescue, according to police.
