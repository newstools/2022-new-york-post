A second military aircraft in as many days crashed in the same area that a Marine MV-22B Osprey went down Wednesday. But it appears every service member aboard the Navy helicopter that went down Thursday survived, according to Navy officials. One crew member aboard needed to be transported to a local hospital. The crash occurred on a Navy training range near El Centro, California, less than 100 miles from Wednesday’s crash. “I can confirm that a US Navy helicopter crashed today on a US Navy training range near El Centro, Calif. According to our initial reports, all four of the aircrew on board survived the crash,” said Commander Zach Harrell, a spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Forces. “One of the aircrew has suffered a non-life threatening injury and has been transported to a local hospital.” The Naval Air Facility El Centro posted the statement on its Facebook page. Thursday’s crash comes after all five Marines aboard a MV-22B Osprey died Wednesday after that aircraft went down in a Southern California desert, military officials said. An investigation is underway. Another military aircraft crashed last Friday in California. Navy pilot Lt. Richard Bullock died during a training mission in Trona, California.
