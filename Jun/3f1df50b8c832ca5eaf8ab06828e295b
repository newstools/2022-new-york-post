A Brooklyn fire was intentionally set and is being investigated as a hate crime — after red swastikas were found spray-painted on a wall, officials said Wednesday. The FDNY was called to a smoke condition at 374 Myrtle Ave. around 1:20 a.m. on Tuesday, an FDNY spokesman said. The hateful symbols were discovered in a first-floor hallway after the flames were doused — along with a discarded can of red spray paint, an NYPD spokeswoman said. There were no injuries in the blaze, she said. The NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating. The building has a hair salon on the first floor and apartments upstairs.
