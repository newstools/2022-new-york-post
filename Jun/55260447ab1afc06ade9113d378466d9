Getting stood up by your date sucks no matter how you shake it. But getting stood up by your date while at their house may take the cake as the worst dating experience ever. And unfortunately for fashion influencer Hannah Robinson, that’s exactly what she claimed happened to her. In a video, Robinson wrote the message: “Can you be stood up at their house? “Like he went in there and it’s been 45 minutes of silence.” She appeared to be sitting on her date’s couch before the video zoomed in on the door her date presumably went through and never returned. Robinson also wrote in the video caption: “I’ll wait for 30 more minutes then I’ll leave lol I don’t know where he went.” In the comments section, several people offered their best guesses as to what Robinson’s date was mysteriously up to. One wrote: “He’s waiting for you to follow him lol.” Another added: “The boys called, he’s playing video games.” “He on the phone with his girlfriend,” a third comment read. Someone else joked: “Maybe he’s wearing leather pants and it’s hot.” It turned out the first commenter was correct and Robinson’s date was in fact waiting for her in his room. In a subsequent video, Robinson explained that she went into her date’s room about 10 minutes after posting the original video. There she found her date naked on his bed, seemingly hoping to roll around in the sheets before going out. When asked whether or not her date’s trick worked, Robinson replied: “Yes but no but yes kinda.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
