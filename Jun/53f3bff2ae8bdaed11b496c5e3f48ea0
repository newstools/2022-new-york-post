Cops busted a man who spewed anti-Asian remarks at a straphanger before slashing him during a fight on a Brooklyn train this week, authorities said. Nicholas Martin, 24, turned himself in at the 105th Precinct in Queens Thursday, and faces two counts of assault — one as a hate crime — in connection to the Tuesday afternoon attack, cops said. The 39-year-old victim was riding a southbound F train approaching the York Street station in Dumbo just before 3 p.m. when he got into a dispute with Martin, who at some point hurled an anti-Asian comment at him, authorities said. The dispute turned physical – with the suspect slashing the victim in the chest and the back of the neck, cops said. When the train stopped at York Street station, Martin ran off. The victim was treated for his injuries at The Brooklyn Hospital Center. The NYPD’s Hate Crimes Unit was investigating the incident.
