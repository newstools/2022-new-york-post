Some people love going to the store. You can try finding new deals, shopping for fun things for the house, or even picking up just enough groceries for a day or two. Sam’s Club does give you the chance to do that, or you bulk shop and get groceries and home goods for a full month in one trip. There are many ways to do Sam’s Club right, and now you can Get a Sam’s Club Plus Membership for 50% OFF! That’s only $50 for a membership that gets you in the door, extra deals on certain purchases, and a ton of other features online and abroad. Sam’s Club deals are legendary, and if you play your cards right, you can save hundreds on groceries. Find fresh produce, just-out-of-the-oven baked delights, meat, fish, and practically anything else your pantry needs. Even pet food is often up to 40% cheaper than at other stores!  After you’re done stocking the kitchen, you can fill your home in another way. Grab great deals on clothes, furniture, electronics, jewelry, and even full appliances. You could grab a new fridge and the food to fill it in the same shopping trip. But that’s all just a normal Sam’s Club membership. This is the Plus, and it does more. First, you actually get two Sam’s Club memberships: one for you and one for someone in your household. With yours, you can get free shipping online, curbside pickup (with free car loading), early shopping before the crowds hit, pharmacy deals, 20% off a complete pair of eyeglasses, and a Sam’s Club Mastercard. That’s already a lot, but that’s just what happens at the store. You also get special savings on hotels, rental cars, live events, attractions, and movies. Sometimes you can even get discounted tickets to Disneyland just with your Sam’s Club membership! Shop at one of the only stores that can hook you up with fresh fruit and plane tickets. For a limited time, get a Sam’s Club Plus Membership for 50% OFF for only $50 (Reg. $100). Prices subject to change.
