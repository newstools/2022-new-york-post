Worst. Belmont. Field. Ever? Maybe. But Stitches has been pressed for a pick all week after winning the Preakness. Considering everything we touch turns to gold lately … sit tight, take hold and take Barber Road. The Athletics have fallen on hard times, and so has starter Frankie Montas (2-6, 3.06). The Ks are still there — 78 at last count — but he hasn’t won in more than a month. He pitched well, allowing one run over six in a hard-luck loss to the Red Sox in his last outing. The A’s are in Cleveland. The Guardians’ Zach Plesac (2-4, 4.72) picked up his second win from 10 starts in Baltimore. Plesac, however, had given up 24 runs over his past 31 innings. Take the A’s for 10 units. Lourdes Gurriel Jr., George Springer and Bo Bichette homered in the second inning, Jose Berrios pitched eight innings and the Blue Jays tamed the Tigers 10-1. Up +1,064 easygoers.
