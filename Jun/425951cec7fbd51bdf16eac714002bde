Al Horford’s sister Anna was furious with Warriors forward Draymond Green on Sunday in Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Anna took to Twitter to complain about Green, who had a number of physical moments amidst the Warriors’ steamroll over the Celtics, 107-88, to even the NBA Finals at one game apiece. “If Draymond can’t outplay an opponent, he simply resorts to playing dirty,” Anna tweeted, adding a throwing-up emoji. “And (Jordan) Poole has followed his lead. Lmao,” she wrote in a separate tweet. Green received a technical in the first quarter after a collision with Grant Williams from behind. He later got tangled up with Jaylen Brown in the second quarter and appeared to pull down Brown’s shorts. Officials did not give Green a second tech. “I would hate to see someone ejected right now,” ESPN analyst Jeff Van Gundy said on the broadcast. “But the normal call would be a double-T.” Anna went back and forth with former Celtics big man, Kendrick Perkins, about Green’s play during Game 2. “How many times can Draymond hack Al & not get called for it?” she tweeted. “I love Al but he has to go up stronger than that,” Perkins replied. “I get what you’re saying but a hack is a hack,” Anna tweeted back. Horford finished the loss with two points to go with eight rebounds and a single assist. Green recorded nine points, seven assists, and five rebounds. Anna also re-shared a number of tweets criticizing Green and the officiating in the 2022 NBA Finals. She called Game 1 her “happy place,” when the Celtics beat the Warriors, 120-108, in San Francisco. “Ugly game, but we’re good. Can’t wait to bounce back game 3,” Anna tweeted with the hashtag, “#BelieveInBoston.” Game 3 is Wednesday night in Boston.
