Liz Neumark’s Great Performances has taken 10,000 more square feet at the Bronx’s Bruckner Building, raising the space leased by the high-end, nutritionally conscious caterer to more than 60,000 square feet. We first reported the organization’s move there from 304 Hudson St. in 2019, after the Manhattan location was taken over by Disney for its new headquarters. Great Performances serves such prestigious venues as the Plaza Hotel Grand Ballroom, Jazz at Lincoln Center and BAM. The Bruckner expansion will allow for an additional kitchen for packaged meal production, which the pandemic has made a significant part of its business.
