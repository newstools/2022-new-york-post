Brooks Koepka and Jena Sims’ wedding weekend was one for the books, but there’s one moment the new Mrs. cherished the most. Taking to her Instagram Stories on Sunday — one day after she and Koepka tied the knot in Turks and Caicos — Sims posted a photo of the couple sitting in the hotel gift shop, simply enjoying one another’s company. “There were many highlights but my favorite was spending ten mins alone (minus this one photo lol) with Brooks in the gift shop just to take it all in as husband and wife,” Sims captioned the post. “Highly recommend planned alone time with your spouse at your wedding!” Koepka, 32, and Sims, 33, kicked off their destination wedding festivities late last week, treating guests to evening events and sunset dinners. For the actual nuptials on Saturday, attendees were treated to a performance by rapper Ludacris at the afterparty. Sims, an actress and philanthropist, joked Sunday in an Instagram Story that she’s “been better” following the eventful weekend. Sims has been dating Koepka since 2017, with the golfer popping the question last spring. Prior to their wedding weekend, the longtime couple marked their fifth anniversary together. “Year   anniversary  Wood  Love you @bkoepka last time celebrating this date as a couple,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. Koepka, meanwhile, quipped in his own Instagram post that Sims was “wife hot,” as the pair enjoyed a date night at the NBA’s Eastern Conference Finals.
