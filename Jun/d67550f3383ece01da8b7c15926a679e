Anthony Davis hasn’t shot a basketball in over two months, according to, well, himself. While hanging out with Nuke Squad, a gaming YouTube channel, the Lakers superstar said in a viral clip he hasn’t taken a shot since “probably April 5.” The date is Davis’ final game of the 2022 season, when the Phoenix Suns beat the Lakers 121-110 – and eliminated them from playoff contention. Davis previously said that this type of absence from basketball is normal to him. His typical workout routine involves 10 weeks without basketball, followed by six weeks of basketball before attending training camp. Davis put up his career average this season of 23 points per game, but the NBA 75th Anniversary team member missed 42 games this season due to a myriad of injuries. And although he’s a typical fan favorite, 2022 was also the first season Davis didn’t make the All-Star game since his rookie year in 2013. Davis’ new coach Darvin Ham said he knows what the Lakers star is capable of — he saw that when Davis helped the Lakers capture their first title in a decade while inside the 2020 NBA bubble. “His skill set, size, versatility, defensive acumen, his relentlessness. His ability to give multiple efforts defensively is key,” Ham said. “But we need consistency out of [him].”
