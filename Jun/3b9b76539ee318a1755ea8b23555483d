A pair of thieves attacked a woman, ransacked her Queens business and stole her jewelry – worth thousands of dollars, authorities said. The 42-year-old victim was on the first floor of a building at 198th Street and 73rd Street in Fresh Meadows around 12:30 a.m. on June 4 when she heard a noise coming from the basement, police said. She went downstairs and found a man and woman, who she recognized as prior customers, police said. Cops could not confirm the name of the business and did not provide an exact address. The duo broke a mirror and a shelf, before punching and kicking the woman multiple times. They then grabbed her Cartier watch and bracelet, valued at $26,500, authorities said. Police released photos of the pair late Tuesday, showing them doling out money. Authorities are still looking to track them down.
