Former NBA center Andrew Bogut appears to be keeping up with Kendall Jenner’s love life. Bogut seemingly shaded “The Kardashians” star on Twitter last week following her recent breakup with Suns guard Devin Booker, when he appeared to reference Jenner’s dating history with basketball players after Thursday’s NBA Draft. “With the 2022 @NBA draft completion yesterday, one big name has yet to find a home,” Bogut tweeted, asking, “Which team will snap up @KendallJenner??” The retired basketball great, 37, went on to describe Jenner as a “solid talent” who is “versatile.” “?? marks around team culture + habit of endless self promotion. Doctors will need to do medical as body has been banged up,” Bogut added. In a separate tweet, Bogut also referred to Jenner as an “elite rebounder.” Bogut’s initial tweet received a mixed reaction from fans, with one person writing, “Did you really reach this far just to slander a woman? You’re supposed to be Australian and not a yank – don’t be like them.” The 2015 NBA champion then replied, “She won’t go out with you man. Sorry.” News of Jenner and Booker’s split emerged last week when multiple reports stated that the pair had gone their separate ways after two years of dating. Jenner, 26, and Booker, 25, are said to be focused on their respective careers, sources told Page Six on Friday. Prior to her relationship with Booker, Jenner had been linked to players such as Ben Simmons and Blake Griffin. As of Monday, Jenner nor Booker have addressed the breakup reports.
