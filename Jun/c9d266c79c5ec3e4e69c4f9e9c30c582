Paige Spiranac is in “disbelief” after being named the “Sexiest Woman Alive” for Maxim’s Hot 100 list. The golf influencer graces the cover of the 2022 Maxim Hot 100 issue, which features Spiranac in bed, braless under an open white button-up shirt. Spiranac posed braless in a number photos in the Maxim spread, including a variety of sultry looks. One shot shows the blonde in a pair of bikini bottoms while standing on a pedestal overlooking a beach. “So @MaximMag named me the sexiest woman alive this year and I’m in disbelief!” Spiranac tweeted Thursday, thanking the magazine “for this amazing honor.” Spiranac also gushed over the honor in a post on Instagram, admitting she asked, “Are you sure?” when the magazine reached out to her, “because I was truly in disbelief” about the offer. “To me being sexy is about confidence and feeling comfortable in your own skin. I’ve always tried to stay true to myself though out my unconventional path and now I’m so proud to be following so many amazing women who carried the title in years before me,” Spiranac wrote, thanking Gilles Bensimon, a New York-based photographer, for shooting the project. Spiranac was the guest of honor at a Maxim event in celebrating the cover, as seen in a video she shared to her Instagram story on Thursday. While reflecting on the experience with Maxim, Spiranac said in a separate Instagram story video that she got “double pink eye” the day after shooting the cover. “There has been a ton of stuff going on that’s really been sh–ty and it’s just so frustrating,” she said.
