A swarm of bees created a “hive-drant” in Midtown on Tuesday, cops said. Police got a call about the swarm amassing on a fire hydrant in front of 958 E. Third Ave. — between East 57th and East 58th streets — around 2:11 p.m. “Looks like a swarm of bees on a fire hydrant,” a police spokeswoman said. Cops were responding to the job.
