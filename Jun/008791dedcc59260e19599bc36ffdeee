A teenage girl and a man drowned in separate incidents while swimming in the Rockaways on Friday, officials said. The girl, 16, was swimming near Beach 108th Street when she went under and had to be rescued by civilians just after 6 p.m., police said. About 20 minutes later, the man, believed to be in his 20s, got into trouble while swimming off Beach 98th Street, cops said. The man was pulled from the water by FDNY responders with assistance from NYC Parks Parks Enforcement Patrol, the city Park’s Department said. The two were transported separately to St. John’s Episcopal hospital where they were pronounced dead, according to police. Both victims had been swimming in prohibited areas, Parks officials said. They were also in water after 6 p.m., when lifeguards leave for the day. “We are heartbroken by these unfortunate deaths,” the Parks Department said. “This is a painful reminder that New Yorkers should never enter the water in closed sections of our shoreline, where lifeguards are not present. We implore New Yorkers to only swim in open sections and when lifeguards are on duty.” Closed sections of Rockaway Beach are marked with signs and red flags.
