The Post experts handicap Saturday’s Belmont Stakes. Post time is approximately 6:44 pm EST. The Post’s lead horse racing handicapper 1. Mo Donegal: The Wood Memorial winner drew the rail at Churchill Downs and made the best of a bad situation. Found room and finished well for fifth to upstart Rich Strike who had a rail-skimming trip. Ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr. who has been around the Belmont oval a couple of times. Trained by Todd Pletcher who also saddles… 2. Nest: The filly took an impressive three-race win streak to the Kentucky Oaks and got outkicked by Secret Oath. Pletcher conditioned Rags To Riches, who beat the boys in 2007. Nest is a daughter of Curlin and may relish the marathon distance. 3. We The People: The one to catch will be tough to reel in as he may be isolated on the lead. If one of the other seven contenders dances with him he should hit the proverbial wall somewhere in the stretch…or he may win wire to wire. Action Network racing handicapper 1. Creative Minister: Coming into Belmont off an impressive third-place finish at the Preakness Stakes, Creative Minister is an improving horse that seems to have more room to grow. The 3-year-old son of Creative Cause should like the distance and possesses the tactical speed needed to outlast this ho-hum field at the Big Sandy. Creative Minister has two wins, a second and a third-place finish in his four career starts, so there’s every reason to believe he can contend on Saturday. 2. Mo Donegal: A trendy pick at the Kentucky Derby, Mo Donegal ran into a crowd at Churchill Downs and ended up finishing fifth, which was the first time he’s missed the board in his career. A late closer, Mo Donegal should be able to pass plenty of tired horses as this distance takes its toll on the field. Trainer Todd Pletcher has won the Belmont Stakes three times and Irad Ortiz Jr. is the top jockey in New York, so there are plenty of signals pointing to a big performance from Mo Donegal. 3. Nest (8-1): The only filly in the bunch, Nest’s running style should suit her in this race. Nest isn’t going to push the pace, but rather is comfortable stalking the field through the first half of the race and keeping within touching distance of the leader before making her move late. Nest has four wins, a second and a third in her six career starts and is coming off a game runner-up performance at the Kentucky Oaks. She’s a threat and a good price.  Action Network senior editor 1. Mo Donegal: I was impressed with his fifth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby after drawing the rail and getting off to a slow start. Mo Donegal loves New York, nipping Preakness winner Early Voting in the Wood Memorial, beating Zandon in the Remsen Stakes and breaking his maiden at Belmont. He’s rested and his hard-charging style is a perfect fit for this track. 2. Rich Strike: The Kentucky Derby win was such a shock that Rich Strike’s owner Rick Dawson never planned to race him in the Preakness. It’s easy to call the Derby win a fluke but Rich Strike was the best horse in the field. That’s saying a lot because the two he beat out — Epicenter and Zandon — are no slouches. Rich Strike will try to set the pace but will need to hold off the late chargers. 3. Barber Road: If you want a longer shot to put in exotics, give Barber Road a look. He finished third in the Rebel Stakes, second in the Arkansas Derby and a solid sixth in the Kentucky Derby. Barber Road seems to prefer longer distances and he gets a jockey upgrade with Joel Rosario. A lot of signs point to a strong performance from Barber Road on Saturday. U.S. Content Manager, Better Collective  1. Creative Minister: The third-place Preakness finisher has hit the board in all four of his races beginning with his March debut. Creative Minister has plenty of talent, and the sky’s the limit for Kenneth McPeek’s horse. Descending from the same line as Tapit on one side and the famed Storm Cat on the other, there’s plenty of reason to get behind the 3-year-old. 2. We the People: Rain in the forecast is a major plus for We The People, who I expect to set the pace. The morning line favorite has a Beyer figure of 103, the best in the entire field. A seventh-place finish in the Arkansas Derby is a concern, but enough talent here to finish in the money. 3. Mo Donegal: He ran into some traffic and finished fifth in the Derby, his first time missing the board in six races. Todd Pletcher knows what it takes to win the Belmont, having won three already. Before the Derby, Mo Donegal had a very impressive win in the Wood Memorial, where he beat out both Early Voting and Skippylongstocking. That came after a string of four races finishing in the money. Look for him to cash again in the Belmont.
