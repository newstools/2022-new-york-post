Joe Biden joked he may never return home after seeing the beautiful royal palace in Madrid. We’re here to help Mr. President — here’s how to escape the paparruchas (malarkey) and make that vacation permanent. Check out this Airbnb — a single room in downtown Madrid, completely doable in this inflationary world. And it comes with a hammock to collect your thoughts. Do you know the Spanish take off every afternoon to nap or relax for a while? You’ll fit right in! We know you love your ice cream. Try this Spanish speciality, which is almost like an almond butter fudge. And no pesky members of the press yelling at you. Follow in the footsteps of Christian pilgrims generations before by bicycling the Camino de Santiago trail. On second thought, considering your recent biking mishaps, maybe you should walk. And if you want to stay through, let’s say, 2024 . . . all the better!
