Three inmates who escaped a Missouri jail by cutting a hole through a ceiling have been captured, authorities said. Lance Justin Stephens, who being held on drug charges since early May, was one of three “armed and dangerous” inmates who fled the Barry County Jail on June 3. He was taken into custody late Tuesday near San Antonio, Texas, according to sheriff’s officials. Matthew Crawford, 29, who was charged with theft in late April, was rearrested Monday in Springfield, Missouri. A third inmate, Christopher Blevins, 37, who was booked on gun and drug charges, was captured on June 8 near Casper, Wyoming, nearly 1,000 miles away, according to the Barry County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies found Crawford hiding in a shed in Springfield, where he was unarmed and didn’t have any ties to the homeowner, KYTV reported. Blevins, who was nabbed in Mills, Wyoming, was spotted along with a passenger getting into a stolen truck, setting off a police pursuit that ended when he pulled off the road, according to the station. Investigators said the trio cut a hole in a ceiling and made their way into a water heater storage area before busting out of an exit door. They then stole a truck and later abandoned it near Salina, Kansas, where they went their separate ways, KYTV reported. US Marshals joined the manhunt for the escaped inmates several days after they fled, according to KOLR. The escape came one day after a Texas inmate who broke away from a prison transport bus three weeks earlier was killed in a shootout with police after he allegedly murdered a grandfather and his four grandsons.
