Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen are arguably the two best young quarterbacks in the NFL, and they have the potential for a Peyton Manning/Tom Brady-level rivalry over their careers. Paired up for The Match, though, Mahomes got the festivities going early with a total roast of his partner. On the set of Hot Seat Press Conference 2.0, hosted by J.J. Watt of the Arizona Cardinals, Mahomes was asked what he believes is Allen’s biggest fear. “Josh Allen’s biggest fear? A coin toss,” Mahomes deadpanned before letting out a grin. Allen’s head hung before providing a gentle response. “You know what? Pat’s biggest fear is letting me down on the course today,” he said. “That’s his biggest fear.” “That’s a golden retriever answer, I love it,” Watt replied. Mahomes was poking a fresh wound, as the Chiefs and the Bills battled in an epic playoff duel in January. In a back-and-forth, high-scoring affair, the game ended up going to overtime. The Chiefs won the coin toss, scored a touchdown and won the game without Allen ever getting the ball. The result of that game re-ignited the conversation about the NFL’s overtime rules, causing the league to amend them beginning next season. Allen said later in the show that he is going to use a golf ball with the infamous shirtless picture of Tom Brady from his scouting combine during The Match. Allen will look to get his revenge for the coin toss and the sharp comment when the Bills travel to Kansas City in Week 6 of the NFL season on Oct. 16.
