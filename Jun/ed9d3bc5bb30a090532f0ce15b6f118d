Actor Ewan McGregor shared the interesting gifts he receives from fans of “Obi-Wan Kenobi.” In the Disney+ series, McGregor, and co-star Hayden Christensen reprise their former “Star Wars” roles as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Now, some fans have sensed a romantic relationship between the characters due to their closeness — and some even illustrate the fantasy. “There’s a lot of homoerotic Obi-Wan/Hayden fan art that gets sent to me now and again,” he told GQ. “I don’t know how it finds me. It’s always a bit of an eyeopener.” “You open the envelope, you think you’re going to have to sign something, and you’re like, ‘F–king hell!'” McGregor admitted. The actors starred in the “Star Wars” prequel trilogy in the early 2000s. While the movies weren’t critically acclaimed at the time, the pair both said it was fans who grew up with the movies that made them reprise their characters. “So it’s a really nice feeling for me that that’s the case, that I have a sense now that there’s this warmth for those films,” McGregor said during a roundtable interview, Insider reported. “It absolutely is part of the reason I wanted to come back and play him again.” “I feel like I’m coming back now because of the fan base and because there is all of this incredible support now and love for the character,” Christensen added. New episodes of “Obi-Wan Kenobi” premiere every Wednesday on Disney+.
