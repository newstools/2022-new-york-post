Five major US cities are already on track to break their steep 2021 homicide figures — suggesting a particularly violent summer ahead. This year’s homicide numbers for Los Angeles, Washington DC, Baltimore, Milwaukee and Atlanta have all surpassed the rates reached at the same time in 2021, according to the data, first reported by Fox News. Milwaukee has been the city with the largest spike, recording 96 homicides as of June 17 — a 25% increase compared to its 77 figure recorded this time last year. In Washington DC, there have already been 93 homicides compared to the 82 in its first six months of 2021, or a 13% jump. Atlanta’s rate has increased more than 13% compared to last year, too, with 68 homicides across the city as of June 11 compared to 60 for the same period in 2021. Meanwhile, Baltimore has experienced a nearly 8% increase, or a jump from 142 incidents for the period last year to 153 so far in 2022. And Los Angeles has had a 7% spike, with 151 incidents in the same time frame last year and 162 homicides so far in 2022. The latest figures follow a spate of deadly violence across the country over the weekend, including multiple shooting slayings. Milwaukee was riddled with gun violence after 14 separate shootings left three dead and 15 injured, according to cops. The three shot dead were all men under age 25, FOX6 reported. At least 48 people were shot in Chicago — including an 11-year-old girl who took a bullet to her leg — from Friday through Sunday. Of the 48, four people were shot dead across the Windy City, WGN9 reported. In one incident, police said a 36-year-old woman was shot in the head while standing on a sidewalk Sunday night. The 11-year-old girl, who is being treated in hospital and is expected to survive, was also on the sidewalk when an unknown man approached her and started firing, police said. Meanwhile, cops in Baltimore are investigating a spate of weekend gun violence — including a quadruple shooting Friday night, the Baltimore Sun reported. In that incident, a 50-year-old woman and two men, ages 33 and 46, were injured when gunfire broke out in the West Baltimore neighborhood. A 21-year-old woman, who had been driving in the area, ended up taking herself to the hospital after being shot, cops said. A 15-year-old boy was also shot dead in Washington, DC, during a chaotic Juneteenth celebration Sunday night. The shooting, which erupted at a musical event that lacked a permit, also injured a police officer and two other adults.
