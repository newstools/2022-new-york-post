American preppy fashion is swinging back into style. In honor of the 50th anniversary of Ralph Lauren’s iconic Polo shirt — and a new book celebrating that evergreen garment — we’ve rounded up the summer wares certain to add some prep to your step. The mix includes a colorblocked, cropped top (complete with popped collar), a baseball hat from the buzziest collection of the summer and, yes, a strand of pearls (by a brand coveted by style icons Bella Hadid and Justin Bieber). Secure the vibe with a swipe of Hermès lipstick (the striped packaging is as pretty as the product), a picnic-inspired purse and a stainless-steel wine glass, all perfect for a night on the beach under a glittering array of fireworks. It’s a party in the USA.
