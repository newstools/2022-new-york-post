Talk about a star-studded double date. LeBron James and wife Savannah posed for a photo with his agent, Rich Paul, and singer Adele while at Kevin Love and Kate Bock’s wedding this past weekend in New York City. The Lakers star, 37, shared the photo Tuesday on Instagram with the caption, “ICONIC.” The foursome was dressed in lavish black looks to follow Love and Bock’s “Gatsby”-themed nuptials, in which the couple asked guests to wear black and white for the occasion. Adele, a 15-time Grammy Award-winning singer, wore an off-the-shoulder dress while James’ “queen,” Savannah, donned a sheer gown. James and Paul both looked dapper in designer suits with matching black bowties. Paul and Adele went public with their romance in the summer of 2021, when they were spotted at an NBA game between the Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns. James and Paul have been close friends with Love for years, stretching back to the pair of NBA stars’ playing days with the Cavaliers. James and Love were teammates in Cleveland from 2015-18. They won a title together in 2016 when the Cavaliers defeated the Warriors in a seven-game classic. Back in February, Love joked to The Post about James attending his wedding and gushed about what it meant to marry Bock.
