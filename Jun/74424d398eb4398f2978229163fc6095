The job of a sniper is to be hard to spot — and this stealthy assassin is doing a very good job hiding in the mountains. If you can find the deadly sniper hiding among the rocks and shrubs, you’re in the top 1 percent. TikTok user Nathan Daniels shared the rocky mountain scene, with the caption: “Can you spot the sniper?” The clip shows what appears to be a still image — but it’s actually a video and the deadly sharpshooter is taking cover somewhere in the scene. The footage left viewers stumped, with one user writing: “It’s so hard.” Another said: “I would have been shot.” But it all becomes clear when right at the end the sniper emerges from behind a rock on the right hand side. The mind-bending image has racked up thousands of views and hundreds of comments. Some viewers guessed incorrectly, with one thinking he was hiding behind the second rock formation on the left. But one user asked: “How are we supposed to spot the sniper when he’s hiding behind a rock?” And another said: “Hard to spot him when 95% of him is behind a rock.” Meanwhile, you’re also in the top 1 percent of people if you can find all the animals in this mind-bending optical illusion. When you first glance at the image you might not realize it contains contains multiple animals. Guesses ranged from five to eight animals in the pictures — how many can you spot? And when you first look at this optical illusion, you may not realize it contains multiple triangles. In fact, the image is made up of several triangles, way more than you might think at first glance, and only a fragment of the population can spot them all.
