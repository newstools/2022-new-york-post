It’s not uncommon for anyone to sing their heart out while home alone. However, one TikTok user’s love of singing has gotten them in trouble with their neighbors. Jesse Thomas has become a big fan of ‘Eye of the Tiger’ by Survivor – so much so, that it has made them a viral sensation. While they have plenty of fans on the social media app, it seems their neighbors are not as thrilled. In fact, the neighbors have become so frustrated with Jesse’s rendition of the song that they have made numerous complaints to her landlord. Now Jesse has received a letter telling them to stop singing the song or face eviction. In a TikTok video, Jesse wrote: “I just got a letter from my landlord that my neighbors are complaining about me singing Eye of the Tiger non-stop and if I don’t stop I’ll get evicted.” Of course, Jesse was still singing the song at the top of their lungs in the video. And Jesse said they weren’t going to stop, adding: “Sorry Pam, I’ll never stop.” It started with the TikTok trend of ‘filming yourself when you realize you can sing’ and Jesse continued to sing their heart out to the power-up anthem. Jesse went viral with the video racking up over eight million views and continued to sing for their fans daily. And viewers of the video couldn’t believe Jesse was being threatened to stop singing, one wrote: “Complaining about a free show?” Another exclaimed: “SING IT GIRL DONT LET THEM SILENCE YOU!” “keep singing babe! don’t let them get you down,” another encouraged. Other users were in total agreement with the neighbors though, one said: “Yeah I would complain if you did it non-stop and that loud.” “Poor neighbors,” one remarked. A third commented: “They’re complaining as they should.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
