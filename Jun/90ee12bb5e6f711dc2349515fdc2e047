President Biden was all smiles Wednesday night as he greeted Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko during a NATO leaders’ dinner in Madrid. Vitali, the former heavyweight champion of the world and current mayor of Kyiv, and Wladimir, a onetime Olympic gold medalist and fellow former heavyweight champion of the world, were in Spain to press for more Western assistance for Ukraine as it battles the ongoing Russian invasion. There was no immediate word about whether the president joked with the Klitschkos about his infamous wish to take Donald Trump “behind the gym” during the 2016 presidential election campaign. The dinner, held at Madrid’s world-famous Prado art museum, was preceded by a live performance by the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra, which has been in exile because of the war. Biden attended the dinner with his two granddaughters, Maisy and Finnegan, who filled in for first lady Jill Biden after she departed Madrid for Washington earlier Wednesday. The bill of fare included a starter of cod with orange and beetroot along with a lobster-based cold soup with a fragrance of Spanish olive oil and basil. The main course was  slow-roasted lamb with lemon puree followed by a desert of strawberries from the Spanish city of Cuenca dressed in anis, violet caramel and with a typical Madrid “barquillo” finger wafer biscuit. The day’s NATO meetings were highlighted by Biden announcing that the US will ramp up its long-term military presence in Eastern Europe to counter the threat of Russian expansion, including the establishment of a permanent command headquarters in Poland.
