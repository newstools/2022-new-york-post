The first-place Milwaukee Brewers and struggling Washington Nationals start their weekend series on Friday night. On the mound for Milwaukee is expected to be left-hander Aaron Ashby (1-4, 3.13 ERA), while Washington looks to Erick Fedde (3-4, 4.88 ERA). The Nationals entered Thursday night’s game against the Miami Marlins losing six of their last nine games. In those six losses, Washington was outscored 50-9. On Friday, the Nationals will face a pitcher in Ashby who has been much better than his 1-4 record this season. Ashby gave up four runs over six innings against the Padres in his last outing, but overall, he’s limited opposing teams to one run or fewer in four of six starts. Splitting his time as a starter and reliever, Ashby has given up zero runs in six of his appearances this season (16 ¹/₃ innings). Fedde gets the nod for Washington, and he’s been roughed up in his last two starts, allowing 15 hits and 10 runs over six innings. He faced Milwaukee back on March 20, giving up two runs in a 7-0 Brewers win. Current Milwaukee hitters have had success against Fedde, batting .300 in 48 plate appearances. Washington has hit lefties well of late, but Ashby is averaging just over five innings in his six starts. If he can hold down the Nats early, the Brewers will turn to their bullpen that ranks third in the National League in ERA (3.67) to finish off the Nationals. The play: Brewers -155.
