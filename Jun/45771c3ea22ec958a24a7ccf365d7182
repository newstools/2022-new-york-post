The Dodgers are starting to lose their grip on the NL West with the Padres hot on their trail in second place. While injuries have beset the Dodgers, it’s hard to feel sorry for a team that boasts the highest payroll in baseball at $262 million, per Spotrac. Over the past 30 days, the Dodgers are playing right around .500 ball, which means they’ve been consistently inconsistent. Nonetheless, they are repeatedly installed as heavy favorites. The Dodgers have been an underdog in only two games this season. On Thursday, the Dodgers host the Padres and Joe Musgrove, a Cy Young candidate. Musgrove is coming off his first loss as his record dropped to 8-1. He allowed six runs against the Phillies, thus raising his ERA by .53 points to 2.12. Given what we’ve seen with this budding rivalry, however, there’s no question this series figures to be another competitive matchup. Mitch White will make his sixth start for the Dodgers, who still have Walker Buehler, Dustin May, and Andrew Heaney sidelined with injuries. White is 1-1 with a 4.25 ERA, but the Dodgers are 0-3 in his last three starts. San Diego is 13-2 in Musgrove’s starts, and he bounced back nicely the last time following a no-decision and a Padres team loss. In that outing, Musgrove allowed just one hit in an eight-inning shutout against the Brewers. I’d look for a similar response from Musgrove on Thursday. Padres +105 (BetMGM)
