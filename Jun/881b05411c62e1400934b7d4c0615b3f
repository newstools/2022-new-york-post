Lil Nas X is peeved. The 23-year-old rapper released the artwork for his new single, “Late to Da Party,” on Thursday, which pictures the “Old Town Road” sensation peeing on a BET Award that’s already soaking in bodily fluid in a toilet. He also released a minute-long “Star Wars”-esque text crawl that addressed how BET “betrayed” the artist. The diss track comes as Nas X was completely snubbed by the 2022 BET Awards, which will air on Sunday. “thank you bet awards. an outstanding zero nominations again,” he wrote in a thread of now-deleted tweets, according to Billboard, after the nominations were announced. “black excellence!” he sarcastically added. “this not over no bet award this is about the bigger problem of homophobia in the black community, y’all can sit and pretend all u want but imma risk it all for us,” he again reportedly tweeted on June 7. Making sure the track makes headlines before the awards air, Nas X has been teasing the new tune, which features YoungBoy Never Broke Again, throughout the month. “F–k BET, f–k BET/ F–k BET, f–k BET,”  the song starts in a minute-long preview he posted to Twitter on June 7. The music and video for the new track will drop at midnight on Thursday. According to the “Star Wars”-inspired teaser, “NBA Youngboy is on house arrest, trapped on the isolated planet HATU. The Brutal Empire of Terror (BET) has betrayed Lil Nas X, turning their back on him after using him for clout.”
