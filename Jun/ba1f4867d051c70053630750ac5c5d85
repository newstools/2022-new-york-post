Get ready for Stern-Cooper ’24. Shock jock Howard Stern said Hollywood leading man Bradley Cooper has agreed to be his running mate if he runs for president in two years. According to the self-styled “king of all media,” the A-list actor texted him earlier this week congratulating him for potentially throwing his hat in the ring. The 68-year-old Stern said on his Monday show that being president is the one thing he hasn’t yet achieved in his career and that he would like the job in order to “make the country fair again” after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday. According to Stern, he received a warm text from Cooper in response to the show. Stern then took the opportunity to offer the “A Star Is Born” leading man the job of vice president. “Done,” Cooper reportedly texted back to Stern. Stern’s account of the conversation was reported by HuffPost. “This guy is gonna bring in the female vote like you wouldn’t believe,” the Sirius XM host told sidekick Robin Quivers on Wednesday. Stern also said Cooper, who has been nominated for an Academy Award nine times, had misgivings about joining a ticket that would be exclusively white and male. But the radio legend dismissed such doubts, telling Cooper that he would be “such an asset, people will understand.” Stern added: “He said yes, so my search is over.” This isn’t the first time Stern has openly mused about entering politics. He first dipped his toes into the political pool in 1994 when he ran for New York governor as a libertarian. However, he dropped out due to being required to reveal his personal finances. Last year, Stern said he would run for president just to derail former President Donald Trump’s bid for a second term. “I’ll beat his ass,” he affirmed in November.
