Two more of golf’s biggest names are set to defect from the PGA Tour to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series. Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed are next expected to join the rival circuit, according to a report in The Telegraph on Wednesday. Already two of the game’s most polarizing figures, the pair of major winners are following Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson to the controversial league. DeChambeau and Reed are not in the field for this week’s inaugural event in London, but, according to the report, have already signed multi-million dollar deals to join the league. There are seven more LIV events scheduled after this week, including five in the US. An announcement is expected before the end of this week’s 54-hole tournament, per the report. And DeChambeau, who won the 2020 US Open at Winged Foot, and Reed, the 2018 Masters champ, might not be the last big names to be unveiled. Rickie Fowler, who has said publicly that he was taking a wait-and-see approach to LIV Golf before deciding what to do, is also close to being signed, according to the report. The move by DeChambeau, meanwhile, is something of an about-face. Last week, after returning from a wrist injury, he said that he would be staying with the PGA Tour. “Every person out here has their own opinion on it,” DeChambeau said. “For me, I personally don’t think that at this point in time I’m in a place in my career where I can risk things like that. I’m loyal to my family that I’ve created around me with sponsors and everything. And as of right now, the golf world is probably going to change in some capacity.” Now it appears DeChambeau will be part of that change as well.
