A veteran NYPD officer was found dead in his Long Island home in an apparent suicide on Saturday evening, according to police sources. The 52-year-old off-duty cop was found dead in a residence in West Bay Shore by his wife with self-inflicted gunshot wounds, according to sources. Suffolk County Police confirmed its homicide squad was investigating “a non-criminal death,” reported on the street around 3:30 p.m. He was an 18-year veteran of the department, according to city records. He worked for NYPD Highway Patrol in Queens, sources said.
