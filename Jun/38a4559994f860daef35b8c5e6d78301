TAMPA — As Aroldis Chapman nears a return from Achilles tendinitis, the left-hander said he’s not worried about where he fits into the Yankees bullpen with Clay Holmes excelling in the closer’s role. “I am here, trying to recover, come back, be well, healthy, and help the team in any way, in any role,” Chapman said through an interpreter on Tuesday. “[Holmes] is doing an excellent job right now and I think he deserves the role that he has.” Chapman is expected to begin a minor league rehab assignment soon. He threw a 25-pitch live batting practice at the team’s Player Development complex as he rehabs from left Achilles tendinitis that’s kept him out since May 24. “I’m past that point in my career in which I would fight for a role, for the closer role,” Chapman said through an interpreter after he’d “already gone through that” when he first became a closer with the Reds in 2012. “When I got to the Major Leagues, they gave me the opportunity to close and I took advantage of the opportunity. Pretty much the same thing is happening to [Holmes]. If he has that role, it is because he is doing well.” Holmes allowed his first run since Opening Day in Monday’s win against the Rays and has been virtually unhittable since joining the Yankees last season, with a WHIP of 0.786 after arriving in a trade from Pittsburgh and 0.735 so far this year. Monday was Holmes’ first blown save, while Chapman struggled throughout the season, when he allowed runs in five straight appearances before hitting the IL.
