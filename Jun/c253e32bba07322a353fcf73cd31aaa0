Is there ever a dull moment when it comes to Russell Wilson and Ciara? The power couple has been jet-setting to various locales ahead of the quarterback’s first season with the Broncos, and Wilson, 33, was apparently rushing his wife ahead of a night out overseas this week. “When he rushing you… But you know tha shot worth it,” Ciara, 36, wrote in the caption of an Instagram video that showed her modeling a mini dress in a mirror. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star — whose animal-print dress featured sleeves and O-ring cutouts — added the hashtag “#GetTheShotByAllMeans,” and tagged Wilson in her post. Ciara stepped out in a pair of black, open-toe heels with ankle straps, and accessorized with silver diamond necklaces and circular sunglasses. The longtime pair has been in France, where they attended the F1 Grand Prix at Monaco as special guests of Mercedes to cheer on Lewis Hamilton. Ciara and Wilson recently relocated from Seattle to Denver after Seattle traded the to the Broncos in March. They celebrated with a romantic getaway to St. Barts, following the trade news.
