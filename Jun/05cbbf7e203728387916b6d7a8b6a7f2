It was cloudy with a chance of babies. Closed-circuit television footage captured the incredible moment a 1-year-old toddler plummeted from a balcony in Turkey but survived after bouncing off the back of a stunned pedestrian. “They rolled off my back and hit the ground,” human safety net Ruhi Asci told Newsflash of the amazing near miss, which occurred in the Haci Ilyas neighborhood in the northern Turkey city Amasya. The baby boy, named Khatira Amiri, had reportedly been playing on the balcony of the first-floor apartment when he slipped and fell through the railings. The accompanying clip starts off with Asci standing on a sidewalk in front of the apartment complex. All of a sudden, Amiri falls from above and strikes him below the shoulders, before toppling onto the pavement. Alarmed, the Samaritan whips around and swoops up the tot as bystanders gather around. The clip concludes with onlookers beckoning an unseen person up above — presumably the boy’s mother — to come down and collect her errant offspring. Asci painted the scene, describing, “At first, I thought a flower pot had fallen on me. When I turned around, I realized it was a child.” “A little blood came from their mouth and teeth,” the human trampoline observed, adding that ambulances subsequently arrived and rushed little Amiri to the hospital with his mother. Thankfully, the tough tyke appeared to be in stable condition, presumably because Asci’s body had broken his fall. It’s unclear if authorities have launched an investigation into the incident. In perhaps an even more incredible save last summer, a Russian grandma caught a baby that fell 15 feet from a window.
