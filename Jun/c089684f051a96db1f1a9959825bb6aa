Twitter trolls aren’t raining on Paige Spiranac’s parade. On Thursday, Maxim announced that Spiranac had been named the “Sexiest Woman Alive” and its Hot 100 cover star for 2022, which she called an “amazing honor.” Though many of Spiranac’s fans celebrated with her, one Twitter user took the commentary too far, posting, “@PaigeSpiranac has a horse head. Honestly. Dude has a long face.” Spiranac, who has put haters in their place in the past, cheekily replied with a photo from her Maxim shoot with a horse’s face Photoshopped over hers. “Seabiscuit Spiranac,” she quipped in reference to the championship racehorse, which elicited cheers from her social media followers. Earlier in the day Thursday, Spiranac revealed how she repeatedly asked Maxim about the honor because she was “truly in disbelief” over it. “I am so honored by being named the sexiest woman alive by @maximmag this year! When I got the I kept asking them, ‘are you sure?’ because I was truly in disbelief,” Spiranac posted on Instagram. The “Playing a Round” podcast host, 29, went on to thank the publication, as well as photographer Gilles Bensimon, who photographed her steamy shoot in Miami. “To me being sexy is about confidence and feeling comfortable in your own skin. I’ve always tried to stay true to myself though out my unconventional path and now I’m so proud to be following so many amazing women who carried the title in years before me. Thank you again Maxim for this moment and to @gilles_bensimon for these beautiful pictures!” she exclaimed.
