A 16-year-old Brooklyn girl said she doesn’t even know the creep who snuck behind her and stabbed her in the shoulder in a shocking caught-on-video random attack, she told The Post on Wednesday. Now Dagean Wilson says she feels “anxious” when she has to go out. Footage released by the NYPD shows Wilson walking into the Urban Juice Bar & Grill on Rutland Road in Brownsville around 6 p.m. May 22 when a man came up behind her, raised a black knife and stabbed her once in the left shoulder without saying a word. Then the suspect — who cops identified as Osie Lewis, 20, Wednesday afternoon — slowly walked off, the clip shows. “I felt a sharp pain,” Wilson said. “It didn’t feel like I got stabbed or anything, so I just went into the store, and two men came in and told me that I had been stabbed. They said they saw him do it. “They walked me home, and I told my mom what happened,” the teen said.  “I think it was just random. He didn’t know me.” Wilson now has to abide by new rules her mom set after the attack — she has to have one of her sisters with her when she leaves the apartment. “I just keep looking over my shoulder,” Wilson said. “I just keep looking to the side. It’s a bit scary to go outside now. I’m really anxious. It still plays in the back of my head.” She was taken to Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, where she was treated and released. Cops are still looking for Lewis, who is seen in the video casually stabbing the teen. He is shown in the footage wearing a black T-shirt with a picture of a white lion on the back, gray sweatpants and white sneakers. Police ask that anyone with information on Lewis’ whereabouts contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS, or crimesstoppers.nypdonline.org. For her part, Wilson said she is grateful for New York’s Finest. “I just want to say thank you,” she said. “It’s probably hard work to find this guy. I appreciate all they put into finding him and people like him.” Additional reporting by Tina Moore and Joe Marino
