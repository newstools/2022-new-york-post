The Rangers made their first move of the offseason on Thursday, signing wing Sammy Blais to a one-year, $1.525 million deal, an industry source confirmed to The Post. The deal preempted restricted free agency for Blais, who came over in the Pavel Buchnevich trade last offseason. Blais played 14 games with the Rangers this season before tearing his ACL. Though he was participating in practices by the time the team was eliminated from the playoffs, he didn’t return to the ice. Re-signing Blais is the start of what will be a busy offseason for general manager Chris Drury after his team’s run to the conference final. Kaapo Kakko, Julien Gauthier and Alexandar Georgiev are also about to become restricted free agents. Ryan Strome, Andrew Copp, Frank Vatrano, Kevin Rooney, Ryler Motte, Greg McKegg and Justin Braun all will be unrestricted free agents. The contract is a slight raise for Blais, who had been on a two-year deal with $1.5 million average annual value. Blais is expected to be at full health for next season, and could slot in on the third or fourth line depending on what decisions the Rangers make with the rest of their roster. The timing of the deal is at least good in one sense for Blais. He will turn 26 on Friday with his future secure for next season.
