Say goodbye to Clint Frazier. The former Yankees outfielder — currently playing for the Cubs’ Triple-A affiliate — is ditching his first name. From now on, Frazier will go by his middle name, Jackson. Frazier explained to Alex Cohen, a broadcaster for the Iowa Cubs, that his family and friends often refer to him as Jackson; his former teammates with the big-league Cubs did, too. Frazier certainly hopes that Jackson will have more success on the diamond than Clint. The Cubs designated Frazier for assignment on June 10 after the 27-year-old hit just .216 with a .653 OPS in 19 games. Frazier, the fifth overall pick in the 2013 MLB Draft, cleared waivers and accepted an assignment to Triple-A Iowa. And, so far, Jackson is faring well — he notched a two-run single in Wednesday’s game for the Iowa Cubs, his first contest since ditching his first name. He hit .239 across parts of five injury-riddled seasons with the Yankees.
