Logan Paul is back — and he has his sights set on The Miz. Paul officially signed a contract with the WWE during a visit to the WWE headquarters Thursday afternoon. “So look, I just signed my WWE contract,” Paul said in a video posted to the WWE website. “It is a big deal but after all, it is my contract so I’m gonna make a little addition here. Don’t look.” Paul proceeded to write “Coming 4 U @MIZ” on the back of his contract, holding the fresh writing up for the camera. “Yeah, you read that right,” Paul said, addressing The Miz. “Assuming you can read. I’m coming for you Miz.” Paul’s signing occurs with “SummerSlam” looming at the end of July. Initial rumors indicated that Paul would team up with The Miz in pursuit of a tag team title, but it seems like Paul has other ideas, perhaps looking for revenge after The Miz turned on him at WrestleMania 38 after their victory over the Mysterios. Paul made his WWE debut in April 2021 in a non-wrestling role and was a decorated wrestler in high school for Westlake High.
