Great Scott! A “Back to the Future” musical, based on the 1985 cult classic film that starred Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, is coming to Broadway. Producers confirmed the show’s transfer from the West End to Broadway to Deadline on Wednesday, with a debut sometime in 2023. “Synchronize Your Watches — The Future’s coming to Broadway in 2023!!!,” reads the tweet which includes a clip featuring the West End actors. The West End version of the show — which opened in 2021 — features music and lyrics from Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard as well as a book written by the original “Back to the Future” writer Bob Gale. While no official Broadway cast has been announced, the roles of Marty McFly and Doc Brown are played by Olly Dobson and Roger Bart. Producers of the show have yet to release a specific date on which the show will teleport onto a Broadway stage.
