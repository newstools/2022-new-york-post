There’s a new way to get addicted to Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts: in ice cream form. The North Carolina-based dessert chain has debuted glazed, soft-serve sweet treats — just in time for summer. A news release noted that the Original Glazed Soft Serve Ice Cream is now offered in 10 US markets and is available in shakes, cones and cups. The “one-of-a-kind ice cream” is made with ingredients from Krispy Kreme’s secret Original Glazed Doughnut recipe. The first 10 cities that will get to indulge their sweet tooth with the soft serve include Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston-Salem in North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; Norfolk and Newport News, Virginia; Charleston, West Virginia; Nashville and the Tri-Cities area in Tennessee; and San Antonio, Texas. In the future, the ices will grow to areas including Mobile and southwest, Alabama; Tampa, St. Petersburg and Pensacola, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Branson, Missouri; and Wichita, Kansas. “The introduction of Original Glazed Soft Serve Ice Cream is a big day for Krispy Kreme and our fans,” Dave Skena, the brand’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement. “We’re confident their love of ice cream and for Krispy Kreme is going to go to an entirely new level after they experience these deliciously unique shakes, cones and cups,” he continued. “We’re thrilled to begin our rollout on the first day of summer.” Their waffle cones are even made with Krispy Kreme’s doughnut mix and glaze flavor. Aside from the Original Glazed, soft serve will also come in Strawberry Iced Sprinkled and Chocolate Iced flavors. The “innovative rich and creamy lineup” features seven milkshakes — Original Glazed, Strawberry Iced Sprinkled, Chocolate Iced, Lemon Filled, Cookies & Kreme, Birthday Batter, and Coffee & Kreme.
