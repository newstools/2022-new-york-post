Freddie Freeman made his first trip back to Atlanta on Friday after signing a six-year, $162 million dollar contract with the Dodgers in March. Freeman, who was filled with emotion the entire night, didn’t hold back about how much he wished he was still playing for Atlanta. Though his message thrilled Braves fans, it seemed to hit a nerve with some of his Dodgers teammates. Hall of Fame-bound pitcher Clayton Kershaw was the first to make note of Freeman’s Atlanta favoritism after the night was over. “It was very cool (to see Freeman’s reception Friday night),” Kershaw told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “He’s obviously been a big contributor for our team. And I hope we’re not second fiddle. It’s a pretty special team over here, too. I think whenever he gets comfortable over here, he’ll really enjoy it. It was a good night for him (Friday).” Kershaw’s comments appear to be a gentle reminder to Freeman to remember which team he currently plays for. The Dodgers first baseman had a rocky offseason, starting when the Braves reportedly would only give Freeman a five-year contract offer when he insisted on six. The Braves then acquired first baseman Matt Olson in a trade with the Athletics and gave Olson an eight-year, $168 million contract. Freeman, who admitted during the offseason that the trade surprised him, had no place left on the team and headed for Los Angeles. After this season, Freeman still has five years to play with the Dodgers. If he wants to stay on good terms with his teammates, he’s going to have to cozy up and put Atlanta in the rearview mirror.
