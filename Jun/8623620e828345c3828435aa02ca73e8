Jeremy Giambi shot himself in the chest and left a suicide note, according to an autopsy report obtained by The Post. The former MLB player, who was a member of the Royals, Athletics, Phillies and Red Sox between 1998 and 2003, died by suicide this past February. The autopsy report, filed by the Los Angeles County Department Of Coroner, says the cause of death for Giambi was a gunshot wound to the heart. According to the report, Giambi was found dead by his mother, who had been taking care of her grandchildren, on Feb. 9. The report also stated that Giambi had a history of drug use (methamphetamine and Percocet), which began in the 1990s and culminated in a trip to rehab in 2014-15. He was not believed to have been using drugs recently, a witness told investigators. Giambi was hit in the head by a baseball last year while serving as a pitching coach, and suffered a broken zygomatic bone. The report said that since that incident Giambi “had not been the same since and was very negative, emotional and paranoid since the head injury.” The gun used in the incident was a Winchester Model 94AE Level action repeating rifle. Foul play was not suspected in Giambi’s death. — Additional reporting by Marjorie Hernandez If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.
