Mike Tyson has provided more explanation as to why he pummeled an irritating man on an airplane in April. Tyson appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Thursday and was asked about it. At first, he pled ignorance. “That’s not me. Does that look like me?” he joked. “I’m usually good at this stuff,” Tyson said of being able to restrain himself in the face of an agitator. “I guess it was his number.” Tyson then gave a mea culpa — and explained the extenuating circumstances behind the incident. “I was wrong,” he said. “That should’ve never happened. That’s me back in my primitive child stages. I shouldn’t have done it. I was just irritated and tired — and high and pissed off. Sh-t happens. I don’t want to hurt nobody.” The scrap occurred on April 20. Tyson, who was traveling to promote his booming marijuana business, was constantly badgered by a man named Melvin Townsend III and finally snapped. He did not face charges in connection with the incident. “They said they ain’t gonna pick up charges,” Tyson said in May. “He was f–king with me, man. I shouldn’t even be taking public planes. My wife gets mad I take public planes.”
