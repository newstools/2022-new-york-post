An incredible superyacht designed based on the deadly mako shark features a helipad and a floating lounge among other luxuries. The stunning 400-foot-long vessel is inspired by the “elegance and performance of the mako shark, and the silver, fluid shapes of waves,” according to its designers. The mako shark is known as the world’s fastest shark, so naturally, the Mako superyacht can reach speeds of 58 miles per hour. The design group State of Craft, which is based in London and Ottawa, Canada, has branded the vessel as an “explorer yacht”. Apart from the yacht’s impressive overall design, perhaps the feature that stands out the most is the helipad platform on the foredeck. It allows the aircraft “to safely land and be stored in the garage under deck by means of a platform lift.” The foredeck also features a swimming pool offering “dramatic views extending through the entire yacht.” Additionally, the edgy yacht features a unique “floating lounge.” The Studio at the heart of the vessel is described as “a light-filled, double-height space.” Another stunning feature of the yacht is the Pavilion- an area floating above the top deck that could be used as “a sky observatory, panoramic lounge, fitness studio or yoga space.” On the aft deck, you can find “a sunken, soft seating area” that offers 270-degree views. State of Craft’s principal and founder Daniel Goldberg said: “The efficiency and beauty of the sleek, sculptural shapes of Mako sharks served as an early inspiration for the concept. “I wanted the hull and superstructure, interior and exterior spaces to all be highly integrated into an overall volume with a continuous surface.” The Mako vessel has been described as “a comfortable home, entertainment space and adventure platform with a zero carbon footprint.” The zero carbon emissions are thanks to the yachts hydrogen fuel cells, electric engines, batteries and solar panels.
