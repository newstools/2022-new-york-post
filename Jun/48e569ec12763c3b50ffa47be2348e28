Most women know they are pregnant thanks to the endless symptoms such as sickness, weird food cravings, or not having a period. But one woman had no idea she was pregnant until she gave birth. Jess Davis, from the UK just thought she needed the bathroom. So you can imagine her surprise when she found herself giving birth on the toilet seat without suspecting she was pregnant. The mum took to TikTok to share her story where it has since gone viral raking up over five million views. In the short clip it shows Jess lying in the hospital bed and she wrote: “Thinking I need a big s**t.” She then reveals what’s on the other side of her camera lens and points to her new born baby writing: “Giving birth on the toilet.” Women who give birth without knowing they were pregnant are told they had a “cryptic pregnancy”. Jess confirmed in the comments of the video that she had a cryptic pregnancy and had her period all the way up to giving birth. But she revealed her child was a ‘lovely surprise’. People in the comments section were quick to offer their congratulations and share their fear it would happen to them. One wrote: “MY BIGGEST FEAR.” “You unlocked a new fear in me,” another person commented. A third penned: “No because this is my biggest fear.” “Congrats mama but I’m not claiming this energy,” a fourth person added. Meanwhile a fifth said: “oh my goodness, congratulations! was it a cryptic pregnancy?” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
