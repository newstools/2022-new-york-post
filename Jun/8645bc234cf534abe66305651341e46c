A six-year-old boy got to live out a baseball dream, but it didn’t go as expected. It may have been even better. During a break in between innings during Tuesday night’s Mets-Astros game at Minute Maid Park, the boy — whose first name was Oliver, according to the team — participated in a game where he was supposed to steal second base. As Oliver ran to steal the base, he found out he couldn’t lift it up. He looked up to Astros second baseman Jose Altuve and shortstop Mauricio Dubon for help, but neither of the infielders were able to lift the base out of the ground either. After a brief time of uncertainty, Altuve told the boy to run back to the Astros’ stadium workers in right field, who ended up giving Oliver the other base as he crossed the tape. In the final precious moment, Oliver — who saw the Astros roll to an 8-2 win over the Mets — was accepting high-fives from Houston fans while walking toward center field while holding the other base until the stadium workers pointed him back toward the exit.
