The Yankees have been on a hot-streak lately, but one fan lost dramatically. In a viral man-on-the-street video created by Jake Kosack, the content creator went up to a couple outside Yankee Stadium and asked on whom they would use their “hall pass,” or who they would cheat on their current partner with if given a free pass. Kosack asked the couple if they would grant each other a “hall pass” if it meant the Yankees winning the World Series. “Anyone in the world?” the girl asked Kosack. “My ex-boyfriend.” Her boyfriend, who was standing to her right, grinned awkwardly before saying he would choose her. The girl said the couple would fight about it to Kosack before leading him away. “Why the ex-boyfriend?” Kosack asked the girl. “He’s a good lover,” the girl responded. It’s unclear if the couple is still together.
