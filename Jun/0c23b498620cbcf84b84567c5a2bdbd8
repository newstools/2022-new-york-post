David McKay’s stint with the Yankees was short-lived. The Yankees traded the right-handed pitcher back to the Rays on Thursday for cash, the team announced. McKay, 27, was acquired by the Yankees on April 4. He was with the Rays, but had a clause in his contract that allowed him to be moved to another team if that team wanted to put him on its 40-man roster if the Rays did not. He made two big-league appearances for the Yankees last month, pitching two shutout innings. Over 26 games in 2019 and ’20 with the Mariners and Tigers, McKay had a 6.08 ERA. The Yankees also announced they added right-hander Albert Abreu to their active roster. They claimed Abreu off waivers from the Royals earlier this week after trading him to the Rangers in spring training for catcher Jose Trevino.
