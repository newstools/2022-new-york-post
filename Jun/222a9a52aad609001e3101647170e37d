Father’s Day is more than just a time to show your dad how much you love and appreciate him. It can also be a party! And what better way to celebrate the fun times you’ve had with your dad than a Father’s Day card filled with alcohol or a Piñata also filled with alcohol, a.k.a. Nipyata!® Drinkable Greeting Cards & Piñatas: $100 Credit for $70. Dads can bring so much fun to every day, so why not give that back on Father’s Day. A Nipyata!® has two options for fun. You can get a greeting card that has a funny message and a 50ml bottle of liquor. Or you can get the Piñata which is full of 12-15 50ml bottles of liquor. With this deal, you get $100 in credit. That means you can pick up five cards for $20 each or one Piñata worth $100. Each gift sends a different, fun message. The card is a chance to write something loving with a bottle of liquid courage for your dad to drink after he gets emotional. The cards have been praised as one of the most fun and often timely holiday gifts you can send (or send to yourself), and they’re just a great time. The Piñata is a piñata stuffed with booze, and your dad gets to hit it with a stick. That’s bound to make some memories before, during, and after it’s opened. And don’t worry, the bottles are designed to be pretty tough, so your dad can swing away. You get a varied selection of alcohol to fill the pinata with, but even if you know what’s in it, it’ll feel like a prize when it breaks into hundreds of pieces. And the Nipyata!® definitely puts up a fight. One reviewer from the Intoxicologist even wrote, “The Nipyata was definitely solid and put up a good fight to keep its goodies to itself. We finally broke it after a half dozen whacks.” It even comes with its own stick! Get your dad a drink and a Father’s Day to remember. During our Father’s Day Sale, you can get the Nipyata!® Drinkable Greeting Cards & Piñatas: $100 Credit for $70, but hurry, as this sale ends June 19th! Prices subject to change.
