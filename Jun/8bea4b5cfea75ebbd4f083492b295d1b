A man was fatally shot in the head in a broad-daylight attack in the Bronx, police said. The 29-year-old victim was standing on Walton Avenue near East 183rd Street in Fordham Heights around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday when three men got out of a black Volkswagen and approached him, police said. Someone in the group opened fire, striking the man in the head, authorities said. No arrests have been made, and the motive for the slaying was unclear Thursday morning. The victim’s name has not been released, pending family notification.
