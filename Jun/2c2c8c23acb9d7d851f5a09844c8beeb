A dance-floor brawl broke out on board a Carnival cruise ship early Tuesday ahead of its docking in the Big Apple, authorities said. The free-for-all erupted inside a nightclub within the Carnival Magic ship around 5:20 a.m. as it sailed near the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, the NYPD said. The fracas began as a skirmish between two people, WPIX reported. Dozens more joined the fray — with an estimated 40 to 60 people involved, according to WNBC. Security on board attempted to break up the fight, but then called for assistance from the Coast Guard, cops said. The Coast Guard then escorted the ship into Pier 88 near West 48th Street in Manhattan, police said. NYPD cops were on hand as passengers disembarked the cruise. The ship, which departed from the Cape Liberty Cruise Port in New Jersey on June 20, traveled to Dominicana, Turks and Caicos and a private island in the Bahamas before returning to the East Coast, according to an online tracker. No information was immediately available on arrests. Officials could not confirm by the afternoon whether the fight would be handled by the NYPD, New Jersey authorities, or if it happened in international waters. “Last night while Carnival Magic was returning to New York, a number of guests were involved in an altercation in a nightclub,” the cruise liner said in a statement. “Thankfully no serious injuries were reported and our onboard security team intervened.” “The ship arrived as scheduled this morning and shoreside law enforcement authorities were notified and met the ship to interview suspects and witnesses and conduct an investigation.”
