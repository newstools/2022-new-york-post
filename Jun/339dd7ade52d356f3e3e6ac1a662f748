Cameron Young has never made a cut in three appearances at the U.S. Open. At least the Westchester native did something on Friday that he’ll never forget. The 25-year-old aced the par-3 sixth hole at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. Sitting at 7-over-par and headed for the weekend off, Young stuck an 8-iron to within a few feet of the flag on the 165-yard hole, then watched as his ball disappeared. The third-year pro threw his hands in the air, tossed his club behind him and exchanged high-fives with playing partners Will Zalatoris and Joaquin Niemann as well as the caddies in the group. The ace, which was sandwiched between three birdies, gave the PGA Tour rookie a chance of making the cut. But in the end he ended up missing it by a shot. Still, it’s already been a memorable year for Young. Last month, he nearly won the PGA championship. He’s also climbed to No. 31 in the world and sits 16th on the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup points list. The U.S. Open continues through Sunday.
