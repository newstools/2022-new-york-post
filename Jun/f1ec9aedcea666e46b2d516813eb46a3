Jets rookie Garrett Wilson is learning the ins and outs of the NFL as he prepares for his first professional season. The 10th overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft recently learned one of the league’s most notorious traditions – the “rookie dinner.” The practice consists of a rookie player taking their position group out for an extravagant meal, which the rookie is then obligated to pay for in its entirety. While appearing on “The Pivot” podcast with NFL veterans Ryan Clark, Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder, Wilson revealed he was excited to take his Jets teammates out to dinner and bond with the wide receiver room – that is, until he found out how much it would cost him. “I’ve got to take all the receivers to a dinner,” Wilson said. “That’s going to be cool, I’m excited for that.” “It’s not going to be cool,” Clark quipped. The Super Bowl-winning safety went on to explain the exorbitant price of these meals, suggesting $75,000 as a possible price tag. Wilson’s excitement for the dinner quickly dissipated. His hilariously shocked facial expression says it all. “They ain’t doing me for 75K,” a taken aback Wilson countered. “He thinks it’s his decision,” Crowder jokingly declared, sending the entire room into boisterous laughter. It seems the Ohio State product will soon be putting his $20.55 million contract and $12.1 million signing bonus to good use.
