A 14-year-old boy was stabbed Monday outside a Staten Island middle school during a brawl that erupted as school let out, authorities say. The young teen was stabbed in the torso just before 3 p.m. outside IS 49 Berta A. Dreyfus and ran back inside for help, according to police and sources. EMS took the boy to Richmond University Medical Center, where he was expected to recover. Cops were still investigating the incident Monday afternoon. The New York City Department of Education said it plans to add safety measures, including extra school safety agents and counselors to the school. “Violence has absolutely no place in our schools, and this senseless act against one of our students is reprehensible,” said Jenna Lyle, a spokesperson for the DOE. “This incident occurred outside the school building during dismissal, and NYPD school safety agents immediately moved to intervene, ensuring all other students and staff are safe,” Lyle added.
