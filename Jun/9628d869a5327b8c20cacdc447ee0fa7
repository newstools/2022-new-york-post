New pictures have emerged of disgraced first son Hunter Biden — this time, thankfully, fully clothed. The 52-year-old son of President Biden was snapped taking one of his own daughters, Maisy, to lunch in California, just a day after The Post revealed his latest embarrassing personal video leak, showing him naked and playing with a pellet gun while cavorting with a hooker. Biden was fully covered for his lunch outing in Malibu, wearing pants, boots, a buttoned-up casual jacket and even a light brown baseball cap, while also proudly wearing an “I voted” sticker. (The Golden State held its primary elections for federal and statewide offices Tuesday.) Hunter smiled as he entered the laidback Cholada Thai Beach Cuisine with Maisy, 21, who wore a yellow T-shirt and loose slacks, with a blue facemask around her chin. Biden has long brought his father into disgrace, with Tuesday’s leak just the latest humiliation in his long-running battle with drug addition. Maisy is one of three kids Hunter shares with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, who has added to Hunter’s humiliation by detailing in her forthcoming memoir how his addiction and philandering destroyed their marriage of 24 years.
