Chris Kreider wasted no time in the Eastern Conference Final. The Rangers veteran opened the scoring just 1:11 in Game 1 of the series against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Frank Vatrano chipped the puck ahead from center for Mika Zibanejad, who faked a snapshot before finding Kreider wide open and streaking down the middle of the ice all alone. The 31-year-old deposited a wrist shot behind goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy for an expedient lead. It was the first shot of the game for the Blueshirts. The tally marked Kreider’s third in the last four periods of Rangers hockey, following a pair of goals in the Game 7 win over the Hurricanes to close out the second round. He now has nine goals and 12 points on the postseason. The lead would not last long, however. The Bolts answered back at 7:19 of the period on a blast by Steven Stamkos from the top of the circle.
