MJ Daffue brought some hospitality to the US Open. The 33-year-old, who finished atop the leaderboard after Day 1 at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. before struggling on the back nine in Day 2, put his tee shot onto the hospitality deck at the 14th hole during Friday’s second round. Instead of taking a drop, he lined up for a shot – which perplexed the broadcast crew. “I hope he loves Genesis, ‘Carpet Crawlers,'” NBC analyst Nick Faldo said, referencing the 1999 hit song. “What is he thinking? Fingers crossed, everybody.” Daffue had a warning for the onlookers. “I’m coming right over you, sir,” he told one fan, to the delight of the crowd around him. His shot was even more crowd-pleasing: Daffue sent it from the carpet into the rough just off the green. A bad chip forced him to settle for a bogey on the par-5 hole, but his incredible shot earned him some high praise. “That’s a ‘Tin Cup’ there,” Faldo said, this time pointing to the 1996 movie in which a golfer completes a round using garden tools.
