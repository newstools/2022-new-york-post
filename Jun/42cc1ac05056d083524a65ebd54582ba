Ever since Kayvon Thibodeaux got twisted around during a practice two weeks ago inside the field house, the rookie edge rusher has been wearing a red jersey and not doing much during the organized team activity sessions. He was wearing a red jersey again on Thursday for OTA No. 9 and it is not known when he will be cleared for full participation. “I think they’re all at different spots, the guys in red jerseys,” head coach Brian Daboll said. “Knock on wood hopefully he’ll be good to go.” Asked if “ready to go” meant for the start of training camp, Daboll said, “Yeah, hopefully. But I’m not gonna promise anything. He may or may not.” Considering that the start of training camp is not until seven weeks from now at the end of July, not being able to promise that Thibodeaux will be ready is an injury situation worth monitoring. Thibodeaux, the No. 5 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, was slowed much of the 2021 season with Oregon with a sprained left ankle. He missed two games and battled to find his form after returning from the injury. The Giants have a mandatory three-day minicamp next week. Daboll did not promise Thibodeaux will be ready for that. “I’m not expecting him to be out of a red jersey today,” Daboll said. “We’ll just start with today. We’ll see next week how it goes. There’s a lot of things that can happen over the weekend.” Another prominent young player, left tackle Andrew Thomas, is coming off left ankle surgery following the 2021 season. Thomas is also wearing a red jersey. Daboll said “hope so” when asked if Thomas might be ready for next week’s minicamp. “He’s doing a good job,” Daboll said of Thomas. “Everything we’ve asked him to do, rehab-wise.”
