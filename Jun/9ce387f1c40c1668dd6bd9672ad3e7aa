Coachella will once again return to the desert in 2023. The Instagrammable musical festival will take place during its usual weekends, April 15 to 17 and 21 to 23, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Frank Ocean was announced as one of next year’s headliners Tuesday. The “Lost” singer was supposed to perform at 2020’s event, which was ultimately scrapped that year and in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Travis Scott pulled out of his 2021 headliner spot after 10 people were killed in a “mass casualty incident” at his own Astroworld performance on Nov. 5 in Houston, Texas. Kayne West also bailed on his 2022 headliner opportunity, causing the festival to recruit The Weeknd x Swedish House Mafia. Billie Eilish and Harry Styles served as fellow headliners this year. Daily cases of COVID-19 in Riverside County spiked more than 75 percent two weeks after tens of thousands of music fans flooded the area for 2022, according to NBC News. Tickets for next year’s event will go on sale Friday, June 17, at 1 p.m. ET.
