Czech supermodel Karolina Kurkova just sold her Tribeca loft for $4.5 million, The Post has learned. Located at 92 Laight St., in the River Lofts condo building, the two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom unit spans over 2,000 square feet. This home features direct Hudson River views from the west-facing living room, and wide open-city views from east-facing bedrooms. Kurkova, who has graced the covers of Vogue — and has worked with brands including Louis Vuitton, Valentino, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Victoria’s Secret — had lived in the home since 2005, and purchased it for $2.31 million. The move to sell her place after 17 years comes as her family outgrew the space, Kurkova, 38, told The Post. “My Laight street apartment is so special. It has everything you could want in a downtown New York home — incredible views, close proximity to the water and park, a true neighborhood feel but the best part for me was the feeling of happiness and ease when I would come home from work each day,” Kurkova said. “It is a modern-day oasis in the bustling city,” she said. “I have had some of the best memories there.” Kurkova had designed the space with architect and former model Robin Osler. The living/dining room features a hidden television. The white kitchen comes with a  breakfast bar seating and top-line appliances. Features also include an art gallery and a home office. The primary suite comes with a balcony and an ensuite bathroom with a dual vanity, and a deep soaking tub with a glass-enclosed stall shower. Ruthie & Ethan Assouline, with The Assouline Team at Compass, represented Kurkova in the transaction — and Amy Rivers from ELIKA Real Estate repped the undisclosed buyer. The full-service building offers a 24-hour doorman, a fitness center, bicycle storage, a garden and a parking garage.
