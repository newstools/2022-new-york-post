Congratulations to Rep. Lee Zeldin for his victory in Tuesday night’s primary. Now comes the real battle: Unseating Gov. Kathy Hochul, who cruised to victory on her side of the political ledger. New Yorkers unfortunately have seen what one-party rule has wrought. A Democratic-controlled Albany and a left-wing mayor managed to set back New York City decades when it comes to quality of life, increasing crime, homelessness and disorder. And they have no shame about it. New Mayor Eric Adams may be taking a more moderate course, but the progressives are threatening any legislator who dares recognize that “no bail” legislation went too far. We desperately need a check on their power. All indications point to a red wave this November, and we’re confident Zeldin can unify the Republican Party, take back the governor’s mansion, and refill the “veto” pen with ink. The Republican primary was a hard fought and often vicious battle between some passionate candidates. We hope for the good of New York the candidates can now lick their wounds and then unite under the bigger cause of bringing sanity back to this state. The fight begins today.
