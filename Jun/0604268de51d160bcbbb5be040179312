New York gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Giuliani said he’s been banned from appearing in-person at a Monday debate against his GOP primary opponents because he’s refused to provide proof he’s vaccinated against COVID-19. Giuliani, 36, announced he would hold a press conference Sunday morning to “protest vaccine mandates that continue to discriminate against first responders and healthcare workers,” according to a news release. Giuliani has previously touted that he was unvaccinated, but his announcement on Saturday said only he refused to provide proof of his status. The Post has reached out to the campaign on his current vaccination status. The son of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has pledged to end coronavirus mandates and rehire all fired public employees with back pay, said he wrote a letter to CBS executives blasting the station’s decision. “While [your rules] will disrupt Monday’s debate, the true injustice is that policies such as these have deprived front-line heroes such as firefighters, police and healthcare workers of employment and benefits,” the letter read, according to his campaign. Giuliani will appear virtually in the debate against Long Island Rep. Lee Zeldin, former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and businessman Harry Wilson, the release said. The other candidates provided proof of vaccination, according to the Giuliani campaign. An amalgamation of recent polls showed the former White House aide was neck and neck with Zeldin in his bid for the Republican nod. Early voting begins on June 18 ahead of a June 28 primary. WCBS-TV did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Post on Saturday evening.
