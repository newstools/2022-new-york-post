She thought she just needed the toilet. So imagine Jo Bennett’s surprise when she got to the hospital, only to be told that she was actually in labor. Jo took to TikTok to share her story, writing: “Me – these stomach cramps aren’t normal, it can’t just be period pain!” Her husband suggested: “Maybe you need a big poo.” But when she was examined by a doctor, he told her: “You’re not on your period, you’re in labour.” Jo’s video then showed a tiny baby in his bassinet, as well as enjoying some skin-to-skin with his dad. “Surprise surprise,” Jo captioned her video. “Life really does have some funny ways of making all your dreams come true! “He is the miracle baby we never knew we needed.” Women who give birth without knowing they were pregnant are told they had a “cryptic pregnancy”. And people in the comments section were quick to share their own cryptic pregnancy tales. “Had a cryptic pregnancy 7 years ago. She’s currently now sitting on the couch next to me explaining Minecraft in great detail,” one wrote. “Happened to me, with me 2nd daughter, and she was born on my 1st daughters 1st bday,” another added. “Omg midwife here!! How was your surprise? was it a cryptic pregnancy?” a third comment read. To which Jo replied: “Crazy surprise. We had nothing & no plans for children.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
