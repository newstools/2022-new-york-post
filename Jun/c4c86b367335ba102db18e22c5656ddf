A creepy subway perv tried to snap cell phone pictures up the skirt of a 23-year-old woman, police said. The ugly episode unfolded June 14 about 8:35 p.m. inside the subway station at the corner of West 34th Street and 7th Avenue, cops said. The victim was walking up a flight of stairs when the man “got in close proximity to her from behind,” authorities said. The woman turned around to find the creep with his cell phone “taking an up skirt photo,” cops said. The pervert ran off when the stunned woman confronted him, police said. The NYPD on Saturday released surveillance video and a photo of the suspect, an adult 5-foot-10 male, weighing 160 pounds with a medium build, light complexion, brown eyes, and short dark hair. He was last seen wearing a black athletic tank top, light blue jeans and black sneakers, authorities said. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). All calls will remain confidential.
