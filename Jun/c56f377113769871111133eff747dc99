YouTube sensation Jake Paul has blasted “incomprehensible” President Biden over skyrocketing inflation — and declared that anyone who voted for him and doesn’t regret it is part of “the American problem.” The 25-year-old influencer first ripped into the commander-in-chief in a message late Saturday to his 4.3 million followers on Twitter. “Biden accomplishments” he wrote sarcastically, listing “highest gas prices,” “worst inflation,” “plummeting crypto prices,” “highest rent prices ever” and “new incomprehensible language.” “If you’re reading this and voted for Biden and you still don’t regret it then you are the American problem,” insisted the YouTuber whose channel has 20.4 subscribers. He continued the attack Monday as he noted Biden’s latest disastrous standing among young Democrats. Paul tweeted a link to a Morning Consult Political Intelligence tracking report that said only 28% of the youngest Democrats strongly approve of Biden’s job performance, down a whopping 31 points since he took office. “My generation, left or right, agree with me. We need the President of our country to do betr,” wrote Paul, who Forbes said made $45 million on YouTube last year, second only to Mr. Beast. His attack comes as many Democrats see the aging president as a liability who could potentially lose to a Republican. “To say our country was on the right track would flagrantly depart from reality,” Steve Simeonidis, a Democratic National Committee member from Miami, told the New York Times. The president “should announce his intent not to seek re-election in ’24 right after the midterms,” Simeonidis said. Even progressive New York ​Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday refused to say whether she’ll back Biden in a 2024 reelection bid, only saying she would “take a look at it” if he did run again.
