Wild video captures the moment a duo attacked NYPD cops who attempted to arrest a woman blasting music on an East Harlem street Tuesday evening. Felicia Davis, 32, was playing loud music on Madison Avenue near East 105th Street in Manhattan just before 6 p.m. when officers spotted her and told her to stop, according to cops and police sources. When confronted, Davis fled, leaving her speakers behind, cops said. She returned a short time later and refused to provide identification to police — prompting the officers to attempt to take her into custody, authorities said. That sparked the caught-on-video brawl in which another woman and a man attacked the cops trying to arrest Davis, cops said. A woman can be seen grappling with the officers, appearing to spit at them and at one point attempting to hit them, the clip shows. Then a man in a red hoodie is shown coming up behind one of the officers and throwing punches at him. Cops initially tried to run after him but quickly turned back, and he got away. Both Davis and the other woman who allegedly fought with cops, Kimberly Rivera, 33, were arrested and charged with resisting arrest, disrupting governmental administration and disorderly conduct, cops said. The male suspect was still on the loose Wednesday morning, cops said. He is described as having long black hair. In addition to the hoodie, he wore black pants and red shoes.
