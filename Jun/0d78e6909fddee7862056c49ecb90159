There are some threads you don’t want to tug — particularly when that thread is attached to some suspicious looking paraphernalia in your mother-in-law’s house. One woman was left blushing and befuddled while cleaning out her in-law’s cupboards after stumbling across a bizarre, phallic object. “OK, we found 2 of these doily thingies while cleaning out my MILs house,” she shared on Facebook, alongside a photo of an erect object that was covered in a red and pink crochet slip. The increasingly mortified daughter-in-law continued, “Please tell me this is not what we think it is. There has to be an innocent use for them like a candlestick cozy or something??” The puzzling images prompted hundreds of comments on Facebook over the weekend within the closed group Things Found in Walls — And Other Hidden Findings, which boasts over 534,000 members. “I feel like MIL had some adventures,” one follower suggested. Joked another, “It’s a Phallus Flower. Dating back to the Victorian era. They were worn by the upper class men during their dressing with the valet, to provide modesty.” “Sometimes a guy just likes to feel fancy,” one follower claimed. Someone also said they believed the erotic whatchamacallit could be “an early day failed attempt at a condom.” Despite the array of the X-rated comments, the answer was wholly G-rated. Said one Facebook user, “My grandma used to have one” — as others also recognized it  as an old-fashioned dressing for floral bouquet stems.
