Does your neck hurt from hunting down the best deals on travel pillows? Don’t strain yourself anymore because we found it on Amazon, and it’s now 55% off for a limited time. The Trtl Original Pillow is on sale at Amazon, going for $20.39 while supplies last. The pillow normally retails for $45, so the time to shop is right now. Before you book your summer travel plans, picking and packing the right travel pillow is key, and the Trtl — which stands for “Travel Refreshed, Travel Light” — is it. It has more than 28,000 reviews on Amazon alone and has a 98% recommendation rate if you need any more convincing. The pillow itself is machine washable (great for COVID travel) and comes in gray, black, red and coral as part of this Amazon flash sale. It is designed to wrap around the neck and looks like a scarf rather than a bulky foam ring, making airline travel trendy and comfortable too. Like many Amazon sales, act fast as we won’t know when this trendy travel product will sell out. Pro tip: combine this sale with the flash sale happening at JetBlue Vacations and have the ultimate summer vacation ready, planned and packed for. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
