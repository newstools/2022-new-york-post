A Los Angeles man with a lengthy rap sheet has been charged with the shooting death of rapper Slim 400. Michael Lanell Terry, 33, allegedly shot and killed the rising hip-hop star, whose real name is Vincent Cochran, as the rapper was getting out of his vehicle at about 7:50 p.m. on Dec. 8, 2021, in Inglewood, cops said. Terry was charged Monday with murder and gun possession — while a second person, 42-year-old Tamra Lynn Bell, was charged with a felony count of accessory after the fact with knowledge of the crime. Inglewood Police have yet to release a possible motive for the shooting. Terry is being held in jail on a $3,025,000 million bail. Bell is also in jail and held on $1 million bail. Terry has a conviction in 2017 for robbery and one in 2019 for possession of a firearm by a felon. Slim 400, who was born in Germany but grew up in Compton, Calif., was growing his reputation in the West Coast rap scene. Fellow rappers paid tribute to Slim 400 immediately after his death, while disturbing fan-shot videos of the taped-off crime scene were posted on YouTube.
