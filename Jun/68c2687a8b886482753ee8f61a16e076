Phil Mickelson’s unshaven look wasn’t the only change to his appearance as he made his debut on the controversial LIV Golf tour Thursday morning in London. Mickelson, usually sporting KPMG and Workday logos, arrived to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Tour with plain attire. Mickelson has been draped in controversy since his February comments recognizing Saudi Arabian human rights violations, while still showing a willingness to negotiate with the LIV Tour that is financially backed by the country’s regime. Workday, KPMG and club sponsor Callaway decided to drop the six-time major champion. Mickelson hasn’t participated in a PGA Tour event since, making this his first public appearance on a course in four months. It does not appear as if any sponsor has stepped up in the place of those dropped him. Mickelson was donning a hat representing “For Wellness,” his own brand which sells coffee products and golf accessories, and a Polo with a Masters patch. These are his first steps to rebuilding his reputation as he pioneers the LIV Tour with the likes of Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau. Mickelson’s deal to ditch the PGA for LIV was  reportedly worth around $200 million. The sponsor-free Mickelson appears to be in the minority, for now, as most participants are still heavily clad in their branded attire. Most notably, Johnson, teed off in his usual TaylorMade hat and Adidas polo. But the LIV players do share plenty in common. The PGA Tour announced on Thursday morning that all would be suspended from play. The inaugural LIV Golf event — being played at the Centurion Club outside of London — runs through Saturday.
