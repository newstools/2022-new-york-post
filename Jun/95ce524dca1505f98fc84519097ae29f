Gullible TikTok users beware: You may be at risk of getting #Krissed. A new trend is spreading across the app in which users post videos, usually accompanied with false information about celebrities, that end with a video of Kris Jenner dancing to a sped-up version of “Lady Marmalade” from “Moulin Rouge.” The now-viral clip of Jenner in a sparkly green dress and black bow tie originates from an amateur-made music video on the set of the Kardashian-Jenners’ 2011 family Christmas card photo shoot. Uploaded to Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s former YouTube channel, the vid now has more than 4.6 million views. Meanwhile, the hashtag #Krissed currently has over 229 million views on TikTok. At the end of the videos, users often encourage their followers to prank their own friends and family. One example, which has racked up over 7.7 million views, includes a Photoshopped photo seemingly from Kendall’s Instagram grid, claiming the supermodel announced she is pregnant. Before fans can even gather their thoughts, the 818 Tequila owner’s momager pops up. “I got krissed again how do I keep falling for it,” one bamboozled TikTok user commented. “My therapist will be hearing about this,” another quipped.  JoJo Siwa used the bait-and-switch tactic with her 41.7 million TikTok followers. On Wednesday, she falsely announced that she would be taking a break from public life before the dancing Jenner took over the screen. “No way did I just get Krissed by Jojo Siwa,” one user commented. “I WAS TYPING OUT A PARAGRAPH ON HOW YOU DESERVE A NICE BREAK AND AS SOON AS I SAW KRIS I WAS LIKE ,” another admitted. Some are deeming the new trend this generation’s version of “Rickrolling.” If unfamiliar, the phrase refers to people who are tricked into clicking on a hyperlink that leads to the music video for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up.” The clip has since reached more than 1 billion views on YouTube. The Post has reached out to Kris Jenner’s representatives for comment.
