But unlike Pence — who didn’t notice the massive bug buzzing about — Suozzi swiped his hand across his face trying to catch it. “I caught the fly and crushed it, just like I’ll crush the crime crisis!” Suozzi told The Post in a phone call after the debate ended. Hochul slammed Suozzi for backtracking controversial comments he made in support of the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill barring gender identity and sexual orientation discussions in the classroom signed into law by Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Long Island pol was visibility disturbed – both in his failing efforts to capture Hochul’s attention and by the pesky creature flying around his head.
