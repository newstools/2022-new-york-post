Horrifying video captured the moment a zookeeper in Mexico was mauled by a tiger during feeding time – before being rushed to a hospital, where he reportedly died of a heart attack. Jose de Jesus, 23, screamed in agony as the tiger bit his hand after he tried to pet the big cat at the zoo in Periban, western Mexico, graphic footage published by the Mirror Wednesday shows. De Jesus was rushed to a hospital, where he refused to allow doctors to amputate his badly mangled hand before dying of a heart attack, according to the outlet. The animal’s owner reportedly released the gruesome footage to show that the worker was at fault for the attack. The owner also said he had paid the victim’s medical bills, the Mirror reported. Officials were looking into whether the owner, who also reportedly has a lion and a crocodile at the zoo, had permission from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources to keep the animals there, the outlet said.
