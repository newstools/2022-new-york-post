A man was struck with a wrench in an unprovoked attack on a Bronx train this week, cops said. The 53-year-old victim was on a D train at the 167th Street station in Highbridge around 8:30 p.m. Monday when a stranger approached him and struck him in the hand with a wrench without provocation, authorities said late Thursday. The victim, who suffered a cut on his hand, was taken to BronxCare Hospital in stable condition, authorities said. Cops released photos of the suspect, who remained at large Friday. The incident came the day before a good Samaritan was headbutted and whacked with a hockey stick at a Queens train station. Two straphangers were also attacked this week near the York Street station in Brooklyn – by assailants who spewed anti-Asian comments.
