This playing card optical illusion has sent social media users in a spin as they realize the glaringly obvious feature. Despite using decks of cards for years, many people have been left baffled over the design of one of the cards. The space between the diamonds on the eight card resembles the number itself. It shocked Twitter users who said they were “today years old” when they spotted the clever trick. The card is the only one in the deck with the secret feature. One user wrote: “What kind of mad magic is this? Another said: “Now that I’ve made my eyes see it, I can’t fix my eyes to un-see it.” A third commented: “How have I not seen that before?!” It comes after an optical illusion called on viewers to spot the single bucket and spade hidden among the winter clothes. At first glance, the puzzle might look straightforward enough — but it’s much tougher than it appears. Tucked away amid rows of knitted jumpers, hats and scarves sits two items much better suited for a summertime trip to the beach. It follows another tough puzzle which was built as the perfect boredom buster — but with a special twist. Inside the picture of an office sits five hidden ingredients that are essential to making the perfect hot beverage. Most people find the five items with an average speed of two minutes and 35 seconds. The quickest time someone has found all of the hot beverage ingredients is one minute and 46 seconds. Another tricky illusion is challenging viewers to see how quickly they can count all the coffee mugs in a picture — but can you beat the record time? The picture shows many vessels perfect of nurturing an early morning cup of coffee or tea — and viewers have to count how many they can see. The average time to find all the mugs is two minutes and 47 seconds, but the quickest is one minute and 54 seconds. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
