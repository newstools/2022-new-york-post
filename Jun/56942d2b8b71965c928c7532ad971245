The Giants and Braves will play the second of a four-game series tonight in Atlanta, and Sean Zerillo of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The Braves claimed the series opener 2-1 on Monday, and Zerillo believes they’re worth backing tonight. However, rather than taking the Braves for the full game, Zerillo is opting to back them on the moneyline for the first five innings Zerillo’s thesis in backing the Braves for the first five innings comes down to advantage in the starting pitcher matchup: Spencer Strider for the Braves vs. Anthony DeSclafani for the Giants. “Strider has been phenomenal lately — particularly his last two starts,” Zerillo says. “And if you filter out pitchers with a minimum of 40 innings pitchers, he actually ranks third in swinging strike rate.” Plus, Strider has avoided falling behind in the count and pitching into deep counts over his last two starts, leading Zerillo to believe his command has improved. On the flip-side, Zerillo doesn’t believe Giants starting pitcher DeSclafani has been as bad as his 6.08 ERA indicates, especially considering he owns a 4.12 xERA and .287 xBA. However, those underlying indicators haven’t really moved at all in recent starts and DeSclafani has posted a .444 batting average against on balls in play this season.   For those reasons, Zerillo is willing to back the Braves F5 moneyline at -168 or better. At the time of writing, WynnBet Sportsbook has this play at -165. Zerillo also leans to the full-game under 9.5 and the first-five innings under 5 for those bettors interested in a total.
