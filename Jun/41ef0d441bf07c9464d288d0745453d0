A Manhattan parking garage employee was injured after he got stuck in an elevator shaft, officials said. The elevator episode unfolded at 8:20 a.m. at the Townhouse garage at 177 East 73rd St., between Third and Lexington avenue, authorities said. “He got caught up in between floors. We think he injured his leg, but he’s fine,” the parking garage manager Junior Almonte, 48, told The Post on Saturday. According to the FDNY, the attendant was pinned in the elevator shaft of a parking garage elevator car lift until department technical rescue workers freed him in less than an hour. The 46-year-old was taken to Cornell Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. At the scene, FDNY found the employee “pinned from the waist down and screaming in pain,” Rescue 1 Officer Capt. John Ceriello said in a statement. FDNY sent members into the elevator car via an open hoistway door and decided they would cut holes through the sides of the metal elevator car with an electric saw. “At the same time a car was hanging precariously from the floor above onto the top of the elevator car,” Ceriello said. Firefighters secured the vehicle and the elevator car as they worked to free the man, who “went in and out of consciousness” as they began cutting. “As the cuts relieved the victim of the entrapment, the five firefighters pulled back the panels, cautiously laid the victim onto the top of the car inside the elevator lift, and was secured to a backboard,” he said. He was then carefully lowered by hand from the elevator car to the first floor of the parking garage, where FDNY and EMS members were waiting with a stretcher. The garage was not accepting cars as of mid-Saturday afternoon due to “elevator issues,” a worker said, adding city elevator and building inspectors were on the scene.
