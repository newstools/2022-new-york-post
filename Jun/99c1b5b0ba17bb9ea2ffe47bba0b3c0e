Ben Simmons said Thursday that he was “feeling incredible.” It remains to be seen if that sentiment will still hold true this evening. Hours before Kevin Durant requested a trade from the Nets in an NBA bombshell, Simmons posted a black-and-white photo of himself clad in front of his locker, clad in Brooklyn gear. “Feeling incredible,” the 25-year-old captioned the post, which he shared in an Instagram Story. Simmons, who was traded to the Nets by the 76ers at the February deadline, underwent back surgery in May after missing the entire 2021-22 season. A source close to the three-time NBA All-Star confirmed to The Post in June that he’s started the rehab phase and is right on schedule to be ready for training camp. Although the upcoming season will be a crucial one for Simmons, it remains to be seen just who will be part of his supporting cast. With Durant all but out of Brooklyn after three years, the Nets have since sent a first-round pick to the Jazz for Royce O’Neale. Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving opted into the final year of his contract with the Nets despite a standoff with the team earlier this month. One suspects that if Durant gets traded, Irving will be the next out the door. Brooklyn was swept by Boston in the first round of the NBA playoffs, with the Celtics ultimately advancing to this year’s Finals against Golden State. The Warriors went on to win the title.
