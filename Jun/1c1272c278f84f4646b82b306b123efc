Anthony Rizzo knows the defensive metrics available to the public aren’t doing him any favors. According to Fangraphs, since being credited with a career-best 13 defensive runs saved in 2016, the Yankees first baseman has had a steady decline in the category, bottoming out at -6 DRS last season. And this year, he’s already at minus-4, among the worst in the majors. Statcast treats him no better, registering a minus-4 outs above average for Rizzo and minus-3 runs prevented. Only three first basemen rank lower. “I feel like when it comes to those numbers, first basemen kind of get [screwed],” Rizzo said. “I don’t think they measure footwork around the bag, not coming off the [base]. I don’t really know how it all works or what makes someone good or bad.”
