President Biden announced new sanctions Thursday targeting both influential Russians and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s yachts on the 99th day of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine — but still missing from the list are two oligarchs connected to first son Hunter Biden. The slow rollout of sanctions comes despite Biden threatening “swift and severe” action ahead of the invasion. New US-targeted individuals include the oligarch Alexey Mordashov, Putin-linked money manager Sergei Roldugin, billionaire God Nisanov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria  Zakharova. The Treasury Department said it had also sanctioned two yachts as properties that Putin has “an interest” in — the Russia-flagged Graceful and Cayman Islands-flagged Olympia. It’s unclear why the first son’s Russian business associates — including the oligarchs Yelena Baturina and Vladimir Yevtushenko — have been spared from sanctions leveled by Washington against many other members of Russia’s business elite. Baturina in 2014 paid a firm associated with Hunter Biden $3.5 million, according to a 2020 report written by Republican-led Senate committees. She is the widow of Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov and documents from Hunter Biden’s laptop indicate she may have attended a 2015 dinner in DC with then-Vice President Biden. Yevtushenkov, meanwhile, faces UK sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but hasn’t yet been targeted by the US. He reportedly dined with Hunter Biden in 2012 at Moscow’s Ritz-Carlton hotel. This is a developing story.
