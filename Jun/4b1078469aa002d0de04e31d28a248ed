The sports car that can zoom up to 200 mph, but the driver couldn’t get away faster. A totaled 2020 McLaren 600 LT was left on the side of the road in Washington state after its owner seemed willing to flee from the more than $200,000 luxury sports car. The sleek and pricey coupe can reach speeds of up to 124 MPH in less than 10 seconds, though it came to a halt after apparently crashing into a guard rail along State Road 512 near Tacoma, according to Washington State authorities. The state police tweeted out photos of the destroyed white McLaren early Tuesday morning and said troopers were investigating the hit-and-run accident. When another Twitter user asked if there were injuries, Trooper Robert Reyer replied, “We aren’t sure. The driver fled the scene!” Photos show the car, which can be priced north of $250,000, wedged under the guard rail with its scissor door open on the driver’s side. Trooper John Dattilo told the Oregonian Wednesday that authorities haven’t found the owner of the car, which can reach 62 MPH in 2.9 seconds. It was towed away Monday night, according to the newspaper. “This kind of crash happens all the time, where people don’t want to get in trouble so they leave the car behind,” Dattilo told the Oregonian. “But it’s not necessarily common for it to be a $200,000 McLaren, though.” The car, which still had dealership plates, wasn’t reported stolen and its registered owner lives in Washington, Dattilo said, according to the outlet.
