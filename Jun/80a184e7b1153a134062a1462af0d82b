The multi-talented Neil Patrick Harris is the latest addition to the BBC’s “Doctor Who” 60th anniversary episode. The “How I Met Your Mother” alum will star alongside David Tennant and Catherine Tate as they reprise their roles on the hit British show. Former “Doctor” showrunner Russell T. Davies, who will also return for the episode, posted a picture of Harris in character to Instagram Monday. “Neil Patrick Harris, welcome to Cardiff,” he wrote. “Playing the greatest enemy the Doctor has ever faced. Such a great actor, such a great man, it’s an honor and a hoot. Have fun!” The full anniversary show cast has yet to be announced, but Bernard Cribbins and Jacqueline King were spotted on set in Camden Market, where the show was filming, in May. Later this year will mark the end of actor Jodie Whittaker’s time as the 13th Doctor. “Sex Education” star Ncuti Gatwa, will take over as the 14th regeneration in May. Gatwa said that “Heartstopper’s” Yasmin Finney would be joining the cast as a character named Rose. It is not readily clear who Rose is, but some fans think she may be Donna Noble’s daughter. The “Doctor Who: 60th Anniversary special” will be released sometime in 2023.
