Zach Wilson has made his way to The Bronx. The Jets quarterback, previously seen at a Mets game in May, took in the Yankees’ 4-3 win over the Rays at Yankees Stadium on Wednesday night. Seated next to a mystery blonde — she did not appear to be ex-girlfriend Abbey Gile or the unidentified woman from a jaunt to Miami in March — Wilson took part in the wave as it went around the stadium. Well, sort of, anyway. Wilson wasn’t the only Jet in attendance. The Bombers welcomed several members of Gang Green on Wednesday: Tyler Conklin, CJ Uzomah, Conor McDermott, Mike White and Dan Feeney all took in the action Wilson and his teammates have made appearances throughout the New York sports scene, cheering on the Islanders, Rangers, Knicks, Nets, Mets and Yankees. It’s a big season coming up for Wilson, with Year 2 on the horizon and hopes raised as the team goes through its June camp. “I feel I can be one of the best,” Wilson told reporters on Wednesday. “And if you don’t say that you’re not a true competitor.”
