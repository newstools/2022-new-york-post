The Warriors trolled everyone — even one another — at the team’s championship parade in San Francisco on Monday. Klay Thompson called out Stephen Curry for his tearful reaction when the longtime duo won their fourth title in eight years against the Celtics last Thursday. “Who cries on the basketball court?” Thompson said in front of a packed crowd on the streets of San Francisco. The team was reflecting on the star point guard’s uncharacteristic emotional moment on the court after the Warriors beat the Celtics 103-90 in Game 6 in Boston. “There’s no crying in basketball,” Curry said, laughing. Cameras captured Curry crying in his father’s arms after the game, and also filmed him sitting on the court in tears. Curry said collecting his fourth ring “hit different,” while celebrating on the court at TD Garden. The 34-year-old took home the Finals MVP award for the first time in his career to complete his MVP collection. Curry tweeted a photo of himself at the Warriors parade with a cigar in his mouth, posing with the Larry O’Brien championship trophy, his 2022 Finals MVP trophy and his 2022 All-Star MVP trophy. “What they gonna say now???” he tweeted. At the parade on Monday, Curry rocked a necklace with his three championship rings, and posed for a photo with Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who wore a “Night Night” shirt — which is Curry’s famous line when he’s shooting lights out.
