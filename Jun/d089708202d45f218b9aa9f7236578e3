For the sixth time this season, the New York Rangers will have their backs against the wall in an elimination game. The Blueshirts admirably fought back against the Pittsburgh Penguins and Carolina Hurricanes in Rounds 1 and 2. It will be a different task to repeat the feat against Andrei Vasilevskiy and the two-time defending champions — especially if Brayden Point draws back into the lineup. After a bit of an uncharacteristic Game 1 that saw the Rangers win, 6-2, this series has settled into what most folks thought it would look like. There’s very little room on the ice and both goaltenders are playing at an elite level. The Under has hit in every game since the series opener. It cashed in all four games of Tampa Bay’s Round 2 sweep of the Panthers and in five of the seven tilts in Rangers-Hurricanes. In other words, the Under is 13-3 in the past 16 contests featuring either, or both, of these teams. That trend, combined with the defensive style both teams are playing, and the fact that Igor Shesterkin and Vasilevskiy are in great form, means we will see a very inflated Under for Game 6. The simple thing to do is go back to the well for another under bet, but you’re paying quite the premium at this point. Additionally, there are some signals that Tampa Bay’s offense is starting to round into form. The Bolts have created 67 high-danger scoring chances at 5-on-5 in this series and after failing to convert on 39 of their first 40 HDCF, Tampa Bay has started to find the back of the net when given the opportunity. In betting, it often pays to zag when everyone else zigs. You’re going to get a great number on Game 6 going Over the total. Take it. The play: Over 5.5 (+120)
