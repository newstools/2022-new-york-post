Hugh Jackman has contracted COVID-19 for a second time, one day after his live performance at the Tony Awards. Jackman, who has been starring in Meredith Wilson’s “The Music Man” on Broadway, announced that he tested positive on Instagram Monday and said standby actor Max Clayton will step into the role of Harold Hill in his place. “I wanted you guys to hear it from me first that unfortunately, this morning I have frustratingly tested positive for COVID again, so my incredible standby Max Clayton is going to go on for me,” he said in a video statement. The 53-year-old actor and his Broadway co-star Sutton Foster performed a number from “The Music Man” at the Tony Awards Sunday. Their revival of the classic musical received six nominations but took home no awards. Jackman tested positive for COVID-19 for the first time in late December 2021 and sat out a number of performances with Clayton performing in his place then as well. The standby will again perform in the Broadway show beginning tomorrow, June 14. Jackman is expected to return to the stage at the Winter Garden Theatre on June 22, according to the show’s Instagram page. Jackman said he has worked on the part of Harold Hill alongside Clayton for more than two years and called him “absolutely extraordinary.” “I’m just frustrated that I won’t get to see him and cheer him on, but I will be cheering you on in my heart, Max,” he said. Jackman praised standbys, understudies and swings in his remarks. “This is just another reminder to me — and I’ll say it a million times over — that the real heroes of Broadway are our standbys, our understudies and swings and never has that been more obvious than in the past year,” he said. “They give meaning to the phrase ‘the show must go on’ and it will go on and it’ll be amazing.”
