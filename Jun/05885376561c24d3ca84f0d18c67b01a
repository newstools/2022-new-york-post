Down 3-1, the Rangers won three straight to beat the Penguins. Down 2-0 and then 3-2, the Rangers came back to take down the Hurricanes. They will now try and do it for a third straight time against the Lightning. Game 5 was a tough loss to swallow for the Blueshirts, falling in the final minutes once again. They now head to Tampa for Game 6 Saturday and hope to bring the series back to a rowdy MSG for Game 7. While it was a saddening loss to Rangers fans, the motto has been “No quit in NY” this season. This series is not over yet. To relive what happened in Game 5, look ahead to Game 6 and talk everything Rangers, we present to you the first-ever live edition of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast, recorded from American Whiskey around the corner from The Garden. Ron Duguay and I were joined by special guest and ex-Rangers forward Nick Fotiu.
