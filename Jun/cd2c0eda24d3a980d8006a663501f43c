President Biden is muddying the waters in the argument over gender-affirming care for kids. His Wednesday executive order on LGBTQ issues moved against the discredited techniques once used to “cure” gay teenagers, even as it charged “the Department of Health and Human Services . . . with protecting LGBTQI+ children and families from attacks on their access to health care.” Sure seems like the White House is implying that opposing conversion therapy also means opposing justified skepticism around life-altering hormone treatments and irreversible surgeries for kids. Families of LGBTQ kids should “let them be themselves,” said the president in his speech on the executive order. Absolutely: Gay and trans people deserve respect and inclusion. But that does not mean pumping pre-teens full of chemicals at the drop of a hat. Especially given that many are far too young to be sure they actually want to transition permanently. Thundering about the phantom menace of conversion therapy makes the whole thing look like a cynical ploy to tar the likes of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who’s opposing radical propaganda (masked as “affirmation”) aimed at toddlers. And pushing, as the Biden administration has done, to make sure kids can access these treatments (even without significant parent involvement) is irresponsible and unethical. A mountain of evidence suggests these treatments should be used only for the most serious gender dysphoria — not handed out like Halloween candy. Shame on the president for pandering to the gender radicals in his party.
