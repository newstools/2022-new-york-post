Paige Spiranac and Isabelle Shee are the most notable names in the golf influencer space, but a new social media sensation is quickly rising up the ranks. Meet Claire Hogle, a fellow golf influencer who has “already earned comparisons to Paige Spiranac,” according to the UK’s Daily Star. With over 500,000 Instagram followers and counting, Hogle — who says she’s a “huge golf gal” — frequently posts photos of herself from the course, which she first “fell in love with” as a teen. “When i fell in love with the game at age 14, i was often the only girl at the course, always wishing i had other girls to play with. In the past couple of years, I’ve seen so many women take up the game and my circle of golf sisters has grown to include some of my closest friends,” Hogle recently posted on Instagram in recognition of Women’s Golf Day. “Golf has absolutely changed my life and it is truly so fun to see more women and girls enjoying this wonderful game. cheers to all my women in golf!” Hogle, who hails from San Diego, competed at the collegiate level during her time at California State University San Marcos. Though she played the sport throughout her freshman, sophomore, and junior years, her senior season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-21. “And that’s a wrap!! Incredibly grateful for these past four years as a Cougar,” Hogle posted on Instagram in June 2021. “Thanks to my coaches, teammates, family, & friends who made it so memorable and helped me out along the way. Now, time to figure out how to do life as a big girl in the real world!” Since graduating from college, Hogel has continued to grow her online following both on TikTok and YouTube, where she shares videos of her playful matches, in addition to golf tips. In between posting content, you’re most likely to find Hogle at her “happy place,” on the course.
