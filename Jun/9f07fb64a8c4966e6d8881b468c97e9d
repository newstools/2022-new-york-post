A California man allegedly held a woman captive for five months at his home — where he subjected her to horrific torture by repeatedly raping her, cutting her tongue, putting out an eye and disfiguring her face, authorities said. Peter Anthony McGuire, 59, is facing a slew of charges, from rape and kidnapping to sodomy, torture and false imprisonment, for his alleged brutal treatment of the 22-year old woman, whom he started abusing after she moved into his Chino HIlls, Calif., home. “Very soon after moving into the house she was not allowed to leave, she was held there against her will by him and at that point was subjected to multiple assaults,”  San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Mara Rodriguez told ABC7. According to the criminal complaint, McGuire “Did unlawfully and maliciously deprive Jane/John Doe of a member of the body and did disable, disfigure and render it useless and did cut and disable the tongue, and put out an eye and slit the nose, ear and lip of said person.” The woman was somehow able to flee the home and was spotted by bystanders at a nearby park around 7:20 p.m. June 9. She was taken to a local hospital, where she is being treated and is in stable condition, San Bernardino District Attorney’s Office officials said. An arrest warrant was issued for McGuire, but he fled his home and was caught two days later by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and the sheriff’s Specialized Enforcement Division. McGuire initially barricaded himself at a home in Placentia, Calif., but eventually surrendered, sheriff’s officials said. McGuire pleaded not guilty to all the charges and special allegations during an arraignment at San Bernardino court on Monday.  He remains in jail under a no bail hold, according to court records.
