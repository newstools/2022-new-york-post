The WynnBET mobile app is powered by software from European sports betting operator BetBull, which Wynn Resorts acquired in 2020 to form Wynn Interactive. WynnBET has not yet implemented the same social aspects into its mobile app, though. The current iteration of the WynnBET app does not offer much beyond a simple listing of sports, odds displays, and a bet slip to track pending wagers. However, this is not at all bad news, as it makes it dead easy for you to place your wagers and find what you’re looking for. A horizontal navigation menu near the top of the app provides links to jump to specific sports. A secondary menu hidden near the top-left corner of the app provides links to visit outstanding bets, banking history, account settings, the cashier, and customer support. When compared to other betting apps, WynnBET lacks in most areas. The overall design is nothing to write home about, but makes for a simple experience.

WynnBET will need to up its game in several key aspects if it wishes to compete effectively against the likes of FanDuel, Caesars, and BetMGM sportsbook.

Additionally, its acquisition of BetBull in 2020 may pave the way for a highly social betting experience, which would be unique in an industry dominated by sportsbooks that closely resemble one another in look and function. For experienced bettors, sharp lines with low margins are probably the most important thing to consider. WynnBet delivers competitive odds in every market and often stands out with the best prices. The juice is often very strong at WynnBet, with spread and totals lines often priced at -105, a great factor in the long run. As a result, bettors can stand to win more money by choosing WynnBET.

Compared to other online betting sites, WynnBet has limited markets when it comes to betting on sports. Moneyline, Spread and Totals markets are all available, but you’ll struggle to find many of the niche markets you may find at FanDuel or Caesars.
