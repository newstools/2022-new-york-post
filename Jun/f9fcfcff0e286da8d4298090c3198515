Drake announced his seventh studio album Thursday and fans didn’t have to wait long to listen. “HONESTLY, NEVERMIND” dropped at midnight. It’s the “Nice For What” rapper’s second release in less than a year. “Certified Lover Boy” — with its widely derided cover art depicting pregnant women — dropped on Sept. 2, delivering instant classics like “Way 2 Sexy” and “Knife Talk.” Fans — some famous ones — showed their fever and support by suggesting that his new record will be a perfect way to kick off the summer. “Get your spritzers ready,” commented DJ Khaled on Instagram, while Drake collaborator Gordo declared it would be “the greatest dance album of all time” and enthusiastic Canadian soccer star Jahkeele Marshall-Rutty offered, “Summer has officially started.” The sudden news comes hours after British Vogue cover queen Beyoncé announced her new album, “Renaissance,” is coming on July 29 — presumably setting off a race for Drake to drop his record as soon as possible. “Drake rushing to release his new album before Beyoncé releases,” one Twitter user joked with a clip of a mass of people sprinting.
