The Dallas Cowboys have been the subject of NFL ridicule for decades. The weather report is no longer a safe place for them. On Monday, Ethan Bird of WTOK-TV in Meridian, Miss., took his opportunity to get a quick dig in on the Cowboys during the live broadcast. What started as a regular 10-day forecast, quickly turned into savage roast of the NFL team. “It’s looking a little bit like those Dallas Cowboys, peaking in the 90s,” Bird said of the upcoming weather. Bird, a sports anchor and occasional weatherman for the station, has received plenty of attention for the clip. “This is why you don’t let the sports guy do weather,” he tweeted with a crying laughing emoji.
