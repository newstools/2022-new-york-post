Aidan Hutchinson’s sister, Aria Hutchinson, is giving fans a peek at her Miss Michigan USA journey. Aria, the sister of Detroit Lions rookie defensive end, took to Instagram over the weekend to chronicle her stay in Cancun, Mexico, for her Miss USA orientation, one month after being crowned Miss Michigan USA. “Cannot believe I get to spend my 1 month anniversary as Miss Michigan USA in Cancun this weekend for the @missusa orientation!! what a dream!! feeling ecstatic and grateful… and then some,” she gushed on Instagram. Aria later posted swimsuit snaps from the scenic locale, telling her Instagram followers on Sunday that she’s “bringing the heat to @nizucresort.” “OKAAAAAY Michigan!!!! Bring that heat!” one follower exclaimed in the comments while another replied, “Cover of SI Swimsuit 2023? Daaaam.” Aria also spent quality time with Miss Ohio USA Sir’Quora Carroll, who joked about her friendship with the Wolverines fan. “f you ask me she looks like a buckeye fan  who said Ohio and Michigan couldn’t get along #bettertogether,” Carroll posted Saturday on Instagram, to which Aria replied, “IM QUAKING but we look so cute that I don’t even care.” It’s been a life-changing spring for the Hutchinson family, who not only celebrated Aria being named Miss Michigan USA in May but celebrated Aidan — who starred for the Michigan Wolverines — being drafted by the Lions a month earlier. In April, Aria and her family jetted to Las Vegas, where Detroit selected Aidan No. 2 overall in the 2022 NFL Draft. Melissa Hutchinson, the matriarch of the family, later joked on Instagram about how quickly the Lions made the call to her son. “They weren’t lying when they said Detroit wasted no time,” Melissa quipped in May. “PS do u know how HARD it was to stay silent?!! I felt like I was in A Quiet Place!”
