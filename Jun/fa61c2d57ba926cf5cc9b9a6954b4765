Queen Elizabeth II made multiple appearances Sunday at her Platinum Jubilee Pageant — first as a hologram waving from inside a golden carriage on the streets of London, then on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a rendition of “God Save the Queen.” The startling digitized younger version of the 96-year-old monarch surfaced ahead of her in-person appearance. The hologram was part of a carnivalesque parade celebrating the beloved queen’s 70-year reign. Her image was beamed into the 260-year golden carriage, which she had ridden to and from her coronation in 1953, as it was pulled by a team of royal white horses through the street, according to Sky News. The coach led a 3-mile parade that was set to include some 6,000 performers, including pop singer Ed Sheeran. At the pageant’s conclusion, Elizabeth briefly appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton and their three kids. The crowd sang “God Save the Queen” before the monarch and her family retired back into the palace. Elizabeth, who had spent all of Saturday at home watching the celebrations, tweeted in a statement after the festivities that she was “humbled and deeply touched that so many people have taken to the streets to celebrate my Platinum Jubilee. “While I may not have attended every event in person, my heart has been with you all,” the monarch said. “When it comes to how to mark seventy years as your Queen, there is no guidebook to follow. It really is a first,” she said. “I remain committed to serving you to the best of my ability, supported by my family.” Additional reporting by Sara Nathan
