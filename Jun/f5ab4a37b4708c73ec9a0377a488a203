A Colorado Christian crisis center for pregnant women was vandalized and set on fire Saturday morning, a day after the US Supreme Court reversed federal protection of abortions. Police responded to a fire at Life Choices in Longmont around 3:20 a.m., and found the building ablaze with covered with graffiti messages referencing the controversial overturning of Roe v. Wade, officials said. “If abortions aren’t safe neither are you,” one message read, accompanied by the circled “A” anarchy symbol. The saying has been written at dozens of pro-life centers since the court’s intent to overturn the 1973 ruling was leaked in May. “Bans off our bodies,” was also painted onto the entrance walkway of the building while another anarchy symbol adorned its façade, according to pictures released by police. Life Choices offers women alternatives to abortion as well as faith-based post-abortion counseling, according to its website.

The building suffered heavy fire and smoke damage, and police were scouring surveillance footage in the area as they searched for the arson suspect or suspects. The reversal of Roe v. Wade is expected to lead to abortion bans in about half the US states, but would not immediately affect Colorado, which currently grants pregnant residents wide access to the procedure.
