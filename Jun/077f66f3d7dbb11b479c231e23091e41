Isiah Kiner-Falefa was not insulting his former team. He was speaking factually, with evidence to support the notion. In the infielder’s four seasons in Texas, the Rangers went 158-234 in games he played in. They never sniffed .500, peaking with 78 wins in 2019. They lost 102 games last season, when they finished last in their division for the third time in four years. “A loss was normal,” Kiner-Falefa said Tuesday. “[The Yankees] don’t ever expect to lose, and if we do, it happens. But you expect to win every day. … I think last year [with the Rangers], we lost a game, you’re going [into] the next day not expecting to win.” There was no panicking. There were not the same expectations that exist in every single game he plays in pinstripes. When you lose 63 percent of the games you play, as the Rangers did last season, the dreaded becomes commonplace.
