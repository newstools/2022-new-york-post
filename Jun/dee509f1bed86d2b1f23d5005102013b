Building through the draft is in vogue in the NBA. The current versions of the Celtics and Warriors, who will meet in the NBA Finals beginning tonight, have done alright without having a major free-agent import. Boston’s Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and Grant Williams are all homegrown products. The Warriors’ draft-pick stalwarts start with Stephen Curry and end with Jordan Poole, taken with the 28th pick in 2019. Draymond Green (2012) was a second-rounder at No. 35 overall and Klay Thompson (2011) was selected in the late lottery at No. 11, where the Knicks are situated for this year’s draft on June 23. In 2009, Curry was drafted with the No. 7 pick, one spot ahead of the Knicks, who took Jordan Hill as a bitter consolation prize. At least the Knicks were onto Curry — so much so that the Curry-to-the-Knicks hype influenced the Warriors’ decision-making, Knicks owner James Dolan believes.
