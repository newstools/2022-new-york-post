Cameron Diaz is coming out of retirement. The 49-year-old actress — who retired from acting in 2018 — will star in the upcoming Netflix movie “Back In Action” alongside Jamie Foxx, 54. Foxx shared the news on Twitter Tuesday, along with a recorded phone call between the  “Charlie’s Angels” star and Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady, who knows a thing or two about un-retiring. Netflix confirmed the project to The Post, and a representative for Diaz told The Post that the “project is happening but there’s no release date yet.” The Post has also reached out to reps for Foxx. “Cameron I hope you aren’t mad I recorded this, but no turning back now,” Foxx tweeted in the announcement. “Had to call in the GOAT to bring back another GOAT. @CameronDiaz and I are BACK IN ACTION – our new movie with @NetflixFilm. Production starting later this year!!” In the call, “There’s Something About Mary” star Diaz said she felt “so anxious right now. I’m, like pacing the room.” When pressed on her mood by Foxx, she replied: “I feel excited, but I don’t know how to do this, ya know?” Foxx then said he understood and let her know that he had “somebody on the other line that can help you with this” before dialing in Brady. “I’m relatively successful at un-retiring,” six-time Super Bowl champion Brady declared in the recording. “Honestly … exactly what I needed,” a seemingly shocked and admittedly nervous Diaz said. “Well, guys, I’m gonna jump off and let you guys chat it up,” Foxx said. “Perfect,” replied Brady, whose short-lived retirement earlier this year lasted just 40 days before he decided to return to Tampa Bay. “We’ll take it from here.” Diaz and Foxx previously worked with each other on the sports drama “Any Given Sunday” in 1999 and the “Annie” remake in 2014. No plot details for “Back In Action” have been released, “Horrible Bosses” director Seth Gordon will also direct the movie as he wrote the script with Brendan O’Brien.
