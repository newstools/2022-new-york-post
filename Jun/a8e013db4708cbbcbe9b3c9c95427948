A woman was gored by a bison at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming after she approached the animal Monday morning, parks officials said. The unidentified 25-year-old from Grove City, Ohio walked towards the bovine as it neared a boardwalk just north of Old Faithful, according to a press release. As she got within ten feet of the animal, it gored her and tossed her ten feet into the air, officials said. The victim suffered a puncture wound and other injuries and was taken to a hospital, authorities said. Yellowstone visitors are advised to stay at least 75 feet away from large animals like bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes and at least 300 feet away from bears and wolves. “Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans,” parks officials warned.
