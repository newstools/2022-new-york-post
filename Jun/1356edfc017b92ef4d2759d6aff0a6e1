A Brooklyn man who did 17 years in prison for murder before being exonerated last year landed back behind bars Tuesday — for groping a woman and packing an illegal gun, police sources told The Post. James Davis, 39 — who was convicted in the 2004 shooting death of a man at a Brooklyn party before he was cleared and freed in 2021 — was picked up by cops in Manhattan on Tuesday after he allegedly grabbed a woman’s buttocks —  and was found to also have an illicit, loaded Ruger .380-caliber handgun on him, sources said. Davis was 21 when he was charged with killing Blake Harper in 2004 in a beef over a woman during a party at a Masonic lodge. Davis claimed he left the party before the shooting but was identified as the gunman by a woman at the party, WPIX TV said in a report after his release last year. Three other witnesses also picked Davis out of a lineup, and he was convicted two years later. But Davis’ Legal Aid lawyers sought to overturn the conviction, claiming he just bore a resemblance to the actual killer and that his first lawyer failed to interview other witnesses who could have cleared him in the case. In April 2021, they won their bid, and Davis was freed, with the Brooklyn DA’s Office eventually saying he would not be retried. Davis appears to have kept his nose clean until Tuesday, when police say he was walking near 34th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan around 9:20 a.m. when he allegedly grabbed the woman, the sources said. When cops searched him, he was carrying the loaded gun, they said. Davis faces at least two counts of criminal possession of a weapon and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance, police sources said.
