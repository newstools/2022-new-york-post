A woman has been left red-faced after trying to spice up her relationship with her husband – only for the plan to awkwardly backfire. Mackenzie Lynn Smith, who is from the US, took to TikTok and shared a short clip where she explains that she decided to get in her husband’s car wearing nothing but a very revealing black lace bodysuit. Only, she was left mortified moments later when she spotted her husband’s grandmother sitting in the backseat. In the video, Mackenzie says: “I’m going to get changed. He’s going to be here in a couple of minutes. Let’s hope he likes it.” Next, she’s seen rushing out of the garage donning a very sexy piece of lingerie as she tries to avoid the gaze of any neighbours. It’s only when she tries to get into the car that the penny drops, as she realizes her husband isn’t alone. While her husband’s grandma appears visibly shocked, Mackenzie says she had the perfect response and joked: “Well, hi sweety, don’t you look cute.” The post has since gone viral and racked up an impressive 16.5 million. views – and has been inundated with comments from very amused social media users. “’Don’t you look cute’ aww granny,” wrote one. A second commented: “omg I would have ran and hide under the covers for a week.” A third penned: “You can see the tears about to form out of pure embarrassment bro.” And another quipped: “”And she was worried about the neighbors.” A further added: “WHEN I TELL U MY HAND FLEW TO MY MOUTH.” One more joked: “He’s trying to hide the shame while grandma approves the outfit hahahahahaha I can’t.” Elsewhere, others cast down on whether the video was staged, suggesting the awkward situation is far to embarrassing to be true. “I wanna say it’s staged but he’s in literal tears,” one social media user noted.
