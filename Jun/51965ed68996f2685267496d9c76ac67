The family of Baltimore Ravens linebacker Jaylon Ferguson released a statement addressing reports about his cause of death. In the statement shared on Twitter by Doni Smith, Ferguson’s fiancée, the family said “despite the speculation in earlier reports, at this point in time the cause of Jaylon’s death has yet to be determined.” Baltimore police said they found Ferguson unresponsive at a home in the 400 block of Ilchester Avenue in Baltimore’s Harwood neighborhood late Tuesday. Upon arrival, they found medics providing treatment to Ferguson, who was unresponsive. “This is one of the darkest moments in our lives and we are still utterly shocked,” the statement read. “We ask that you please respect our privacy as we navigate through this difficult time.” The Ravens announced the 26-year-old’s death Wednesday in a statement on Twitter. Police said there were no signs of trauma or foul play, but are “not ruling out the possibility of an overdose” in the “questionable death” of Ferguson, according to TMZ. “It is with deep sadness that we acknowledge the unexpected passing of our beloved Jaylon Ferguson,” the statement began. “Jaylon was a loving father, son, brother, fiancé and an exceptional athlete. “His kindness, big heart and infectious personality will be missed by so many, but his legacy will continue. We wholeheartedly appreciate the calls, texts and post of support from his many friends and fans upon learning of this tragedy.” Ferguson’s fiancée tweeted, “God, this is killing me baby!!! Rest In Paradise my King!!! I miss you like crazy.” The NFL community, including Ferguson’s Ravens teammates, shared their condolences on social media after the news about his death. Ferguson shared three young children with Smith.
