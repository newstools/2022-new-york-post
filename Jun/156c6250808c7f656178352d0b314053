As the Mets await news on another potential hit to the pitching staff, the lineup is about to be whole again. Catcher James McCann is expected to join the Mets in Miami and be activated in time for Friday’s start of a weekend series against the Marlins, sources told The Post’s Mike Puma. McCann last played in the big leagues May 10, before he underwent surgery to repair a broken bone in his left wrist. He is hitting .196 with a .266 on-base percentage and one home run in 56 at-bats this season. He spent most of this week on a rehab assignment at Double-A Binghamton, where he caught Max Scherzer’s rehab start. In place of McCann, the Mets have been using catchers Tomas Nido and Patrick Mazeika, who are hitting .219 and .167, respectively. Scherzer is nearing his return just as the Mets await word on Carlos Carrasco’s status. Carrasco left Wednesday’s start with back tightness but downplayed the potential severity heading into Thursday’s off day. The Mets already are without starters Jacob deGrom and Tyler Megill in addition to Scherzer. The Mets also reinstated reliever Seth Lugo (3.81 ERA in 28 ¹/₃ innings) from the paternity list. He was away from the team since Monday. In the corresponding move, reliever Yoan Lopez (4.05 ERA in 6 ²/₃ innings) was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse.
