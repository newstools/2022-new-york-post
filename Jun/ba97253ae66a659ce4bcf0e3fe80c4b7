Kathryne Padgett is reminiscing about the “trip of a lifetime” with beau Alex Rodriguez. In a video shared Tuesday on Instagram, the Dallas-based fitness competitor, 25, gave fans a glimpse at her lavish European vacation with the former Yankees slugger, 46, whom she was seen kissing during a night out. “Europe, you’re a keeper,” Padgett captioned the clip. “Had the trip of a lifetime aboard the @samurai_yacht with the most incredible people & blessed to have experienced the beautiful Amalfi Coast.” The video, which is set to Jay-Z’s “Interlude,” features Rodriguez and company soaking up the sun aboard the yacht and taking part in water sports. Padgett, who was first linked to Rodriguez in January, has been documenting her travels — and workout regimen — on social media in recent weeks, including a stop in St. Tropez. In a post shared Saturday on Instagram, Padgett is seen wearing a mini dress as she checks out the sites. Though it’s unclear if Rodriguez played “cameraman” for Padgett, he did drop a trio of “fire” emojis in response to his gal pal’s post. Rodriguez and Padgett have been stepping out frequently over the past few months, with the twosome making courtside appearances at NBA games. Recently, the couple was photographed leaving a nightclub in Ibiza, Spain, in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Rodriguez was previously engaged to Jennifer Lopez, with the pair calling it quits in March 2021. She got re-engaged to former fiancé Ben Affleck this past April.
