Bret Easton Ellis published his first novel, “Less Than Zero,” when he was 21 — earning him admission into the 1980s literary brat pack, with fellow members Jay McInerney, Tama Janowitz, Jill Eisenstadt and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Donna Tartt. Now, Ellis’s East Village/Union Square digs, where he wrote “American Psycho,” are on the market for $1.5 million. The 950-square-foot apartment is at 114 E. 13th St., otherwise known as the American Felt Building. The open layout home boasts high ceilings and a 400-square-foot terrace. “I threw a lot of parties in that apartment,” Ellis — who now lives on the West Coast — once told the Observer. “I had like 500 people there. I wanted that ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ party vibe, where everyone is just smashed into each other.” The building was once home to the former supplier of hammer felt for the Steinway piano company. The listing broker is Miles Chapin, of Brown Harris Stevens. Chapin’s great grandfather, William Steinway, married Elizabeth Ranft, the daughter of the owner of the American Felt Company, in 1890. The building boasts a common roof deck.
