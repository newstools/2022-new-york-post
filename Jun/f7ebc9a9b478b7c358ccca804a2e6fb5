It seems Dyson Daniels’ mom is still processing her whirlwind of a night at the 2022 NBA Draft last Thursday. Brikitta Kool-Daniels, the mother of the Pelicans’ first-round pick, became one of the draft’s breakout stars after she graced the stage at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn with her family while wearing a white dress with a slit. The moment captivated the internet’s attention, which Brikitta seemed to address Monday on Instagram. “Mayhem over a little white dress,” Brikitta captioned the post, which not only featured the dress in question but a collection of snapshots from her son’s big night. Daniels, a 19-year-old small forward, was selected by New Orleans eighth overall. He had previously been part of the NBA G League Ignite. Once Daniels’ NBA future was decided, Brikitta took to social media to celebrate, sharing snippets from the family’s time in New York. “Love and Appreciation for the people and team that made our draft experience a lifetime memory,” Brikitta gushed Saturday on Instagram. A day later, Brikitta shared a sweet tribute to Daniels, writing, “This moment for you son. Hard work starts again, but for now, soak it all in.”
