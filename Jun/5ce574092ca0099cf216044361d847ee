Every draftee gets compared to an NBA talent on draft night. Kendrick Perkins is gaining infamy for taking those comparisons to the next level. The ESPN analyst found an example for nearly every pick in the first round of Thursday’s 2022 NBA Draft and Twitter let him know just how well he did… or didn’t do. Desmond Bane chimed in when Perkins compared Trevor Keels, whom the Knicks selected in the second round, to the Grizzlies forward. “Me n Trevor Keels got similar game???” Bane asked on Twitter. “Yeah have you watched yourself lately?! Stay humble youngin,” Perkins responded, to which Bane answered with two laughing emojis. “Mostly here for the Kendrick Perkins player comparisons, better than any stand-up set on Netflix,” Sports Illustrated’s Kevin Sweeney wrote. Perkins notably misidentified A.J. Griffin as “the kid Jalen from Duke,” and dropped plenty of wild and unique comparisons. He has even recognized his own comedy, responding to a tweet about himself during the broadcast.
