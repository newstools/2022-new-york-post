The Dodgers are going to have to try to fend off the Padres and Giants in the NL West without ace Walker Buehler for at least a couple of months. The 27-year-old right-hander has been shut down for six-to-eight weeks because of a flexor strain in his right elbow. He will not throw during that period and will need to build back up once he’s cleared. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Saturday that “as of now” Buehler can pitch again this season and does not need surgery. Buehler, who underwent Tommy John surgery in 2015, left Friday’s start in San Francisco after allowing three runs in four innings with elbow discomfort. The two-time All-Star’s ERA ballooned from 2.91 to 4.02 over his last three starts. “When you lose one of the best pitchers in the game, it’s a big blow to anybody,” first baseman Freddie Freeman said. The Dodgers, who lost in the NLCS last year after winning the World Series in 2020, entered Sunday with a 37-22 record, a half-game up on the Padres for the division lead and 4.5 games up on the Giants. Los Angeles began the day with the second-best mark in the NL behind the Mets (39-22.) — With AP
