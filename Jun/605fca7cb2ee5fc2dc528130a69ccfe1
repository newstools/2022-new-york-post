Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told a British journalist to “go back to your country” after the scribe pushed her on America’s gun control debate during a heated back-and-forth on Second Amendment laws. The 48-year-old firebrand Republican, who’s known for espousing conspiracy theories and being a follower of Q-Anon, made the remarks during a press briefing on Wednesday after telling reporters it’s the job of elected officials to defend Americans’ right to possess guns. “We don’t have guns in the UK, that is true, but we don’t have mass shootings either,” the unidentified journalist shouted. “And our children aren’t scared to go to school.” Greene shot back: “You have mass stabbings, lady.” “You have all kinds of murder and you’ve got laws against that,” Greene continued. When the journalist noted the murder rates are lower in the UK, the rep told her to head back across the pond. “Well, you can go back to your country and worry about your no guns,” the controversial politician said. “We like ours here.” Greene later gloated about the moment on Twitter and posted a clip of the exchange. “When British press wants to argue about our God-given American gun rights, my answer is: ‘go back to your own country,’” she said. The identity of the journalist remains unclear.
