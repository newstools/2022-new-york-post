Cooper Kupp is staying put for the foreseeable future. The Rams wideout, who was the AP Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP, agreed to a new deal with the Rams, the team announced Wednesday. Kupp is now tied to Los Angeles for the next five seasons, at a total of $110 million, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. This comes the same week as the Rams gave superstar pass rusher Aaron Donald a $40 million raise and made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Kupp, 28, had two years left on his previous contract with the Rams and this week stressed finding a deal that would allow the team to stay competitive. “I really want this to be a collaboration that we work on,” Kupp said Tuesday. “That’s my goal. Something that’s great for the team, something that’s great for me and my family as well. That place exists, and it’s just getting there.” He signed a three-year extension to his rookie deal, worth about $47 million, prior to the 2020 NFL season, that would have had him signed through 2023. At about $16 million a year, Kupp was dramatically underpaid, at least relative to the new market at his position. This offseason, Davante Adams signed a deal with the Raiders worth $141 million over five years — $28 million annually — and Tyreek Hill got a four-year, $120 million deal with the Dolphins. Still a bit below those two in average annual salary, Kupp gave the Rams a little bit of a discount. It is clear he is happy with Sean McVay, Matthew Stafford and Co. and does not want to seek greener pastures.
