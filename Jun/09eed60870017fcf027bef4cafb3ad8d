Ronda Rousey left UFC six years ago but revealed there’s one headline fight that could reel her back into the octagon. Rousey, the first female inductee into the UFC Hall of Fame, expressed on a recent episode of “The Kurt Angle Show” that a face-off against Gina Carano would be worth putting on the gloves one more time. “I mean, I’ve said it a million times,” Rousey said. “It’s not like it’s something new but, for Gina man. Gina Carano, she’s the reason why I got into fighting, she’s the reason why I knew it was a possibility. I will always be forever grateful… and if she ever was like, ‘Ronda, I wanna fight you tomorrow at 205 pounds,’ like whatever the hell she’d want.” Rousey has had a couple of hyped stints with WWE following her departure from MMA. The 35-year-old currently reigns as the SmackDown Women’s Champion and will look to defend her title at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view on July 2. As for her proposed opponent, Carano hung up her gloves in 2009 after suffering a disheartening loss to Cris Cyborg. Carano, once considered the “face of women’s MMA,”  primarily fought in EliteXC and Strikeforce at a time when UFC did not have women’s matches. the 40-year-old has pursued an acting career in recent years, playing supporting roles in films such as “Fast & Furious 6” and “Deadpool.” She later played Cara Dune in Disney+’s hit series “The Mandalorian,” but was fired by Lucasfilm in 2021 after sharing controversial posts on Instagram. For now, the ball is in Carano’s court – all she has to do is name a time and a place. “If she wanted to come into my backyard and do the Rocky thing or, you know, ding, ding and we just do it in the backyard, I don’t care,” Rousey said. “I will fight Gina wherever she wants.”
