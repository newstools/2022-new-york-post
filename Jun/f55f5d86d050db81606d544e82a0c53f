The Beyhive is already buzzing like crazy. Beyoncé dropped the album cover for her seventh studio album, “Renaissance,” on Thursday. The 40-year-old mother of three is pictured sitting on top of a celestial, holographic horse with strategically placed materials covering her private parts. “act i RENAISSANCE 7.29,” she tweeted, to which fans went wild. “Creating this album allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world,” she captioned the stunning cover on Instagram. “It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving. My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration. I hope you find joy in this music. I hope it inspires you to release the wiggle. Ha! And to feel as unique, strong, and sexy as you are,” she concluded. One eagle-eyed fan on Twitter quickly noted that the cover seems to be inspired by a painting of noblewoman Lady Godiva from the Renaissance era. Another compared the artwork to Bianca Jagger arriving at Studio 54 on a horse — no surprise, given the house music and disco pastiche on her latest song and Vogue photo shoot. Other Yoncé enthusiasts were stunned that she even tweeted the announcement, considering the icon hasn’t posted on the platform since 2020. “BLUE IVY GAVE YOU THE PASSWORD,” one user joked about her Grammy-winning 10-year-old daughter. Fans quickly sold out the songstress’ four collectible box sets — called “poses” —  to go with the album last week. Each box included different variations of T-shirts, posters, collectible packaging and a CD. Last Friday, the “Get Me Bodied” singer released her first single off the new album, a dance song titled “Break My Soul.” “Renaissance” drops July 29.
