Paulina Gretzky is heating up Instagram while her new husband Dustin Johnson deals with the aftermath of ditching the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. The model took to her Instagram story on Wednesday to share a sultry bikini snap, modeling a blue two-piece and skirt by Devon Windsor. Gretzky, who rocked a pair of tinted black and white sunglasses in the photo, showed off her fit physique in the brand’s string Amelia Top, Addison bottoms and Alfie swim skirt. It’s unclear where the photo was snapped. However, it comes with Johnson part of the 48-man field for the LIV Golf league‘s first event on Thursday at Centurion Club outside of London. The former world No. 1 has faced criticism since he was announced to be in the field last Tuesday for the first of eight LIV Golf Invitational Series events. It was an about-face for Johnson, who said in February he was “fully committed” to the PGA Tour amid rumors he was being pursued by the rival league. The Saudi-backed league, which is fronted by Greg Norman, reportedly paid Johnson “around” $125 million to join their series. In a LIV Tour press conference on Tuesday, Johnson said his decision to make the switch was fueled by his family. “I chose what’s best for me and my family,” said Johnson, who tied the knot with Gretzky in Tennessee in April. The couple, who got engaged in 2013, has two sons — 7-year-old Tatum and River, 4.
