Albany pols passed a law Saturday requiring school districts statewide to seriously consider installing silent panic alarms to alert law-enforcement authorities during emergencies. The state Assembly approved “Alyssa’s Law,” named after 14-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff, who was shot and killed in 2018 during the Parkland, Florida school massacre. “Schools should be a safe place for our kids to learn and grow,” said Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie in a statement announcing the bill’s passage. Alyssa’s Law will force each school district’s safety teams to consider installing panic alarm systems and other direct communication technologies as part of their mandatory regular reviews of safety plans. The measure had previously passed in the state Senate and now heads to the governor’s desk to be signed into law. Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Mayor Eric Adams, said the city currently doesn’t believe it needs panic buttons in Big Apple schools but will review the measure. “Our children’s safety is our top priority, which is why all our public schools have School Safety Agents assigned to them,” Levy said in an email. “SAAs are members of the NYPD and, thus, our schools already have a direct line to police in case of an emergency. We don’t believe there is a need for legislation to supplement the good work we’re already doing in New York City public schools, but we will review this legislation.” Alhadeff’s family had been pushing for the bill’s passage in New York for three years. It already exists in Florida and New Jersey. Some schools in New York already use panic buttons.
