It was love at first sight! Justin McLeod, co-founder and CEO of the dating app Hinge, and his wife, Katherine, just plunked down $12.75 million for a four-bedroom spread in Chelsea, according to city property records. The 4,328-square-foot home comes with four bedrooms and 5½ baths — big enough to accommodate their growing family, a friend says, as the couple now share two children. The apartment was last asking $13.99 million. Common charges run $5,899 a month. McLeod founded Hinge for himself in 2011 while at Harvard Business School, trying to get over addiction and heartbreak. He eventually married his former heartbreak, and got over addiction. “I think a lot of times, success is born out of just a tremendous amount of failure,” he said in an interview with CNBC. “I’ve experienced that in my personal life, and I was able to bring that to Hinge.” The app has since been used by millions and was bought by Match Group, which owns other top apps like Tinder, for an undisclosed sum in 2019. The full-floor apartment was designed by Roman and Williams, whose clients include hotels, and celebs like Gwyneth Paltrow. It was developed by JDS Development. A keyed elevator opens straight into a great room with 11-foot ceilings, oversize casement windows and two twin loggias that are 176 square feet combined, while a set of French doors opens to a library. Another wing features a formal dining room and an eat-in chef’s kitchen, which comes with a butler’s pantry. The main bedroom suite is large, with two walk-in closets and a spa-like bath with a copper soaking tub, a steam shower, marble floors and walls. Building amenities include a gym with a yoga and Pilates room, a wine cellar with lockers for each unit and a landscaped rooftop with an outdoor kitchen, as well as an art studio and bike storage. The listing broker was Catherine Juracich while the buyers were repped by Juracich and Tom Ventura, both of Douglas Elliman.
