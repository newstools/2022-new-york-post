Before the Cleveland Guardians and Colorado Rockies open their series tonight, starting at 8:40 p.m. ET, Sean Zerillo of the Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The Guardians arrive in Denver in strong form, as they have won four of their last five games. Zerillo is interested in getting behind the Guardians, but not for the full game. Rather, he’s backing the Guardians F5 moneyline (-186 or better) with odds from BetMGM. The reasoning – the Guardians offense should have its way with Rockies starting pitcher Antonio Senzatela. “[Senzatela] ranks 11th out of 116 qualified starters…in strikeout minus walk rate,” Zerillo explains. “And the Guardians are impossible to strike out – nobody swings and misses less.” Additionally, the Guardians have the lowest strikeout rate in baseball. Add in that Coors Field features a ton of extra outfield room and Zerillo expects the Guardians will get balls in play and do damage offensively. On the flip-side, Guardians starting pitcher Shane Bieber has posted strong underlying metrics of late after a disappointing start to the season. Bieber’s ERA currently sits at 2.91 for the season with a 3.56 xERA and a 3.25 xFIP, making him – in Zerillo’s opinion – a trust-worthy pitcher in this spot. For all those reasons, take the Guardians at a slightly discounted price for the first five innings tonight in Colorado.
