If Marion Hawkins didn’t know it was her son who fell from a top-tier balcony at a Harry Styles concert, she would’ve thought it was a “blow-up doll.” The 39-year-old mother from Scotland is shocked — yet grateful — that her 20-year-old son, Dylan Wood, is “relatively unscathed” from his scary accident at the former boy bander’s Glasgow, Scotland, concert on Saturday. “I wish I hadn’t watched the video,” Hawkins admitted to The Sun about the fan-captured footage of the plummet. “You get a picture in your own head of what it looked like, but seeing that was terrible.” Hawkins was in bed when she got the dreaded call that Wood was injured and in the hospital. “He’s in high dependency (intensive care) because of his head and they have to keep an eye on him. He has a concussion and no breaks. He has two black eyes which I think is because maybe his face has been banged, his nose was bleeding and that’s it,” she said. “He has a sore shoulder but nothing is broken.” She said it was emotional to see her son on a ventilator for a day to stabilize him, but it is a “total miracle” that Wood is doing much better now. “We’re all just so relieved,” Hawkins shared, adding that he was “just really tired and upset” about the unusual — and alarming — incident. “I’ve went through Dylan’s whole life only going to the hospital twice for his asthma, and then he turned 20 and broke his kneecap and he needed a major operation,” his mother revealed. “And he still went to work and everything else,” she said about Wood, who is an electrical engineer. “He just gets on with it.” Despite Wood’s lack of prior health scares, Hawkins said he might’ve used his remaining luck on this incident. “I think he’s used up all his chips. All his lives are used up now, and mine as well,” she said. “He won’t be allowed to do anything where he can get a bruise or bump now.”
