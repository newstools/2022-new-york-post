It’s never a bad time to improve your skillset or learn the art of something new. After all, online classes (fun ones of your choosing, that is) can be taken year-round. Whether you want to embark on a sourdough bread-making journey or get the best beauty tips from none other than makeup legend Bobbi Brown, there’s one expert-taught platform that you can’t skip: MasterClass. For a limited time, MasterClass is offering up to 35% off an annual subscription, which will open the gates to all the wonderful, knowledge-gaining courses you can ask for. From understanding how to sauté and roast with Gordon Ramsay to improving your vocal range with Christina Aguilera, there’s never a dull moment on the platform. We’ve been using MasterClass for months and it’s 100% worth the grab. You can’t put a price on self-development (after all, it’s rather rewarding), so grab the annual membership before the sale ends. You can choose from three different MasterClass plans, though the best value is its family plan: six devices can benefit from learning MasterClass. This makes it especially useful for work groups and friends with similar (or different) interests. Plus, the courses are meaningful and well-thought-out. You may opt for a YouTube video on whatever your preference is, but you’re receiving a chronological overview of the topic of your choosing. Your online learning experience will be heightened with a great pair of protective blue light glasses, too. So, what are you waiting for? This is one of the best deals of the week (trust us, we do our research) and can’t wait for you to start learning. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
