A Bronx day care owner has been indicted on multiple charges for allegedly sexually assaulting a boy under his care, prosecutors said Monday. Silfredo Castillo Martinez, 32, owner of Lina’s Garden Day Care, which operated out of his home, has also been accused of possessing a collection of child pornography and he was first charged for that offense last month, authorities said. The NYPD and US Secret Service raided Martinez’s home day care, located on Decatur Street in Williamsbridge, and seized 30 devices on May 3, according to the Bronx District Attorney’s Office. The investigation found he allegedly downloaded 12 child pornography files in his Google Drive account, including images and videos of boys between the ages of seven and 12. One child was even as young as one, the district attorney’s office said. As the investigation moved forward, authorities found a photo and video of a child that was taken inside the day care, which prosecutors allege is the boy who was sexually abused by Martinez. “The defendant, a daycare owner, was supposed to keep children safe, instead he allegedly sexually assaulted a boy in his care,” Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said in a statement. “[Martinez’s] actions are despicable and sickening, and he cannot be caring for children in our community.” Martinez was arraigned Monday on a slew of charges, including two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child, two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act and and 12 counts of possessing a sexual performance by a child. Bail was set at $500,000, cash or bond, by Bronx Supreme Court Judge George Villegas and Martinez is due back in court Sept. 20. A call to the attorney representing Martinez, H. Benjamin Perez, listed by the district attorney’s office, was not returned Monday evening. The day care search website Winnie stated Lina’s Garden Day Care was closed.
