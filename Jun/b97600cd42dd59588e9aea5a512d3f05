Netflix star surgeon Dr. David Langer, whose day job is chair of neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital, and his wife, Dr. Nancy Lipsitz, have turned the spotlight on their own home, which is on the market for $4.35 million — down from its $4.75 million ask earlier last month. Langer is one of the stars of “Lenox Hill,” a 2020 docuseries on the streaming service that follows four doctors and their patients at the Upper East Side hospital. Lipsitz, an anesthesiologist, also appears briefly on the buzzy show. The Yorkville home has been a peaceful respite for the busy doctors, who are often in Central Park with their two goldendoodles on the weekend. The 20th-floor duplex inside the Chartwell House, at 1760 Second Ave., is 3,400 square feet, and comes with five bedrooms and 3½ baths. Details include art walls, a custom steel staircase, wood paneling and hidden storage. The duplex opens to a foyer that leads to a 42-foot-wide dining room. There’s also an eat-in chef’s kitchen and two upper-level main bedrooms separated by a media lounge, and two lower-level bedrooms. Building amenities include a residents’ lounge with a catering kitchen, a landscaped sun deck, a gym, a children’s playroom and bike storage. The listing broker is Frances Katzen of Douglas Elliman.
