Kathryne Padgett seems to be enjoying her Italian vacation with beau Alex Rodriguez. Taking to Instagram last week, Padgett — who is a Dallas-based fitness competitor — posted a pair of bikini snaps that caught Rodriguez’s attention, as the former Yankees slugger, 46, dropped a trio of “fire” emojis in the comments. Both Padgett, 25, and Rodriguez have been sharing snaps from their European getaway on social media, including a group shot posted Sunday on her Instagram page. Captioning the post, “Italian summer nights,” Padgett is seen sitting beside Rodriguez aboard a yacht with pals. The twosome also shared a kiss while partying in Capri over the weekend. First linked in January, Padgett accompanied Rodriguez to a Packers playoff game at Lambeau Field. Rodriguez, who split from fiancée Jennifer Lopez last year, has been spotted with Padgett on multiple occasions since their Green Bay outing. In fact, she’s sat courtside with Rodriguez throughout the NBA playoffs, even after the Timberwolves — a team he co-owns — were eliminated. Padgett recently joined Rodriguez for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics and wasn’t afraid to show some affection. “She’s definitely way more touchy than [he is],” a spy told Page Six. “She gets really close to his face while talking and smiling.”
