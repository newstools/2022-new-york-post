Steve Kerr, nine-time NBA champion, tried to drink it all in after his Warriors won the Finals on Thursday. Literally, too. “I’m not going to lie: I’m hungover right now,” the Golden State coach told reporters upon landing in San Francisco on Friday. “We had a great night last night. We had an incredible night, a late night.” It was unclear how much Kerr or the rest of his team had slept, or if they had. Kerr said the flight from Boston — where they won Game 6 for Kerr’s fourth ring as a coach, all with this core of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green — felt like a long one. “Felt like we just flew in from Europe,” he said with a smile. He didn’t want to divulge much about how the Warriors celebrated and how much was imbibed. Asked a favorite story from the night before, he flashed back to the immediate moments after the victory, when his team turned a vicious chant into a celebratory one. “When we got into the locker room and the whole team started chanting, ‘F U Draymond,’ mocking the Celtics fans,” Kerr said. “That was pretty funny.” The Warriors’ victory parade will come Monday, and the celebration probably won’t stop anytime soon. Thursday “was a beautiful night,” Kerr said.
