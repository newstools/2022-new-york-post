A livery cab driver was shot early Thursday — and drove back to his Bronx base gravely wounded, according to cops and police sources. The 60-year-old victim was blasted in the chest at an unspecified location — but made it back to the VIT Car Service base on White Plains Road near Archer Street in Van Nest, the sources said. Police were called to the base around 2 a.m., and the victim was rushed to Jacobi Medical Center, where he is listed in critical condition, authorities said. The circumstances leading up to the shooting — and information on a suspect — were not immediately known.
