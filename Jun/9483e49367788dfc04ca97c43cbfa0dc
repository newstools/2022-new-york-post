It’s like a “Where’s Waldo?” on speed. Social media user’s eyes are pinwheeling over this mind-blowing optical illusion in which puzzlers are challenged to find all six animals. The visual challenge was first published on the BhaviniOnline brain-teaser site earlier this month — but it is currently going viral as users wrack their brains trying to solve it: “Can you find the 6 animals hidden in the picture?” reads the description to this “I Spy” speed round. [Warning: Spoilers below]. Only 17% of people can locate all the camouflaged creatures — while one could potentially break the world record by finding all six in under six seconds, according to the Sun. On its face, the drawing is a standard landscape that features a smorgasbord of mountains, grassland, trees and various shrubbery. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the picture is hiding six critters. They include a gray camel camouflaged against the mountains, a crocodile on the left tree with bark for scales, a sepia-tone deer concealed against both a tree and grass, a literal snake in the grass, and a butterfly in the flower patch.

This sight safari isn’t the only animal-based illusion giving social media users agita. Puzzle-lovers have been left frustrated by another baffling brain teaser that challenges them to find the blue-eyed fox in record time. Meanwhile, apparently only the top 1% of people can find all the animals in this mind-bending illustration of a silhouetted bear.
