Simiso Buthelezi, a professional boxer from South Africa, is reportedly in a coma after appearing disoriented in his WBF African lightweight title fight against Siphesihle Mntungwa last weekend. “There’s no change in his condition, he’s in a coma, he’s not talking, moving or doing anything right now,” his trainer, Bheki Mngomezulu, said, via South African reporter Thabiso Mosia. “The doctors say there could be a blood clot on the brain due to a blow to the head,” said Mngomezulu, adding that Buthelezi’s family is devastated over his condition. “This is very tough to take, especially for his family. Simiso has just graduated two weeks ago at UniZulu in Zoology and Botany. The family can’t understand why this had to happen because Simiso has a bright future.” Fans on social media raised concern over video footage from the fight that showed Buthelezi — who was dominating in the bout — appear to forget his surroundings in the ring. A few seconds into the 10th and final round, Buthelezi knocked Mntungwa through the ropes and stumbled back to the center of the ring. Buthelezi then turned his back to his opponent and began punching in the direction of the referee, which confused broadcasters calling the fight. When Buthelezi began punching the air in a corner of the ring, the referee called off the fight, resulting in a victory for Mntungwa.
