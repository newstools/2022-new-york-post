If you feel better after a walk than a day of bed rest, you’re not alone. Your body might need to move, but sometimes you don’t have the energy to get it there. Whether you’re healing from an injury or just trying to stay ahead of those aches and pains that come sooner every year, a little motion in your day could be a big help. The Vitality Swing: Chi Swing Machine can help you get more physical activity out of your day without risking injury or strain, and for a limited time it’s on sale for only $249.99 (Reg. $350). The Vitality Swing uses a 40W motor to provide powerful wave-like motion for the legs and spine. It’s easy to use and comfortable to rest in. The padded vinyl ankle cradles will keep your legs supported and in place. There’s even a remote control so you don’t have to do a whole other workout routine whenever you want to switch the setting. The Vitality Swing can be used to stimulate muscle contraction, boost oxygen, and loosen the spine. That means if your muscles are feeling tight, you need to bump up that blood oxygen, or you want to help relax your spine, this could be a huge help. It can even help you stimulate your metabolism, an important part of losing weight, and you don’t even need to go outside. Machines like the Vitality Swing can be so helpful. One user writes “I use it for my mom who is 93 years old as she does not walk well. Good for myself as I play tennis and use it to relax my legs.” The problem is often how expensive these devices are. Often you can only find them for $300 or $350, and that’s just not possible for a lot of people who could use them, especially if you or your family member is on a fixed income. That’s why it’s so exciting that the Vitality Swing can do so much for your body without a sky-high price. For a limited time, you can get the Vitality Swing: Chi Swing Machine on sale for $249.99 (Reg. $350). Prices subject to change.
