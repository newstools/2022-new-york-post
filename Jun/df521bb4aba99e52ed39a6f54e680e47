Her love won’t be caged. An American tourist attempted to get Robert Irwin’s cellphone number Tuesday while she was visiting the Australian Zoo where the 18-year-old zookeeper works. The video — which now has over 2.2 million views on TikTok — shows Steve Irwin’s son laughing at the bold pickup line. “I think you are so cool and I was wondering if I can have your number,” the woman boldly said. “Well, I’m very flattered,” laughs Irwin. “The easiest way [to contact me] is on Instagram because then my people can monitor it and see when it comes through because my number is getting mixed.” The lady, who would not be dissuaded from getting Irwin’s digits, said that she had messaged him the previous night to let him know that she was coming, but he did not respond. “Well, I actually DM’d you last night to tell you I was coming here today,” she said. Several users were quick to comment on the foolhardy attempt. “Bro (in the most polite way) said ‘no,'” commented one user. “He’s trying to turn you down so politely. Just let it go,” said another. Other fans were quick to comment how sweet the youngest Irwin sibling was in the rejection. “Homeboy said no in the most gentlemanly way ,” a user crooned. “I don’t think he is saying no. he probably has so many people try to have access to him that he has precautions with his safety. he is so sweet,” one optimistic user said. It would not be the first time one of the Irwin children found love at their place of work. In 2013, Robert’s sister Bindi Irwin met Chandler Powell, who was touring the Sunshine Coast animal sanctuary, when they locked eyes. They are now married with one daughter.
