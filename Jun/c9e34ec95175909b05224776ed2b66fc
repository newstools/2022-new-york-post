A 20-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Manhattan subway train after accidentally falling onto the tracks on Tuesday night, police said. The woman somehow tumbled onto the roadbed at the Grand Central subway station as a southbound 7 train was approaching at about 10:40 p.m., according to the NYPD. The train’s operator tried to brake in time, but ended up striking the woman, cops said. First responders with the FDNY tried to save the woman, but she was pronounced dead about an hour later, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the victim to fall onto the tracks.
