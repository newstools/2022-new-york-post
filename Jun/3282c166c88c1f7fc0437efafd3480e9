Something’s going on in Utah, and it may not be beneficial to the Knicks’ cause. Quin Snyder, one of the league’s most successful and esteemed coaches, stepped down after an eight-year run and 372-264 record with the Jazz. Sentiment around the league is combo guard Donovan Mitchell somehow is involved in the shake-up, though ESPN reports Mitchell is “disappointed’’ and “unsettled.’’ The franchise is at a crossroads after a first-round KO versus Dallas in the playoffs. The Jazz are contemplating breaking up the Mitchell-Rudy Gobert tandem that’s been a solid playoff entrant but not potent enough to get to a Western Conference finals. The Knicks — and several other teams — are monitoring Mitchell’s situation to see if he asks for a trade. Snyder said in a release the Jazz need “a new voice.’’ According to a source, Knicks assistant coach Johnny Bryant, a former Jazz assistant and Mitchell pal, will likely interview. Utah president Danny Ainge doesn’t know Bryant, but if he’s strongly considered, then it’s a sign Mitchell is influencing matters despite being disappointed. According to sources, former Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts is the early favorite and recently fired Lakers coach Frank Vogel also could command a look. Reportedly, Celtics assistant Will Hardy will get an interview, too. Mitchell is a client of Creative Artists Agency so Knicks president Leon Rose, former CAA basketball chief, could have intel on where Mitchell’s head is. Mitchell, who is from Westchester, was noncommittal after the Jazz’s playoff ouster. League sources believe Mitchell eventually will request a trade, but it might not be until next summer. If Bryant leaves for Utah, that would mean all three of the assistants senior executive William Wesley hired for Tom Thibodeau’s staff will have bolted for head-coaching jobs. Mike Woodson (Indiana University) and Kenny Payne (Louisville) are already gone.
