J.D. Davis hits the ball harder than just about anybody in MLB. But that hasn’t translated into his traditional statistics. The Mets DH/infielder has a .260/.340/.374 slash line with two homers and 13 RBIs, which falls into the solid-but-unspectacular category. His Statcast numbers are more eye-catching. Included is Davis’ HardHit frequency, a whopping 63.9 percent, which ranks in the 100th percentile among major league players. Davis’ average exit velocity of 93.8 mph ranks in the 97th percentile. Those numbers, among others, suggest Davis should be batting .312 (expected batting average, or xBA) with a .568 slugging percentage (expected slugging percentage, or xSLG), statistics much higher than Davis has produced. This week, he spoke to Post Sports+ about these unlucky trends and how his season is going.
