A scary scene unfolded at Citi Field late in the Mets’ 2-0 loss to the Astros on Wednesday at Citi Field. Houston shortstop Jeremy Pena and left fielder Yordan Alvarez collided while tracking down a fly ball in the bottom of the eighth inning. Dom Smith skied a pop-up into short left field, with Pena and Alvarez giving chase. The infielder’s arm appeared to hit Alvarez in the face moments after he caught the ball, causing both to fall to the ground. Both players remained on the field while teammates and team personnel checked on them, before being removed from the scoreless game. Mauricio Dubon took over at short, while Chas McCormick substituted into left field. Pena and Alvarez are being evaluated for concussions, and the team will have an update on their conditions on Thursday, according to the Houston Chronicle.
