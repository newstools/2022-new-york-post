Miles Teller’s fictional Miami penthouse duplex just sold for $3.75 million. Teller — who is gaining new fans for his role in “Top Gun: Maverick,“ where Tom Cruise trains a new generation of pilots — also starred in “War Dogs” with Jonah Hill. In the “War Dogs” film, Teller and Hill play two arms dealers contracted by the US government to provide weapons to the Afghan army. Teller’s character lives in the penthouse, which is on the 55th floor of Marina Blue, at 888 Biscayne Blvd. The four bedroom, four bath unit is 4,498 square feet and features a corner living room that boasts 20-foot, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Biscayne Bay and downtown Miami’s skyline. There’s also three balconies, two living rooms, a dining room, an open chef’s kitchen and four parking spaces. It first went on the market for $5.49 million in 2016. The seller is Alain Berdouare — brother of Chicken Kitchen founder Christian de Berdouare — who bought it for $1.73 million in 2008, when the building first launched. Alain, who also sold a $10 million home on Florida’s Venetian Islands for $10 million in 2017, was repped by ONE Sotheby’s International Realty brokers Mirce Curkoski and Albert Justo, while the buyer was represented by Kevin Kavanaugh of Associates Realty. Alain’s brother Christian was in the news in 2020 for selling his Miami mansion, once owned by drug dealer Pablo Escobar, for $11 million. Last year he also sold a North Bay Road bone for $29.5 million, according to the Real Deal. Both brothers were also in the news for their vast array of offshore companies, exposed in the Panama Papers. Aeternus Trust Limited, the company controlling Chicken Kitchen International, was tied to 17 offshore companies, the Miami Herald reported in 2016.
