Drivers on a New Jersey interstate got a free firework show Sunday night when a tractor-trailer transporting a large amount of the fireworks caught fire — setting off an explosive display of colors into the night sky. The truck driver noticed the tire of a dolly he had on the truck was ablaze and pulled over to the side of I-287 South in Bridgewater at around 10:30 p.m., New Jersey State Police said. The fire quickly spread and ignited some of the thousands of pounds of fireworks loaded onto the trailer. Drivers and passengers stuck behind the truck — near Exit 14A — filmed videos of the exploding fireworks as they waited for the traffic to clear. The wild scene backed up traffic for hours as several lanes were shut down as authorities responded to the tractor-trailer fire. The fire was brought under control and no one was injured, police said.
