The father of a young murder victim went ballistic in an Ohio courtroom and relentlessly sucker-punched the man accused of killing his toddler son. Desean Brown, 22, faces murder charges after he allegedly stabbed 29-year-old Nyteisha Lattimore to death and allegedly tossed her three-old-son Nylo into the Ohio River while he was still alive, according to reports. If convicted, he could face the death penalty, but the boy’s biological father, Antonio Hughes, couldn’t wait to serve out some of his own justice. In courtroom footage obtained by Fox 19, Hughes can be seen in the back row of the Hamilton County courtroom before sneaking up to the defense table from behind and slugging Brown in the jaw with a right hook. He kept pounding Brown as two sheriff deputies rushed to restrain the aggrieved father and tackle him to the floor. In another video from WCPO 9, even after he was handcuffed and surrounded by three deputies, Hughes continued his pursuit of the alleged killer by lunging toward him. Ultimately it took four officers to wrestle him down to the ground again, the video shows. Hughes was hit with a contempt of court charge and will be jailed for seven days, WCPO 9 reported. Brown is accused of stabbing Lattimore in December 2020 after he planned her murder for months, investigators said, according to the Cincinnati Inquirer. After he killed her, he then allegedly waited several days before putting her in a body bag and having an Uber drive him to the Ohio River. He told the driver the bag was just clothes. Lattimore’s body was found near the Purple People Bridge on Dec. 12, 2020, the newspaper reported. Detectives said Nylo’s blood was found on a Paw Patrol blanket with his mother’s body and a stroller was found nearby, the Cincinnati Inquirer reported. Cincinnati police detectives told a judge earlier this month Brown killed Lattimore because she had a miscarriage of a baby he thought was his, WCPO 9 reported. Nylo’s body has not been recovered.
