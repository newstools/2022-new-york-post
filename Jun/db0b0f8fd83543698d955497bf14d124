An optical illusion has got people’s minds spinning after being revealed on TikTok. Almost 6,000 people commented on the viral video – and no one really knows the truth behind it. It shows a figure going through a weird looped hole continuously. But do you see the person falling or climbing? That’s the killer question asked by TikTok user Lookmm178. Apparently, only seven percent of people see the person climbing through the hole. Meanwhile, the remaining 93 percent see them falling through it. But users in the comments are divided. Some say they can actually see both a fall and a climb movement. “I saw him climbing up then falling a lil bit,” one user said. “We know it goes down then up,” another added. Others weren’t so sure. “I see him crawling down,” a third person commented. What do you see? This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
