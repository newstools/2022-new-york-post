The D.C. bar leveled ethics charges Friday against Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump’s attorney, over baseless claims he made in a federal court alleging that the 2020 presidential election was mired in fraud. The case, which is brought by the D.C. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, is based on the former New York City mayor’s efforts to push forward the voter fraud accusations in a Pennsylvania court, according to a report. The charges came a day after the US House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack against the US Capitol began prime time hearings in which it brought forth evidence that Trump and some of his political allies sought to overturn the results of the 2020 poll.
