A woman walking with her pit bulls was seriously injured in the Bronx in a hit-and-run that killed one of the beloved dogs, police said Wednesday. An Audi SUV struck 55-year-old Tanyi Mejia as she was crossing the Grand Concourse at the intersection of Mosholu Parkway just after 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to police and sources. Mejia was rushed to St. Barnabas Hospital, where a family member told The Post she had a slight concussion. “She’s conscious from what I know… they’re just monitoring her because she had like a slight concussion,” her stepson, George Alvia, said. The family didn’t have the heart at first to even tell Mejia that one of her pit bulls had died. “[My dad] didn’t tell her because he didn’t want her to panic or anything like that,” he said.
