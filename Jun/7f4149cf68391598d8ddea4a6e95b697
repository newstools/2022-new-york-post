The two teenage brothers who drowned in a school pool in New Jersey have been identified by local officials. Jack Jiang, 16, who attended Bayonne High School, and 19-year-old Chu Ming Zheng, a recent graduate, were swimming in the deep end of a pool at the Lincoln Community School during public swimming hours when lifeguards noticed they were in distress around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, WABC reported Lifeguards pulled the brothers out of the water and called 911. First responders tried to revive the pair before they were taken Bayonne Medical Center and pronounced dead. “Our hearts and prayers go out to the family and to all of our community,” Bayonne Superintendent John Niesz told WABC. The district said counselors will be available to students and staff. The pool, which is in a primary school, is open to the public during night hours. “It shouldn’t happen,” neighbor Luann Beatrice told WACB. “It’s not like they were 2 and 3. They were 16 and 19, right? They swam, and there’s supposed to be a lifeguard.” The Bayonne Police Department, the Bayonne School District, the school insurance provider and OSHA are each conducting independent investigations into the drownings. The pool remained closed for investigation as of Friday. The Bayonne School District has organized a fundraiser on behalf of the brothers’ family. The district will be collecting gift card donations at Korpi Ice Rink over the weekend.
