That’s why we are so incredibly honored to introduce the night’s first nominee for best musical, ‘MJ,’ which, using many of his iconic hits, looks at the complexities and brilliance of our father’s process.” “MJ: The Musical” shows Jackson’s life during his “Dangerous” tour has been nominated for 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical and Actor. Paris Jackson recently revealed that King of Pop instilled a s strong work ethic and eclectic music taste in his kids. “My dad was really good about making sure we were cultured, making sure we were educated, and not just showing us like the glitz and glam, like hotel hopping, five-star places,” Jackson said in an interview. “Growing up, it was about earning stuff. If we wanted five toys from FAO Schwarz or Toys R Us, we had to read five books,” she said.” “It’s earning it, not just being entitled to certain things or thinking, ‘Oh, I got this.’ It’s like working for it, working hard for it — it’s, it’s something else entirely. It’s an accomplishment.”
