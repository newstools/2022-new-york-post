Mark Jones’ commentary during Game 1 of the 2022 NBA Finals between the Warriors and Celtics had some NBA fans scratching their head. In Thursday’s series opener, the Celtics outscored the Warriors, 40-16, in the fourth quarter, including a 14-0 run that spurred Jones’ commentary. “The Celtics have stormed ahead! This insurrection has them leading by 11,” Jones said on the ABC/ESPN broadcast. Boston sealed a 1-0 lead with a 120-103 win, but Jones’ choice of words gave fans something “pretty weird” to talk about on Twitter. One fan tweeted that it’s “still too soon to drop an ‘insurrection’ during a broadcast, Mark Jones.” Some fans claimed Jones’ commentary was reminiscent of the January 2021 attacks on the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. Jones called the game with Mark Jackson in a two-man booth. He filled in for Mike Breen, ESPN’s lead NBA play-by-player, to call Game 1, after Breen was out with COVID-19 — as was ESPN game analyst Jeff Van Gundy and insider Adrian Wojnarowski. Jones also filled in for Breen on Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals after Breen tested positive for COVID-19. Game 2 is Sunday at Golden State. Breen, as well as Van Gundy, are possibilities to return for that matchup.
