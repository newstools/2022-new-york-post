Regan Gibbs-Marek, a former soccer player at the University of Kansas, was found dead in her apartment on Monday, and her husband has been charged with the murder. Gibbs-Marek, 25, married Chad Marek, 26, last fall. Fox 4 in Kansas City reports that Marek called 911 and confessed to killing his wife. “He told us that God told him to do it,” Lawrence Police Chief Rich Lockhart told the outlet. Police are investigating Marek’s mental health. “There obviously are some preliminary indicators that this person wasn’t mentally stable. We call it being in psychosis, so obviously that is something we will be investigating as well as this case continues,” Lockhart said. Jayhawks soccer coach Mark Francis and athletics director Travis Goff both offered condolences. “Our soccer program is heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of Regan,” Francis said in a statement. “She was a tremendous teammate and young woman, and touched so many during her time at Kansas. Regan will always be remembered for the impact she had both on and off the field. We share our condolences to her family, friends and teammates during this difficult time.” Added Goff: “We are devastated to hear about the loss of former KU student-athlete Regan Gibbs. Our KU family sends our love, support and prayers to Regan’s family, friends and former teammates as we all mourn her loss.” A GoFundMe created in Gibbs-Marek’s memory described her as a devout Christian who planned to return to school to become a physician’s assistant to do missionary work. “Regan had a precious soul and she was loved by everyone who knew her. She is leaving behind her mom and four younger sisters who are heartbroken by this tragic loss,” organizers wrote on the fundraising site. As of Wednesday afternoon, the GoFundMe has raised over $14,000.
