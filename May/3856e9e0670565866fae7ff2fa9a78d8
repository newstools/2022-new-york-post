Wedding bells will soon be ringing for NBA Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love, 33, and Sports Illustrated cover model Kate Bock, 34, who are getting married in NYC this summer after announcing their engagement on social media last year. Although they plan on being Out East for August, according to friends, they’ve rented their Amagansett beach house through June and July for $240,000. The happy couple spent part of lockdown in the Hamptons, where they added a home gym (sweating through workouts together) and walked from Atlantic Beach to Indian Wells with their darling Vizsla dog, Vestry, according to Hamptons magazine. The seven-bedroom, 6,100-square-foot home sits on just over an acre. Designed by Adam Jordan Architecture and built by John Hummel and Associates, the smart-wired modern home features an oversized chef’s kitchen with glass walls that open to the outdoor space, which boasts a fireplace and saltwater pool. The first floor comes with a junior suite and a home office, while the upstairs offers a primary suite, additional bedrooms and two decks. The clutch couple also has homes in Tribeca and Cleveland, Ohio. Listing brokerage Hedgerow Exclusive Properties declined comment.
