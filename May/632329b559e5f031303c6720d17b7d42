A man who was killed at a Dave & Buster’s in Times Square was stabbed in an area where players redeem tickets for prizes, police said Sunday. The two men began fighting around 10:40 p.m. at the restaurant at 234 West 42nd Street before the 42-year-old stabbed the 39-year-old victim in the chest. “They were in the prize redemption area and they got into a verbal dispute,” a police source said. “This is based on a security video.” “He stabs the victim in the chest and then takes off,” the source said. The attacker, who had a tattoo on his face, fled but was arrested after a restaurant employee described him to police “and one of the Times Square [NYPD] details stopped a guy fitting the description,” police sources said. The victim was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Luke’s Hospital.  His identity was pending family notification. No weapons were found on the suspect during the arrest, cops said. He has three prior unsealed arrests for gang assault and drugs, a police source said. The last one was two decades ago. Charges against him in the killing were pending, cops said.
