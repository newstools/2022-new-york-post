Sports Illustrated Swimsuit alum Haley Kalil has found a unique way to shake off online haters. In a post shared Thursday on Instagram, the 29-year-old model is first seen on the beach rocking a cheeky bikini and a crop top as a voiceover states, “She photoshops all her pictures.” Moments later, the photo of Kalil transitions into a real-time video, as she appears to pose for the camera before flashing a playful grin. “Haters gonna hate,” Kalil captioned the post. Though it’s unclear when the “she photoshops all her pictures” comment surfaced, Kalil —who is the estranged wife of former NFL player Matt Kalil — was lauded for Thursday’s post by her followers, who told the model to brush off the unwanted chatter. “Haters gonna be so mad after this,” one fan commented, while another remarked, “Yup. Don’t even bother responding to that mess. Keep killing it.” Kalil has recently been spending time in Mexico, where she has shared photos of herself soaking up the sun and enjoying some R&R. Earlier this month, Kalil filed for divorce from her husband Matt, whom she married in 2015. The two separated earlier this year, according to TMZ, with Kalil citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split. Matt, a former first-round pick for the Vikings in 2012, last played for the Texans in 2019. He was released, however, in September of that year.
