Another day, another viral moment from Paige Spiranac. On Sunday, the “Playing A Round” podcast host tweeted a photo of herself posing beside her mom in honor of Mother’s Day. The snap naturally took off on Twitter, with fans swooning over the mother-daughter duo. “WOW! Paige, you didn’t tell me you have a twin sister,” one fan tweeted, while another remarked, “You two look so much alike. Happy Mother’s Day Mrs. S.” As of Monday, Spiranac’s post has been “liked” nearly 17,000 times. In addition to celebrating her mom on Sunday, Spiranac also tipped her hat to golfer Max Homa, who won the Wells Fargo Championship this past weekend. “Love when Max Homa wins. It’s great for golf. He proves you can be active on social media and still get it done on the course,” she tweeted. Spiranac, a former golf pro, has a massive social media audience herself. With over 3 million Instagram followers and counting, the 29-year-old regularly shares videos and photos of herself on the course, and, most recently, her Augusta-inspired product launch. Ahead of the Masters last month, Spiranac dropped her sexy Augustan Beauty towel, which featured a photo of the golfer-turned-influencer lying in a bed of pink flower petals. The towels were warmly received by fans, many of whom responded with “fire” emojis to express their excitement. And while next year’s tournament is still a ways away, some fans are already pitching towel ideas for Spiranac’s third edition.
