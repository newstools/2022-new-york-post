Another lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct has been filed against Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson, according to ESPN. That brings the total to 23 in all. According to the report, the plaintiff changed her mind about filing the civil suit after watching the HBO “Real Sports” segment in which two of Watson’s accusers, Ashley Solis and Kyla Hayes, came forward and spoke with Soledad O’Brien about the alleged incidents. The two massage therapists talked about their alleged experiences with Watson in detail, with Solis saying Watson deliberately grabbed himself and “put his penis on my hand,” while Hayes said Watson kept intentionally touching her with his penis as she was trying to massage him. Meanwhile, Watson, who won’t face criminal charges after a grand jury in Houston didn’t find enough evidence to charge him on the nine counts he faced, continues to await word on what discipline — if any — he’ll receive from the NFL in the wake of the pending civil cases. In March, the Texans traded the former first-round draft pick to the Browns, with the 26-year-old inking a five-year, fully-guaranteed contract for $230 million. Until the league decides what action it will take against the quarterback, Watson is able to continue to practice and play, though it is expected that he will be suspended for some length of time before the season starts this fall.
