There was no Chris Rock joke preceding this slap. Just a fantasy football league gone wrong. Reds outfielder Tommy Pham slapped Giants outfielder Joc Pederson prior to the team’s game Friday night, according to The Athletic. The altercation occured in the outfield prior to the series-opener at Great American Ball Park. It was not related to anything on the field. Instead, it was the result of a text exchange between the two in a fantasy football group chat that includes players from multiple teams, according to the report. The pair quickly were separated. Pham was scratched from the lineup just before the game. “We’re investigating it and learning as much as we can about the incident,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said, prior to the game. “We’re taking it very seriously. Until we have a clear understanding of what happened, not willing to discuss it.” “Again, still looking into it,” Kapler said. “Taking it very seriously and learning as much as I and we can as quickly as we can. Not yet prepared to discuss it.” — With AP
