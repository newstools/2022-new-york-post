One of the two people killed in a Chicago mass shooting has been identified as a father of two with twins on the way, according to reports. Antonio Wade, 30, was among nine people who were shot outside of a Mcdonald’s Thursday night after an apparent argument with a woman escalated to gunfire, according to family members. Wade and another victim died, while the other seven victims survived. “My kids are 2 and 3 years old, and he built this bond with my kids,” Wade’s grieving girlfriend Enyrah Murry told ABC 7. “Like, whenever he wouldn’t be here, my daughter still wakes up and looks for him all around the house. What am I supposed to do now?” Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown told reporters earlier on Friday that a “personal conflict” sparked the shooting in the 800 block of North State Street around 10:45 p.m., blocks away from the Magnificent Mile and Loyola University’s Water Tower campus. A family member leaving balloons at the scene said that Wade had “two kids on the way who’s not going to know their dad because somebody took that from them,” the outlet reported The lone gunman, who has not yet been identified, was arrested while he tried to flee the scene, Brown said. It’s unclear what exactly sparked the shooting, but Murry said the scuffle began when Wade said something to a woman he knew from hanging out in front of the restaurant. “He exchanged words with a female and they had an altercation,” she said. “Then, she went and got males and they came back.” Five gunshot victims and one burn victim were taken to local hospitals following the shooting, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing a fire department spokesman. Crowds of people fleeing the scene spilled onto the nearby Red Line subway as cops searched for a suspect and a gun, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
