That’s cold. Three-time grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka has crashed out of the French Open in the first round after a four-set loss to French wildcard Corentin Moutet. The loss saw Wawrinka vent his anger over the temperature of the water. The 37-year-old former world No. 3 was far from his best as Moutet claimed a 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 victory to set up a match against 13-time champion Rafael Nadal. The 2015 French Open champion Wawrinka, who is on the mend from a foot injury which cost him most of last season, was playing in just his fifth top-level match of the year. A frustrated Wawrinka erupted over the temperature of his water while down 5-2 in the third set. “It is not normal at a grand slam,” Wawrinka raged at the umpire. “Is that normal? Do you think it is normal? So you call someone. It has been three changeovers, I asked you for some water that is not freaking freezing. “Because it is not good. You are at the French Open and you cannot get normal water. You think it is normal?” The blowup raised some eyebrows on social media. The Tennis Podcast tweeted: “Stan Wawrinka is complaining that the water is too cold, which is a new one on me.” Tennis author Mark “Scoop” Malinowski added: “Whining about water temperature is absurd especially by a great champion like Wawrinka. He’s gotta be tougher or just bring his own drink.” Wawrinka was frustrated during and after the result, telling media that his performance was indicative of his current level. “I started well and it was a good first set but unfortunately it was disappointing to lose,” Wawrinka said. “Unfortunately this is the reality of how I play at the moment. I need training, a lot of work. I am playing well but not at the level for matches like that. This is the reality unfortunately of where I am.”
