A thief knocked a 24-year-old mom and her 4-year-old son to the ground as he snatched a pricey chain off the woman’s neck in the Bronx, disturbing new video shows. The mother and son were walking on Grand Concourse near East 181st Street in Fordham Heights around 5:20 p.m. May 4 when the suspect approached them from behind, cops said. Video released early Friday shows the brute rushing up to the victim and yanking her by the hair — knocking her to the ground and causing her child to fall as well. He grabbed the woman’s chain — worth $6,500 — from her neck before running back down the block and taking off on a green moped, authorities said. The mother and son refused medical attention for minor scratches on their hands and knees, cops said. Police are still looking for the suspect, described as a man with a dark complexion, 18 to 25 years old, around 5 feet 6, with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a black ski mask, white T-shirt, blue jeans, black T-shirt and black sneakers.
