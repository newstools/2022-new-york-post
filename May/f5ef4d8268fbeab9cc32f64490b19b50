An unnamed campaign adviser to President Joe Biden once said that white people are “incredibly racist,” according to a new book. The claim was included in “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” by New York Times reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin, according to Fox News Digital, which obtained an excerpt of the tome. The quote was attributed to an unidentified advisor, who reportedly made the statement while discussing the pick of Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate in 2020. “You know, white women are incredibly racist. As are white men,” the adviser said, the book reportedly read. “None of it was safe. It was a risky thing to do. But it was the safest of choices we had.” “This Will Not Pass” also revealed that Office of Public Engagement director and senior adviser Cedric Richmond once called Democratic “Squad” Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib “f—ing morons,” according to the report. Richmond had been preparing the White House for possible mutiny from the left wing of the Democratic party, and accused progressives of lacking political savvy and misreading the results of the election, the book reportedly said. Counselor to the President Steve Ricchetti reportedly echoed Richmond’s sentiment, saying the “problem with the left is they don’t understand that they lost,” after progressives criticized COVID-19 stimulus bills as unsubstantial. The White House did not confirm any of the quotes to the outlet. “We respect that there will be no shortage of books written about the administration containing a wide variety of claims,” a White House spokesperson reportedly said. “We don’t plan to engage in confirmations or denials when it comes to the specifics of those claims.”
