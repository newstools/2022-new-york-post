Can you spot the four corn husks hidden among the pineapples? This tricky seek-and-find puzzle will put you to the test. Cartoonist Gergely Dudas shared the brainteaser on his website, where he keeps followers updated with his latest creations. The artist, also known as Dudolf, hasn’t made the test easy — with the corn and pineapples the same color and with a similar pattern. The only distinguishing feature is the spiky green pineapple leaves. Do you have what it takes to find the four hidden husks? Dudolf’s pineapples are all different shapes and sizes which makes the brainteaser even more perplexing. And there are also a few little mice scurrying across the scene to distract the eye. If you are struggling try looking for smaller crosses and points without leaves overlapping pineapples. Still can’t find them? Scroll to the bottom for the answer. It comes after another playful brainteaser celebrating the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. It is the Queen’s Jubilee next month, with parties set to take place across the country. Queen Elizabeth II is the only British monarch in history to reach this milestone jubilee — and you can celebrate her long reign in the comfort of your own home with this tricky brainteaser from ICON Printing.
