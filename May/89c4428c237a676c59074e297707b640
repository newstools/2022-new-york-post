Liz Cambage has been accused by the former captain of Australia’s women’s national basketball team of telling opponents on team Nigeria to go back to their Third World country. Jenna O’Hea, who was captain of Team Australia during the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (which were played in 2021), appeared on ABC Sport in Australia as the WNBA kicked off its season over the weekend. O’Hea was asked if it was accurate that, in an incident between Australia and Nigeria during a pre-Olympics scrimmage, Cambage had “her feathers ruffled” and told Nigerian players to “go back to your Third World country,” igniting a brawl. “That is all one hundred percent correct,” O’Hea responded. After the incident, Cambage withdrew from the Olympics, citing mental health. Cambage, who recently joined the Los Angeles Sparks, issued an indirect response to O’Hea’s explosive allegations. “The truth will always come to light, and it ain’t even dawn yet,” Cambage tweeted on Sunday. Meanwhile, Andrew Bogut, the former NBA big man who hails from Australia and was previously critical of Cambage pulling out of the Olympics, said that what Cambage told Nigerian players was actually worse. “You’ve just got the PG version, there was much more than that — I’m just glad someone’s come out and said it,” Bogut told a radio station in Australia on Monday.
