Snowflakes are in the forecast. Netflix’s latest reality series sends a group of clueless 20-something spoiled brats into the wilderness. Called “Snowflake Mountain” and premiering June 22, the show takes 10 overindulged “kidults” who refuse to grow up, fail to do chores to help their families or roommates, freeload off their wealthy parents, and don’t work steady jobs. Among these pampered Gen Zers, there’s a wannabe influencer (of course); a vegan who loves admiring her own reflection in the mirror; a 22-year-old aspiring model; a 24-year-old who still lives at home with her parents, refuses to help around the house, and has been fired from every job; a 25-year-old British party girl who lives with her mom and dad and doesn’t work; a 23-year-old college dropout who dreams of being a pro wrestler; a 25-year-old self-proclaimed “Disney princess” who refuses to leave the home she shares with her parents, and an unemployed 26-year-old who spends $500 of his parents’ money per week on manicures and facials. According to the trailer, these entitled “snowflakes” can’t load a dishwasher, and their families have reached their breaking points. They get tricked by their families into going on a survival retreat in the great outdoors, sans Wi-Fi or running water, to compete for a cash prize. The 20-somethings get a much-needed crash course in adulthood, led by a former army combat engineer and Navy explosive ordinance disposal officer. “This is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me in my whole life,” one contestant whines in the trailer. Other contestants are shown loudly shouting, “F – – k my life!” “Snowflake Mountain” premieres June 22 on Netflix.
