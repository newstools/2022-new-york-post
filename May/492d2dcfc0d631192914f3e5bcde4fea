Sometimes, you have to take literally none of a game at face value. Toss it out. Don’t let it enter into your decision making. That’s essentially how we should treat Game 5 between the Golden State Warriors and the Memphis Grizzlies, who blew out Curry and Co. by 39 points. It was just a weird night of basketball, and it can’t be trusted or factored into analysis. A key star in this series so far has been Andrew Wiggins, who is playing great and consistent basketball, outside of the numbers from their blowout loss. You can count on him to return to form in Game 6, making his prop bets a great option tonight. The game will be at 10:00 p.m. ET on ESPN. Wiggins is coming off a five-point performance, which was his lowest scoring total of the entire season. It’s not like he had a poor outing – the Warriors were getting thrashed, so Wiggins played only 19 minutes before Golden State waved the proverbial white flag. We shouldn’t care about his numbers from this game. Prior to Game 5, Wiggins had scored at least 16 points in the other four games in this series, and in five of his last six. Wiggins is a consistent threat that has a higher effective field goal percentage in this series than Steph Curry. All of the peripherals show value in this over.  Throwing out the last game, Wiggins has six or more rebounds in three of four games this series, and seven out of nine playoff games. It’s almost as though this line is being set on the back of his 4.5 rebounds per game average during the regular season, while throwing out that he has consistently cleaned up on the glass during this postseason. Not only has he hit that over in three of the previous four games in this series, but he has rebound totals of 10, nine, and eight in those three games. He’s cleared it by a lot. Betting on him to return to form in a potential close-out game and to fill the stat sheet like he has all postseason makes too much sense not to bet.
