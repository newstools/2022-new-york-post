A second suspect was busted this week in connection to the broad-daylight murder of a man during a Bronx motorcycle sale, cops said. Joan Vasquez, 32, of the Bronx, was picked up late Wednesday afternoon and charged with murder, manslaughter, assault and criminal possession of a weapon in connection to the May 18 murder of 20-year-old Jefferson Hernandez, cops said. Hernandez, of Spring Valley, Rockland County, drove down to East 144th and Exterior streets in Mott Haven with three other men to buy a Kawasaki motorcycle they found on Facebook Marketplace, authorities said. He was blasted in the head around 3:40 p.m. and rushed to Lincoln Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, cops said. The trio who drove down with Hernandez — in a black Chevrolet Trailblazer with a U-Haul flatbed trailer attached – were unharmed. Cops announced earlier this week that another man was busted in connection to Hernandez’s murder. Manuel Reyes, 23, was arrested and charged with murder, manslaughter, assault and weapon possession, cops said. Cops initially said they were looking for a total of four people in connection to the slaying – but didn’t have information on any other suspects Thursday.
