A tattoo model has shared what happened when she got blue inking on her eyeballs, and the reality is grim. The woman, who goes by Amber Luke, was left temporarily blind, and even cried blue tears, an experience that made her swear off getting extreme body modifications. Per The Daily Star, the incident happened when the model was in her early twenties, about five years ago. Luke has spent upwards of $90,000 on body modifications through the years, getting various things done since the age of 14, and now has over 600 tattoos covering 98 percent of her body. Despite being covered head to toe with a variety of tattoos and various piercings, the social media star had never experienced anything quite like her eyeball tattoos. Apparently, the inking left her “completely incapable” of being independent. She even cried bright blue tears, an after effect of the tattoos. Since the incident, Luke has written a post on her Instagram in reflection: “It’s been five years since I lost my sight for three weeks and was completely incapable of being an independent person. “The torturous procedure had me endure four syringe injections into each of my eyeballs. “I cried blue tears for two days after the procedure was performed.” Trying to accurately portray the length of her struggles, Luke got a tattoo of a woman crying blue tears inked on her chest. And, in 2019, Luke told Barcroft TV: “I can’t even begin to describe to you what the feeling was like, the best thing I can give you is once the eyeball was penetrated with the ink, it felt like [the tattoo artist] grabbed 10 shards of glass and rubbed it in my eye. “That happened four times per eye, that was pretty brutal. “Unfortunately, my artist went too deep into my eyeball. “If your eyeball procedure’s done correctly, you’re not supposed to go blind at all. “I was blind for three weeks. That was pretty brutal.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
