A mom told how she smokes marijuana while her kids play – but says it is no different from other mothers drinking wine or even taking anxiety medication. Caitlin Fladager, 28, lives in Vancouver, Canada, where recreational and medicinal marijuana use is legal. The mom of two has now said in an Instagram post: “If you see a mum drinking wine while she watches her kids and it doesn’t bother you, or taking her anxiety medication, then this shouldn’t bother you either.” She then points at cannabis. In another video she says: “When another mum judges me for using weed while she pours her third glass of wine… wow you crazy, you crazy girl.” She wrote in relation to this: “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. This double standard has got to stop. “I constantly see shirts, posters, signs, mugs, etc that say “mommy needs a glass of wine.” Or “mom juice”. But the second a mother says she uses cannabis, it’s instant judgment a lot of time time. “I will forever share the benefits of this plant, and the amazing ways it can be used when done properly and with good intentions.” She says she wants to “raise awareness” of how marijuana can actually help up women become better moms to their children. Posting on Instagram, she previously said: “I have never been the most patient with my two kids. “Weed makes me a better mom, as I get a good night’s sleep after I smoke. I wake up well rested, and with a more clear mind.” Previously Caitlin said she only smokes weed once her kids are in bed⁣ but now she revealed she had a filter-style product that hid the smell of it from her kids.
