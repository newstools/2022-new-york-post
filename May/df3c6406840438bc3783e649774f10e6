With a completely straight face, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN viewers that Nina Jankowicz, the chief of his  new Disinformation Governance Board, is “absolutely” politically neutral. Right. And AOC is a Republican. Look, Jankowicz might be “a renowned expert in the field of disinformation,” as Mayorkas protested when asked about complaints of her obvious bias, but that’s only because the whole academic “field” is a left-leaning crock. In fact, she’s a veteran disinfo spreader — from promoting the bogus Trump-Russia dossier to waging war on The Post’s 100% accurate reporting off Hunter Biden’s laptop. She was sure she was right, but that’s the problem: Like too many others, she’s lost all critical perspective. Democrats and progressives have rushed far left without realizing how few other Americans have joined them, as illustrated by the cartoon Elon Musk famously posted to Twitter last week. Worse, they then denounce those who haven’t gone along as extremists, racists, etc. It’s the pot calling the sugar bowl black. The left, and all too many establishment liberals who’ve tried to keep up, no longer has any understanding of what the word “neutral” actually means.
