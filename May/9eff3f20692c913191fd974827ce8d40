Poof! Magic is back for at least one night. Magic Johnson, who was announced as part of ESPN’s “NBA Countdown” before the season began, will now appear at Game 1 of the NBA Finals when the Warriors host the Celtics on Thursday night. Johnson relayed the news via tweet on Monday. It will be Johnson’s second appearance of the season on the show. While Johnson didn’t mention it in his tweet, a source said the Lakers great is also expected to be a part of an alternate broadcast for Game 1 in which the 75 years of the league will be celebrated. Johnson appeared on “Countdown” in March, his one and only other time before Thursday. Last week, The Post wrote about his vanishing act, quoting Dave Roberts, ESPN’s head of NBA and studio production, in a statement. “There have been unexpected scheduling conflicts as Magic continues to expand his business commitments,” Roberts said. “While our new ‘NBA Countdown’ team has been exceptional this season, we have a great relationship with Magic and the door is always open to work together.” Since the story ran, the two sides figured out a way to have Johnson for Game 1 of the Finals.
