Bradley Cooper was criticized for wearing a fake nose to portray legendary conductor Leonard Bernstein in his upcoming Netflix film “Maestro”. The Oscar nominee was described as “unrecognizable” while wearing a prosthetic nose in a trailer for the Netflix biopic that was released on Monday. “Who the f–k made the conscious decision to say ‘oh yes, we’ll put a prosthetic nose on a non-jewish man to play a jewish person, brilliant idea, definitely not anti-semitic or a damaging stereotype in any way,” one user wrote on Twitter. Chief Television Critic for The Hollywood Reporter Daniel Fienberg called the actor’s latex-heavy look “problematic” in a post on social media. “My question, ‘How many pounds of latex would it take to make Bradley Cooper into an elderly Jewish man?’ was supposed to be rhetorical,” Fienberg wrote. Another Twitter user wondered, “Or you could…hire an old Jewish actor…instead of slapping on a prosthetic nose? this some antisemitic bulls–t that he’ll win an Oscar for.” Bernstein, who was born to Russian Jewish immigrants, is best known for his work on “West Side Story.” “Maestro” follows Bernstein’s life up until his death at 72 years old in 1990 when the conductor died from a heart attack caused by progressive lung failure. Fienberg also called out the movie creators for their choice in casting Carey Mulligan as Bernstein’s first wife, saying: “My critiquing of Bradley Cooper converting to Latex Judaism caused me to fail to even notice Carey Mulligan as Leonard Bernstein’s first wife, who was Chilean-Jewish. That’s a LOT of ethnic cosplay for one movie.” The “A Star is Born” actor is also directing “Maestro,” with its release expected to be sometime in 2023, according to Deadline. Cooper’s publicist and Netflix did not immediately return a request for comment from The Post.
