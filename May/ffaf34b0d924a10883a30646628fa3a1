The Dutch tourist who was tragically killed while trying to perform a daring cliff stunt in front of his horrified wife and two kids has been identified as a former European footballer. Mourad Lamrabatte, a 31-year-old who played for SBV Vitesse, attempted to leap feet first from a high cliff in Majoraca, but failed to clear the rocks beneath him while making a 100-foot plunge near a holiday resort Thursday, The Sun reported. The deadly leap was filmed by his heartbroken widow. As he jumped, Lamrabatte belted out a massive scream — but didn’t have enough momentum to clear the razor-sharp rocks below. He then smashed into them, and his wife could be heard screaming: “Oh my God.” Police had yet to question her about the tragedy because she was still in a state of shock, according to The Sun. An autopsy found Lamrabatte drowned in a state of semi-consciousness rather than dying from impact injuries. His former team, SBV Vitesse, one of the oldest pro soccer clubs in the top Dutch league known as the Eredivisie, offered condolences. “Vitesse wishes Mourad’s family and friends a lot of strength in coping with their great loss,” said a team spokesman.
