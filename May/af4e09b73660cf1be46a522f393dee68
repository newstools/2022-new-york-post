Broadway just got turned upside down. Gaten Matarazzo, 19, who is known for his role as Dustin Henderson in the Netflix thriller series “Stranger Things,” announced Wednesday that he will be making his return to Broadway in the Tony Award-winning production of “Dear Evan Hansen.” Matarazzo will play the role of Jared Kleinman beginning July 19, reports Deadline. “Words could never express how truly honored I am to be a part of this company,” Matarazzo said in a statement. “This show has taught me so much about myself and to be able to participate in any capacity, let alone on Broadway, makes me want to melt. I am ecstatic to be back on stage and eternally grateful for the opportunity.” Matarazzo made his Broadway debut in the 2011 production of “Priscilla Queen of the Desert” and later returned in 2014 to play Gavroche in “Les Misérables.” In 2019, Matarazzo was cast as Jack in the Hollywood Bowl production of “Into the Woods.” He is due to start his open-ended run on July 19 at the Music Box Theatre. Volume 1 of the latest and final season of “Stranger Things” will be available for streaming on Netflix on Friday, May 27. Volume 2 begins July 1.
