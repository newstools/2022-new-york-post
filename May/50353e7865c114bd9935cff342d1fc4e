A Connecticut teenager and his grandfather were busted for running a ghost-gun operation out of their backyard, cops said Monday. Cops in East Hampton, Conn. were tipped off by a neighbor that said the teen had been illegally manufacturing AR-15 assault rifles, according to officials. Clayton Hobby, 18, was initially identified as a suspect. Investigators later learned that his grandfather, Kerry Schunk, 64, was also working with him to manufacture the weapons, East Hampton police said. Authorities seized multiple ghost gun AR-15 rifles in “various stages of assembly,” including one that was converted to shoot fully automatic, according to officials. Three ghost gun polymer handguns, 15 high capacity magazines, and approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition were also seized, police said. Ghost guns are weapons that are built from a kit that is untraceable to evade detection and regulation. Hobby faced 23 counts of gun making and weapons possession charges and was being held on a $250,000 bond, according to a press release. Schunk was charged with 22 conspiracy counts in connection with the operation, and one charge of interfering with an officer. He was held on a $100,000 bond, police said. Police in nearby New York City recently reported a staggering increase in ghost guns turning up in the five boroughs.
