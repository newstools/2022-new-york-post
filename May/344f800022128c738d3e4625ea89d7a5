The lipstick we wear. The body spray we spritz. The soap we use. If not chosen carefully, each of those products, and more, release harmful chemicals on and into our bodies. While a single chemical exposure isn’t likely to cause severe harm, overtime, they pose a greater risk. To avoid the risk all together, many are turning to clean beauty products. The issue? They aren’t exactly cheap. Luckily, Follain, a leading clean beauty brand, is offering customers 20% off sitewide for their quarterly sale and free shipping. Therefore, customers can shop clean beauty brands such as Indie Lee, Ilia, RMS Beauty and more — at 20% off. But we wouldn’t wait, as this sale ends on May 19.
