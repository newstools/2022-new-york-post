A man was shot on Farmers Boulevard in Queens early Saturday, police said. The 25-year-old victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital where he is reportedly in stable condition, cops said. The shooting occurred just before 1 a.m., near the corner of Farmers Boulevard and 115th Avenue. The victim is not cooperating with police, according to the NYPD, so little is known about who shot him or why — or even if the shooting occurred inside or outside the location. The investigation into the shooting is continuing, police said.
