Two pivotal Game 5’s occupy today’s NBA card and Munaf Manji of The Action Network is here to share his favorite player prop bet for each (video above). His first bet comes in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals between the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers. In that tilt, he’s backing James Harden over 4.5 turnovers on BetMGM.  Even though Harden had a big fourth-quarter in Game Four, he’s been turning the ball over at an alarming rate. “[Harden] has gone over this projection in three out of four games so far against the Miami Heat,” Manji says. The Heat defense has also troubled opposing point guards all season long and in the first round against Trae Young, who had five or more turnovers in four of five against the Heat. With the Heat back on its home floor, expect a strong defensive effort as it forces at least five turnovers out of Harden.  For his second prop bet, Manji is looking to Game Five of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns. In that game, he’s backing Chris Paul over 30.5 points + rebounds + assists on DraftKings. Paul fouled out in Game Four after a disappointing performance in Game Three, but Manji expects him to turn in a strong performance in Game Five. “In their home games, CP3 is averaging 23.2 points, 9.2 assists and five rebounds per game,” Manji says. Paul has also cleared this projection in four of five home games so far this postseason. For those reasons, Manji likes betting on a bounce-back performance from Paul on Tuesday.
