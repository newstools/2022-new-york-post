The Long Island woman jailed for manslaughter in the shoving death of an elderly Manhattan voice coach should not be behind bars, her lawyer contends in new court filing. Lauren Pazienza is being held at Rikers Island pending trial on manslaughter and assault charges for the death of Barbara Maier Gustern, after Justice Felicia Menin ruled earlier this month that she was a “serious flight risk.” Pazienza, 26, who has pleaded not guilty, was initially released on $500,000 bail before Menin threw her back in jail. Pazienza should get a new bail hearing because Menin didn’t consider options like home confinement, treatment programs or electronic monitoring, according to a Manhattan Supreme Court filing from her lawyers. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday. Pazienza, an event organizer and scion of a lucrative cesspool empire, allegedly called Gustern a “bitch” before pushing her in an unprovoked attack in Chelsea on March 10, police said. Gustern fell and hit her head, dying from her injuries five days later. Gustern was a vocal coach whose clients included “Blondie’s” Debbie Harry. Pazienza faces between five and 25 years behind bars if convicted.
