Costco shoppers love the store’s low prices, but they can save even more by paying attention to the price tags. Before you buy a bulk box of your favorite cereal, take a look at the price to see if it ends in .97. If the price of an item ends in 97 cents it’s been marked down, meaning extra savings. Prices that end in .88 or .00 are often returned or display items that have a special manager’s discount, reports Best Life. Also, be on the lookout for any price tags with an asterisk. That means the item won’t be restocked so make sure you buy it while you can. This isn’t the only way to save some extra cash at Costco. Superfans say the farther you walk into the store, the better the deals you will find. The center of the store, known as “center court”, is said to offer great deals, too. The tip is to start in the back of the store and work your way up. According to a Costco employee on Reddit, Costco will pay customers the difference if an item goes on sale less than 30 days after they bought it. The same employee said customers do not need to show a receipt. Costco’s website states customers can visit the returns counter for the price adjustment. The process may be different for online orders. Gas stations are located at most warehouse locations. Reddit users say prices can often be 20 cents cheaper than other gas stations, but we’ve found examples of up to 30 cents. Note that gas prices vary by location. Costco Next is a new, lesser known section of the Costco website. While shopping Costco Next, members have the opportunity to purchase products directly from a supplier’s site, where they can enjoy special members-only prices.
