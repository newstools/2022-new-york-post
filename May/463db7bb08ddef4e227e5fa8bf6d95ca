Before Whitney Houston came along as “the love of my life,” Bobby Brown was taking every little step to woo another superstar pop diva: Janet Jackson. “Janet was the crush of my life,” says the 53-year-old singer in the new documentary “Biography: Bobby Brown,” which premieres on A&E on Monday and Tuesday nights. Indeed, before the “My Prerogative” crooner even met future wife Houston backstage at the “Soul Train Music Awards” in 1989, Brown was all for Janet. “What was it about Janet? Everything. Her little smile, body, her dance moves, her little laugh,” he says in the doc. After all these years, Brown still sounds a little smitten with the “When I Think of You” songbird, remembering their fling fondly. “We loved each other’s company,” he says. But, he adds, “We didn’t have that long of a relationship.” Ultimately, though, Brown believes that it didn’t work out between the singing sweethearts because he was more “hood” than Hollywood. “The reason me and Janet broke off was because she couldn’t be with a man like myself,” he says. “I’m from the projects. I’m hood. And her father [Joe Jackson] wouldn’t allow her to be with someone like me.” Brown — who admits to having been a “sex addict” in the two-night documentary — also reveals that he had a tryst with the Queen of Pop herself, Madonna. “Did I sleep with Madonna? We didn’t do any sleeping,” he says slyly. “It just happened. I don’t even know how it happened . . . She probably knows how it happened. But we didn’t do no sleeping.”
