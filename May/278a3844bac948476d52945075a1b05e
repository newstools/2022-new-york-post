It’s looking as if Antonio Brown’s last moment on a football field may have come when he did a shirtless sprint to the locker room during the Jan. 2 game between the Jets and Buccaneers at MetLife Stadium. The controversial wide receiver, who was interviewed during a Fan Controlled Football game on Saturday, said he is done with the NFL, at least for next season. “Obviously, we live the game, but you can’t play forever,” Brown said. “I think I’m a great player that’s done everything in the game.” Brown asked if he would suit up in 2022, then said: “Nah, don’t play yourself looking at me to play.” Brown told TMZ in March, nearly three months after his controversial exit, that he had yet to undergo surgery on his ankle and wouldn’t get it repaired until he signs with a new NFL team. “I need to get my ankle fixed, but I just want to make sure I’ve got an obligation or a commitment from a team,” Brown told the website. “It’s a lot for a guy to go through surgery without an idea of where you’re gonna work or who you’re gonna work for. I think as a player, I understand that I can do all the things in my physical life and move and function normally.” Earlier this month, Brown said on social media that he wanted to retire as a Steeler, but did not want to play for Pittsburgh again. The 33-year-old receiver also was recently caught up in an Instagram drama with R&B singer Keyshia Cole and said in another interview that he didn’t want to be compared to former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. If this is the end of Brown’s career, he will finish with 928 receptions for 12,291 yards and 83 touchdowns.
