The Penguins-Rangers series is a fascinating test case for NHL bettors. For the most part, seasoned hockey handicappers will tell you that 5-on-5 numbers are the most important thing to bake into your handicap. And if that is the case, all signs point to the Penguins. Not only were the Penguins the better 5-on-5 team in the regular season, but they have completely controlled play at even strength through the first 8-plus periods of this series. The Penguins have skated to a 65 percent expected goals rate and have created 28 more high-danger scoring chances (47-19) than the Rangers through the first two contests. But the Rangers have the great equalizer in Igor Shesterkin, who has posted a .952 save percentage and a plus-5.9 Goals Saved Above Expected in two games. Shesterkin versus Louis Domingue is a mismatch of epic proportions, but what the two teams are asking from their goaltender is quite different. While Shesterkin is being asked to win the game for the Rangers, Domingue just needs to keep Pittsburgh afloat. He did that in Game 2, but the Pens just couldn’t beat Shesterkin with a couple of Grade A chances.  It’s not a fun bet to make, but the goaltending situation is creating some value on the Penguins, who have dominated at 5-on-5 and will be underdogs at home. The play: Penguins, +100.
