Chris Paul has no patience for ESPN’s Brian Windhorst. After Windhorst reported that Paul — not the Suns coaching staff — instituted a team curfew in New Orleans during the playoffs, Phoenix’s point guard quickly shot it down. After ESPN posted the quote from Windhorst on Instagram, Paul responded with a cap emoji, indicating the report wasn’t true. On the Brian Windhorst & the Hoop Collective podcast, Windhorst also said that Paul set up rooms in the Suns hotel to watch playoff games and play cards. Presumably, that was a way of helping them avoid the trappings of Bourbon Street. Given that it’s not in Paul’s interest to be seen as an authority figure above Suns coach Monty Williams, it’s anyone’s guess as to who to believe. In any case, though, whatever the Suns did worked. After splitting the first four games of their series against the Pelicans, the Suns closed it out by winning the last two, including Game 6 in New Orleans. Paul’s 14 straight field goals without a miss set an NBA playoff record in the 115-109 victory. The Suns will go to Dallas in the second round, a city that probably doesn’t require anyone to set a curfew — at least to anywhere near the same extent as New Orleans. Phoenix reached the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993 last season, losing to the Bucks. A title this year, after attaining the league’s best regular-season record, would be a first for both the franchise and Paul.
