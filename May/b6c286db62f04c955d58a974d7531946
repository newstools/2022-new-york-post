A Central Park West home that once housed an artist, friend and collaborator of the famed abstract painter Mark Rothko is in contract after hitting the market in April for the first time in 50 years. The late artist Bill Scharf formerly lived in this 75 Central Park West co-op — and it’s now being sold by the estate of his widow, Sally Scharf, by executors who include their son, Aaron Scharf. The couple bought this unit for $42,500 in 1973 — about $286,800 in today’s figures. Scharf passed away in 2018, at age 90. His work is in the permanent collections of various museums including the Guggenheim, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The unit was on the market for a mere two weeks. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom spread asked $1.3 million. “It was a magical place to grow up, surrounded by my father’s paintings, with Central Park feeling like the largest front yard in the world,” said Aaron Scharf. Original details in the home, located in a Rosario Candela-designed building, include oversize windows, beamed ceilings, hardwood floors and decorative moldings. The unit opens to an entrance gallery, which leads to a large living room for entertaining and an 18-foot-long kitchen. The corner master suite has views to the south and west — and a storage unit comes with the sale. The listing brokers are Triplemint’s Jed Lewin and Lauren Viviani.
