The start of fall season is still four months away, but the returning network shows are already gearing up for their next go-round in primetime with hardly any time to celebrate their good fortune. The growth of streaming television and other platforms has severely weakened viewership for comedies and dramas on traditional broadcast TV; on the other hand, it’s also given a new lease on life to shows that might once have been cancelled due to low ratings — since the renewal bar has been significantly lowered as the networks try to hold on to their dwindling audiences in a fractured landscape. That’s good news for fans of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox — which retained a fair number of their shows unlike The CW, which cancelled nine series going into the new season. With the networks firming up their fall schedules this week, it’s a good time to circle back to the returning tried-and-true favorites.
