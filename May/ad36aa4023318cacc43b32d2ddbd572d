The body of a 15-year-old New Jersey boy was found Sunday — a day after he went missing while cliff jumping with pals in an off-limits reservoir, according to officials. The Paterson teen, who has not been identified, was found by police scuba divers in Woodland Park on Sunday after rescuers “worked tirelessly in the heat on land, water and in the sky,” Passaic County Sheriff Richard Berdnik said. “The incident began on Saturday and concluded today with recovery of a 15-year-old boy who drowned,” he confirmed, asking residents to “keep the family in your thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time.” “Although the outcome was not what we all hoped for, at least closure will be given to the family,” he wrote in a Facebook post. Officials previously told NJ.com that the teen was with a group of friends who went to the reservoir, where swimming is prohibited. Friends told responding officers that they were “cliff jumping” when the boy jumped in, but was unable to swim, Woodland Park police Capt. Michael Brady told the local outlet. Some of the friends tried to help him, but “were being pulled down and were unable to secure the victim,” Brady added. The boy’s body was finally found the next day “within the vicinity” of where he was last seen, Woodland Park Mayor Keith Kazmark told the outlet. “This is a tragic day. The family’s upset, understandably so,” said Kazmark, moments after speaking with the boy’s family. He said the boy’s identity was not disclosed “out of respect for the family.” “At this point, we have to respect their privacy and this period of mourning for them,” he told NJ.com. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to them at this very difficult time.”
