The Yankees (18-7) now have played 25 games and own the best record in baseball despite their 11-game winning streak coming to an end with a 2-1 loss Wednesday night in Toronto. The balanced Bombers rank first in the American League in runs scored, home runs and ERA and second in team defense. It has been a three-pronged improvement in all facets of the game that has provided an early justification for the front office and a reason for optimism and renewed swagger among their fans. Buck Showalter and the Mets haven’t been the only impressive juggernaut in town to open the season, lest we forget. We’ll see over the next several months whether this start is sustainable for Aaron Boone’s club, which has taken four of seven from the Blue Jays in the early going and has a 95.8 percent chance of making the playoffs per Fangraphs’ projections. The Yanks have avoided adversity in the form of significant injuries and have not had their lineup and rotational depth greatly tested.
