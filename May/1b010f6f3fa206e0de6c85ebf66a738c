Either the Heat will advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, or the 76ers will force a Game Seven. Those are the two scenarios for tonight’s Game Six in Philadelphia, for which Brandon Anderson of The Action Network is here to present his best bet. Rather than looking to either side, though, Anderson is instead focusing in on a team total instead. That total? The Philadelphia 76ers ‘under’ 104.5 points -120 on DraftKings Sportsbook. For Anderson, he simply doesn’t trust Philadelphia to score against a stout Miami defense. “The Sixers shot 28 percent from three and 42 percent on twos [in Game Five],” Anderson says. Additionally, Miami’s decision to have Jimmy Butler defend Tyrese Maxey, who Anderson describes as an “X-factor” for the series, looked to unlock something for the Miami defense. In Game Five, the Heat limited Maxey to only nine points and one assist. Further, the Sixers have struggled to clear this points benchmark, even at home. Through five games in this series, Philadelphia has only notched 105 or more points once. Expand the set to its last nine games and the 76ers have only cleared this number twice.  For all those reasons, take the under on the Sixers team total tonight in Philadelphia.
