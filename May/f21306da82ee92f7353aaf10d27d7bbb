Back on its home floor, the Milwaukee Bucks have a chance to eliminate the Boston Celtics during Game 6, Friday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN. Matt Moore of The Action Network has a best bet to share (video above). Rather than picking a side, though, Moore is choosing to back the total, specifically under 211 points. The reasoning? Almost on the same level as Game Seven unders, Game Six unders have proven historically profitable. “By the time you get to Game 6, both teams have usually exhausted all their strategic advantages,” Moore explains. Additionally, both teams are playing on tired legs, a fact that Moore believes has been exacerbated in the Bucks-Celtics series. Plus, both teams possess top-notch defenses that have largely held up over this grueling five-game series. But, in terms of the betting trends, game six unders have cashed at a very high rate.  “In the first and second rounds of the NBA playoffs, the under in Game 6’s is 65-45 at 59.1 percent,” Moore details. Add in that Moore expects a lot of defensive switching and tired legs from the offenses and Moore expects this game to stay under 211 combined points, a benchmark these sides have stayed under in three of five games this series.
