David Wells once threatened to beat up the Boss. The former Yankees pitcher appeared on David Cone’s Jomboy Media podcast, “Toeing the Slab,” and recounted the time he threatened to “beat the s–t” out of George Steinbrenner’s during a testy locker room exchange. As Wells tells it, it was 1997, shortly after he joined the Yankees. He was on the receiving end of a Jeffrey Maier-type fan-interference event in right field, and told Steinbrenner to make some modifications to Yankee Stadium. “I go, ‘George, you gotta do something with that fence. Last year it benefitted you and today it hurt us,’” Wells said. “He looked at me and goes, ‘You ain’t no pitcher.’ I said, ‘Excuse me?’ He said, ‘You ain’t the pitcher I signed.’” Things escalated from there. “I looked at him and go, ‘What’s that supposed to mean?’” Wells said. “He goes, ‘Well, it is what it is.’” Wells asked: “Well if you don’t like me why don’t you trade me? He goes, ‘I tried but nobody wanted you.’” Business started to pick up. “Well, that pissed me off. I got in his face. I threatened to kick his ass. … I pitched 7-8 innings that day,” Wells recalled. “I said, ‘if you’re still in here after I get ice I’m gonna beat the s—t out of you.’ He goes, ‘I’m not afraid of you’ and he got in my face. I go, hmm, ok, we’ll see. Sure enough, I went in, got ice, and came out and he’s sitting there right in front of my locker.” From there, by Wells’ telling, he chased Steinbrenner out of the locker room. However, the next day, there would be a reconciliation. Wells said he apologized to Steinbrenner for the way he carried himself and the two had a 30-minute meeting in Joe Torre’s office. “We talked. We hashed it out,” Wells said. “He got up. He gave me a big old hug. A kiss on the cheek. He goes, ‘You’re my guy.’ That’s kind of how I won George Steinbrenner over.”
