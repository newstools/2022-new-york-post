A woman was arrested after forcing her two young daughters to drink bleach, killing one of them on Mother’s Day in Poinciana, Fla., according to local reports. Joanne Zephir, 36, confessed to police that a “voodoo spell” was the reason she forced her 3-year-old and 8-year-old daughters to drink bleach out of a drinking glass, according to WSMV. She claimed the spell caused her to harm both of her children. Police discovered Zephir unconscious in the driver’s seat of a vehicle parked at the Poinciana Pentecostal Church. The younger girl was also found unresponsive in the backseat and the older daughter was found out on a road near the church, according to the Sun. All three of them were taken to a local hospital, where the 3-year-old was pronounced dead. Police are expected to charge Zephir with one count of attempted murder and one count of aggravated child abuse.
