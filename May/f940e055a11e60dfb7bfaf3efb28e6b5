Can the guy who took over a team led by Brook Lopez, Bojan Bogdanović and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson be LeBron James’ next coach? Kenny Atkinson, who coached the Nets from 2016-20, is one of three finalists for the Lakers’ head coaching job, The Athletic reported on Friday. Bucks assistant Darvin Ham and former Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts are his competition, and all three are expected to take part in in-person interviews in Los Angeles. Atkinson currently is a Warriors assistant coach. Most believe he did an excellent job in his four seasons in Brooklyn, where he oversaw developments of prospects such as D’Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie and helped the Nets reach the postseason in 2019. But the Nets no longer needed to be developed when they landed Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, and Atkinson was fired and Steve Nash brought in before Durant had played a game with the team. Ham, a former NBA journeyman, has been an assistant coach in the league since 2011, going from the Lakers to the Hawks to the Bucks. Because he coached in L.A. for two seasons, he should know team president Jeanie Buss well. Stotts coached Portland for nine largely successful seasons in which his teams went 720-402. He took the Blazers to the playoffs in eight straight seasons but never advanced to the Finals and was fired after the 2020-21 campaign.
