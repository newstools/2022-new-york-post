The Goldman Sachs executive shot dead on a Manhattan subway train was remembered Tuesday as a loyal and beloved family man. Hundreds of mourners lined up outside Transfiguration Roman Catholic Church in Williamsburg to pay their respects to Daniel Enriquez, just 10 days after he was gunned down in a random Big Apple subway attack. “There aren’t words to describe him,” Ruperto Enriquez, the slain man’s father, said at the funeral. “His presence, his smile. He was a positive person 100%. If you had a problem, he’d help you find a solution. “I’m happy because he’s in a better place,” said the elder Enriquez, who flew in from Seattle to attend his son’s funeral. “We are Catholic. We have faith in what the bishop said. That’s what we believe.” Among those attending the funeral for Enriquez was Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. More than 600 people packed the church for the funeral on Tuesday morning. Inside the chapel, a montage of photographs depicted Enriquez surrounded by family and friends. The 48-year-old executive was riding the Q train into Manhattan on May 22 to have brunch with friends when he was shot in the chest and mortally wounded by a vagrant. Andrew Abdullah, 25, was arrested and arraigned on second-degree murder charges in the case three days later. The slain man’s partner of 18 years, Adam Pollack, 54, later told The Post that Enriquez had started taking the subways about two weeks before he was killed after Uber raised its fees. “He wasn’t a subway person,” he told The Post on May 23. “It was the surge pricing, the $40 each way. He just didn’t want to.” “It’s sad to lose a family member, especially in that way, like, senseless,” Enriquez’s cousin, Jaime Quiroz. “We are here to support the family. “Besides being smart, he really loved his family,” said Quiroz, who flew in from California. “He really cared about everybody. He had a big heart.” Enriquez is being buried at St. John Cemetery in Middle Village.
