Much like the Rams’ Sean McVay and Les Snead, some members of the Patriots also had candid reactions to Bill Belichick’s moves on night one of the 2022 NFL Draft. New England receiver Kendrick Bourne recently gave fans a peek inside teammate Mac Jones’ draft party from the first round, which featured a hibachi dinner and prime viewing of the first round. Although Bourne seemed hopeful for a splashy selection with the 21st overall pick, the Patriots stunned him instead by opting to trade down. “Oh my f–king goodness. Oh my gosh, bro,” Bourne said in a YouTube video posted Wednesday. “Bro, what the f–k? Bro, I’m out of here — this some bulls–t, I’ve been waiting over here for f–king hours!” As the clip continued, Bourne laughs as he captures fellow guests reacting to the move, which resulted in the Kansas City Chiefs grabbing Washington corner Trent McDuffie. “What the f–k? I’ve been waiting all day for this s–t,” Bourne exclaimed with a smile. By trading back, the Patriots received a pair of picks from the Chiefs, as well as Kansas City’s first-round selection. Once New England was on the clock again, it decided to throw in another surprise by grabbing Chattanooga guard Cole Strange at No. 29, despite the player being projected as a third-round pick. Last year, the Patriots drafted Tom Brady’s replacement in Jones at No. 15 overall. The former Alabama product helped lead them to a playoff berth before they were blown out by the Bills in January’s wild-card round. Perhaps Jones and company will make a return trip to the postseason in 2023, but this time, with some new — and unexpected — rookies in tow.
