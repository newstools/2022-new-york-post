Jena Sims is giving the people what they want. Taking to Instagram, the soon-to-be Mrs. Brooks Koepka shared more photos from her April bachelorette bash in Aruba, where she celebrated with her nearest and dearest. “Bachelorette content is never over ,” Sims recently quipped in the post’s caption. In one photo, Sims is seen splashing around in the water as she hangs with a flamingo and her gal pals, and dancing in a white bikini in another. Other shots appear to feature moments captured from inside the group’s private jet. Sims, 33, who announced her engagement to Koepka, 32, last year, previously gushed about her bachelorette party on social media, telling her followers that she was “still speechless” over the epic trip. “I cried so many happy tears seeing my friends from different phases of my life (childhood, college, pageants, Los Angeles, and now Jupiter) bonding and forming relationships.  I felt so celebrated, loved, and present,” she posted last month. Before jetting off to an island paradise, Sims supported Koepka at the 2022 Masters. During the tournament, which took place in early April, the Steve Madden collaborator participated in the annual par-3 event, in which the loved ones of golfers act as their caddies. Sims and Koepka will soon be tying the knot in a destination wedding. Although many of the details are under wraps, Sims told The Post last month the longtime couple isn’t sweating the small stuff in terms of wedding plans. “We’re not too hung up on just the extravagance, we want — at the end of the day, we’re marrying each other, we already feel like we’re married,” Sims said. “We just want everyone to have a good time, and not stress about some of the big details.”
