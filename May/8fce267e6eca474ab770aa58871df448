Paige VanZant is giving fans an authentic look at the “real” her. In a video posted Wednesday, the All Elite Wrestling star — who boasts over three million followers on Instagram — showcased her interpretation of what social media sees versus her at-home persona. VanZant, 28, is first seen looking glammed up while modeling a low-cut shirt, displaying “what social media sees.” The video then transitions to VanZant rocking out in her kitchen in comfy clothes, quipping this version of herself is what husband Austin Vanderford “sees.” “IT IS THE REAL ME!!!!” she captioned the Instagram video. VanZant has amassed a major online following over the years, including subscribers to her exclusive content site, PaigeFanZant.com. During the COVID-19 pandemic, VanZant and Vanderford, 32, engaged in naked at-home photo shoots. The snaps in question featured the pair, who have been married since 2018, working out in their birthday suits, as well as cooking in their kitchen. In a January 2021 interview with “Morning Kombat,” VanZant said the now-famous series “wasn’t planned.” “That wasn’t a planned thing at all. It was quarantine, we stayed home for two weeks straight, it was kind of when this all first started,” VanZant said at the time. “And we’re like, ‘All right, we’re not leaving our house,’ and, as husbands and wives do, we’re just naked and walking around our house, doing our thing.” In recent weeks, however, VanZant has shown off her high-seas adventures on social media, as well as inside looks at sultry photo shoots.
