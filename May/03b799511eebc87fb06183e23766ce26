A sidewalk accordion player is making Upper West Siders sing the blues. Russian-born Vadim Klimenko set up shop on West 74th Street and Broadway about a year ago, cranking out classics such as “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head” and  “America” from “West Side Story” for hours on end . “It’s good for about five minutes,” sniffed a 70-something local who asked that her name not be used. “I didn’t sign up for this when choosing to live here and I don’t think the noise level is appropriate,” neighbor Rachel Rodgers griped on the Nextdoor app. Rodgers said she filed a complaint with the 20th Precinct last year about the maddening polka-geist. Cops “got rid of him through winter,” but he’s since returned, she wrote. “He stays there for hours on end each day, playing super loudly, the same songs and never moves around.” This week The Post caught the 54-year-old’s return engagement. Some passersby left tips, while others danced and others just ignored him. After about an hour, cops showed up and told him to unplug his amplifier and vamoose. The accordionist lifted his baseball cap and scratched his head. He wasn’t fined or arrested. “People living nearby complained about the noise,” Klimenko said as he packed up. Klimenko who also performs at restaurants and in Central Park, said “Everything is OK” and he was “not angry” that someone dropped a dime on him. “Many people like that I play the accordion there,” he said, claiming one fan even “collected feedback from local residents about how they like my work, and handed me eight sheets of thanks.”
