And she will be flipped. House-flipping Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, 43, has sold his $51 million Los Angeles mansion just over a month after buying a $52 million compound in celebrity-studded Montecito, California. Levine listed his former 3-acre LA property, in the city’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood, less than two months ago for $57.5 million, Mansion Global reported. While Levine and his wife, 33-year-old model Behati Prinsloo, made 11% less than they’d hoped on the 10-bedroom, 14-bathroom estate, they still turned a $19 million profit. The couple paid then-spouses Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner $31.95 million for the property in 2018. The now-exes had lived in the 9,000-square-foot house — which boasts a walk-in refrigerator, a theater and a game room, among other amenities — since 2009. The home is “the epitome of the true California lifestyle,” listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency previously told Mansion Global. In addition to the primary house, the address also features a four-bedroom guest cottage, an office, a wellness building and, on the landscaped grounds, a basketball court, an outdoor kitchen, a chicken coop, a spa and, naturally, a pool. The sale follows Levine and Prinsloo shelling out eight figures for Brat Pack actor Rob Lowe’s former Southern California Trophy mansion earlier this spring. The couple bought the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom, 3.5-acre property from health care private equity executive Jack McGinley. Lowe and his wife, jewelry designer Sheryl Berkoff, purchased the plot in 2005 and had its 10,000-square-foot estate custom-built using Lowe’s childhood memories of the Virginia countryside as architectural inspiration. They sold it — one of three homes they owned in Montecito at the time — for $44.5 million in 2020, The Post previously reported. The purchase was not Levine and Prinsloo’s first in Montecito. In 2021, the pair bought and sold an estate for a $5.8 million profit.
