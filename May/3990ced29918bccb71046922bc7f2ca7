A stranger attacked a 19-year-old man with a hatchet in a broad-daylight Chelsea attack Monday, new video shows. The suspect approached the victim — who was riding a bike at West 26th Street and Sixth Avenue — just before 10 a.m. and started yelling something incomprehensible, sparking a dispute, cops said. Then he swung a hatchet and struck the teen in the leg and foot, while he was still on his bike, video released later Monday shows. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, authorities said. The assailant fled along Sixth Avenue on a black moped, cops said. Police were still looking for him Tuesday.
