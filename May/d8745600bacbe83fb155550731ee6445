A woman ignited a book and piece of cloth and hurled it through the gate of a Gramercy Park synagogue, according to police, who released video footage of the alleged firebug. The disturbing incident — which is being investigated as a hate crime — happened at 1:30 a.m. Thursday at the Brotherhood Synagogue on Gramercy Park South, near 3rd Avenue, cops said. There was no serious damage to the building, police said. The NYPD late Friday night released a 16-second video clip seeking the public’s help in identifying the suspect, who ran off. The clip shows the woman — wearing glasses, dressed in black, carrying a green shopping bag and sporting a white baseball cap — walking. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s confidential Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
