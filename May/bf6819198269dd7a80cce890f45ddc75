Buck Showalter will not be in the dugout Monday night when the Mets kick off a big series against the Braves. Shortly before first pitch, MLB announced it had suspended Showalter for one game and fined him an undisclosed amount for Yoan Lopez throwing at Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber on Sunday night. The league deemed the pitch “intentional,” leading to the discipline that also included Lopez being fined and suspended for three games. Bench coach Glenn Sherlock was expected to step up in Showalter’s absence. Lopez, who was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse on Monday, threw inside to Schwarber in the ninth inning before hitting Alec Bohm with a changeup. The sequence came after Phillies pitcher Christopher Sanchez plunked Francisco Lindor in the bottom of the eighth. Showalter has been vocal about his displeasure with the Mets getting hit by pitches plenty this season – an MLB-high 20 times entering Monday. The veteran manager also missed a game earlier this season to undergo a medical procedure.
