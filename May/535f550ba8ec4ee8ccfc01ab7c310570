Before Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals tips off, Brandon Anderson of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The Celtics, who bring a 3-2 series lead back to Boston, arrive at a potential close-out game as consensus eight-and-a-half-point favorites with a few books sitting on Celtics -9. However, Anderson is staying away from both the spread and total and is instead focusing on a single-game parlay for tonight’s contest. Odds via BetMGM. For the first leg of his parlay, Anderson is using the Celtics moneyline and simply backing it to win the game. “I think that the Boston Celtics probably have this thing wrapped up,” Anderson says. The Celtics have now won two straight contests by a combined 33 points — including a 20-point victory in Game 4 at home — so Anderson believes that leg is a safe bet. But, Anderson is getting a little more creative for his second leg and targeting Jimmy Butler under 21.5 points. Anderson believes Butler is playing hurt – as evidenced by his recent lack of production. “[Butler] only scored 13 points on 4-of-18 shooting in this most recent game,” Anderson says. “In the last three games, Butler has only 27 combined points.” Combining those two angles together gets bettors to +150 for a One-Game Parlay on BetMGM. For Anderson, that’s good value as he believes there’s strong correlation between a lack of production from Butler and the Heat losing tonight. If, however, the single-game parlay doesn’t appeal, Anderson recommends searching out alternate unders on Butler’s points prop to try and find plus-money outcomes.
