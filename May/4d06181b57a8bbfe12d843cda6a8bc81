The ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive around the northeastern city of Kharkiv has pushed Russian troops out of Ukraine and back over the border, officials in Kyiv said Monday. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense posted a video on Facebook Monday showing troops with the 227 Battalion 127th Brigade of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces standing at a blue and yellow border post. “Together for the win!” the ministry posted. Ukrainian claims of reaching the Russian border come after a swift series of Ukrainian counterattacks outside Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Ukrainian forces last week succeeded in pushing Russian artillery out of range of the city, taking back a series of northern suburbs in the process. Kharkiv is located in northeastern Ukraine, some 25 miles from the northern border with Russia. Oleh Sinegubov, governor of the Kharkiv oblast, praised the troops on Telegram. “We thank everyone who, risking their lives, liberates Ukraine from Russian invaders,” he wrote. “We still have a lot of work ahead of us, together — to victory! Glory to Ukraine!” Further east, in the Donbas region where Russia has been focusing its efforts, fighting remained fierce, with town-to-town battles and reports of heavy casualties on both sides. Russian bombardments — a near-constant presence in the war — continued in the east, and Russia claimed on Monday to have shot down three Ukrainian fighter jets. With Post wires
