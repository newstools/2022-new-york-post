At least two people are dead and eight others injured after a mass shooting Thursday night near Loyola University in Chicago, police said. The gunman who opened fire around 10:40 p.m. was taken into custody and a weapon was recovered from the scene, police said. The shooting happened in the 800 block of North State Street in the city’s 18th District, police said. Shots rang out near the Chicago Avenue subway station and a McDonald’s at 10 E. Chicago Ave., police said. The shooting happened blocks away from Loyola’s Water Tower campus. Loyola University Chicago and the Chicago Fire Department did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Paramedics responded and took five gunshot victims and one burn victim to area hospitals, Chief Juan Hernandez, a spokesperson with the fire department, told the Chicago Tribune. One victim was in “grave” condition and the other gunshot victims were all in serious to critical condition, the outlet reported. The investigation is ongoing. The shooting happened hours before the Special Olympics Games Law Enforcement Torch Run due to take place from Soldier Field to Navy Pier in the city on Friday. The buildup to the multi-state, two-week tour sees Guardians of the Flame of Hope carry the torch during the final leg leading up to the games in Orlando on June 5.
