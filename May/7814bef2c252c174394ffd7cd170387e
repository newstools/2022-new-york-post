A 55-year-old man is wanted for allegedly fatally shooting his NYPD civilian employee girlfriend, and gravely wounding a neighbor who went to check on her Monday in Queens. Hours after the Monday morning slaying of 51-year-old Migdalia Ortega in her Ridgewood apartment, the NYPD identified the suspect as Pedro Cintron. Ortega was fighting with her boyfriend inside the apartment on Fresh Pond Road near Palmetto Street when a female neighbor showed up to see what was going on, authorities said. “During the dispute, the 48-year-old neighbor went to check on the third-floor occupant,” Deputy Chief Julie Morrill told reporters Monday afternoon. “She was in shock and fled back to her apartment. The male suspect followed her and continued shooting.” “There are shell casings throughout the hallway and stairwell.” Ortega was shot in the head and the neighbor blasted in the stomach and shoulder, cops said. Both women were rushed to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where Ortega was pronounced dead and the neighbor remains clinging to life. Ortega worked for the NYPD’s Information Technology Bureau at One Police Plaza in Manhattan, cops said. Her daughter worked with her at the NYPD, said a colleague of the pair. The gunman was wearing all black at the time of the attack and fled in a vehicle with tinted windows and no license plate, police sources said. “[Ortega’s] family has received support from the NYPD Employee Assistance Unit,” Morrill said. “We are doing everything we can to comfort them in this difficult time.” No arrests had been made by Tuesday morning.
