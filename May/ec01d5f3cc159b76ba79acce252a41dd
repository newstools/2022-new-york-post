Gov. Kathy Hochul revealed Sunday that she has the coronavirus. “Today I tested positive for COVID-19. Thankfully, I’m vaccinated and boosted, and I’m asymptomatic,” the governor wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “I’ll be isolating and working remotely this week. Hochul, 63, urged Empire State residents to get their shots and isolate if they come down with COVID-19 symptoms. “A reminder to all New Yorkers: get vaccinated and boosted, get tested, and stay home if you don’t feel well,” she said. Hochul’s positive test makes her the latest New York politician to come down with the virus. New York City Mayor Eric Adams contracted the virus last month, when he experienced minor symptoms. In February, then-Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin tested positive for COVID-19  days after attending the state Democratic Party’s convention that featured Hillary Clinton. Late last year, city Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and then-city Comptroller Scott Stringer both contracted COVID-19.
