An NYPD administrative worker was fatally shot in the head by her boyfriend in a Queens apartment early Monday, authorities and police sources said. The 51-year-old victim’s neighbor, a 48-year-old woman, also was critically hurt when she was shot in the stomach during the violence in the home on Fresh Pond Road near Palmetto Street in Ridgewood around 8:15 a.m., police said. The dead woman, identified by NYPD sources as Migdalia Ortega, was fighting with her boyfriend when the neighbor showed up to see what was going on, authorities said. “During the dispute, the 48-year-old neighbor went to check on the third-floor occupant,”  Deputy Chief Julie Morrill told reporters Monday afternoon. “She was in shock and fled back to her apartment. The male suspect followed her and continued shooting. “There are shell casings throughout the hallway and stairwell.” Ortega, who worked for the NYPD’s Information Technology Bureau at One Police Plaza in Manhattan, was pronounced dead at Elmhurst Hospital Center, cops said. Her daughter worked with her at the NYPD, said a colleague of the pair. The neighbor remains in critical condition at the same hospital, authorities said. There have been no previous reports of domestic violence involving Ortega and the suspect, according to Morrill. The suspect was wearing all black at the time of the attack and fled in a vehicle with tinted windows and no license plate, police sources said. “[Ortega’s] family has received support from the NYPD Employee Assistance Unit,” Morrill said. “We are doing everything we can to comfort them in this difficult time.”
