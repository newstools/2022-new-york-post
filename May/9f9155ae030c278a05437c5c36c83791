The charred bodies found in a burning car at a Bronx golf course Monday were identified Wednesday as a college basketball player and his gal pal — and cops said they had both been fatally shot before the vehicle was set alight. Jesse Parrilla, a 19-year-old hoopster from the Bronx who played at Genesee Community College in upstate New York, and Nikki Wong were found in the burned car on Shore Road near the Pelham/Split Rock Golf Course around 4:15 a.m. on Monday, law enforcement sources said. The pair were so badly charred that cops initially could not identify them or even tell their gender until Wednesday. Sources said the car was registered to Parrilla’s mother, Michelle Morales, and registered at the Lower East Side apartment where they live. Wong was shot in the head and Parrilla in the chest before the car was set ablaze. Police have not released a motive for the shootings nor identified a suspect. Parilla, a 6-foot guard, averaged 4.6 points per game in the 2018-2019 season at the college, which is in update Batavia, the school’s home page said.
