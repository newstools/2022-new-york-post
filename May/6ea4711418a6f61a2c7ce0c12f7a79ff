Police are searching for a man who threw a milk crate and traffic cones at a Times Square food vendor in a caught-on-camera attack earlier this month. The 57-year-old victim was approached around 6:15 p.m. May 14 at Seventh Avenue and West 40th Street, the NYPD said in a release Saturday. The two men engaged in a verbal dispute, which escalated and became physical. The attacker kicked and punched the vendor and then, “picked up a milk crate and struck the victim in the head before throwing multiple traffic cones towards the victim,” cops said, while releasing the footage. The victim suffered a cut to his head. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was treated and released. The suspect took off after the attack. He is described as a male with a dark complexion and short dark hair, who stands about 6-feet-2-inches tall and weighs 160-pounds. He was last seen wearing a black surgical mask, back sweatpants, a black t-shirt, a backpack and gray Crocs. Anyone with information in regard to the incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
