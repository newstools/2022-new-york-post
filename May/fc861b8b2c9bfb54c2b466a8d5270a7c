London is calling the Giants. The Giants will face the Packers in London at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Oct. 9, the league announced Wednesday. It is the third time in the 15 years since the NFL started its International Series that the Giants will play overseas. The game counts as a home game for the Packers, so it’s one less trip to historic Lambeau Field and a first trip to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Giants beat the Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in the NFL’s first ever game in London in 2007 and then beat the Rams at Twickenham Stadium in 2016. Not only are the Giants undefeated in London, maybe the trip is a good-luck charm. The 2007 season ended with a Super Bowl championship and the 2016 season ended with the Giants’ most recent trip to the playoffs. The Giants are scheduled for nine home games in the second year of the NFL’s 17-game regular season. The rest of the schedule will be announced on May 12, but the Giants will face the Eagles, Cowboys and Commanders in the normal division home-and-home series; the Packers, Vikings, Jaguars, Titans and Seahawks on the road; and the Bears, Lions, Panthers, Texans, Colts and Ravens at home. The NFL also announced Vikings-Saints (Oct. 2) and Jaguars-Broncos (Oct. 30) in London, and Seahawks-Buccaneers in the NFL’s first ever game in Munich, Germany (Nov. 13).
