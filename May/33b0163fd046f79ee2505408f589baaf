Elon Musk on Tuesday night hinted at the possibility that businesses and government agencies could face a fee to use Twitter. “Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial/government users,” Musk, 50, tweeted. The tweet was a reply to a cryptic message he posted earlier about the decline of fraternal trade organizations. “Ultimately, the downfall of the Freemasons was giving away their stonecutting services for nothing,” Musk said. If the pay-to-post policy was implemented, it would be the first major social media company that would charge users to interact with its platform. Musk’s $44 billion bid to buy Twitter was accepted by the company’s board last week. The SpaceX founder — and world’s richest man — has indicated he may ease Twitter’s censorship policies, verify every user and convert the company’s headquarters into a homeless shelter. He had previously said he planned on cutting the price of the site’s $3-a-month premium membership Twitter Blue and letting members pay in Dogecoin, the tycoon’s preferred cryptocurrency.
