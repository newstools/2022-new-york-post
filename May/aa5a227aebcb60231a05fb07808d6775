Elon Musk on Thursday said a candidate “less divisive” than Donald Trump should be elected to the White House in 2024 — but the Tesla Tycoon reiterated his belief that the former president should be back on Twitter. Musk, 50, shared his opinion on Twitter, which he is set to own following last month’s approval by the social media platform’s board of his $44 billion takeover bid. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” the South African native wrote. He followed up with another political musing minutes later, sharing his belief that President Joe Biden did not have a sweeping mandate. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama,” he wrote. Since his Twitter buyout proposal, Musk has said he will ease moderation restrictions and hinted at charging businesses to use the site. Musk also said he planned to convert the company’s headquarters into a homeless shelter. Trump was permanently banned from Twitter after the riots at the Capitol last January “due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the company said. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said the company was “wrong” to ban Trump earlier this week. “Generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” the former CEO said.
