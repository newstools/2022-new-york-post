A series of roaring tornadoes caused major damage to parts of Oklahoma and Texas Wednesday evening. In Seminole, Okla., police were going door to door checking on residents after twisters tore apart buildings and littered streets with debris, officials told KWTV-TV. “The biggest challenge is just trying to locate every person. That takes some time as homes are spread out. It’s not just one big metropolis, there are homes all across the countryside there,” Oklahoma State Trooper Trooper Eric Foster said. “What we’re trying to do is make sure people do have shelter.” Footage captured by KOCO-TV’s helicopter camera showed the frightening moments when multiple tornadoes formed across the landscape, including one that hit a cannabis farm in the town of Maud. The Academy of Seminole, a public charter school, was among the buildings damaged, officials wrote on Facebook. “Our school took a direct hit from the tornado this evening,” the academy posted. “We will be accessing the damage over the next few days. Please do not come to the school: it is extremely dangerous. Everyone who was at the school is safe.” Some 12,000 power outages were reported in Seminole County in the tornados’ wake. The Red Cross had opened a shelter at Seminole State College for anyone left homeless by the roaring storms. “Extensive structural damage” was seen in Lockett, Tex., near the border of the Sooner State, police told The Weather Channel. Storm chasers captured dramatic footage of a massive twister spinning near giant windmills in Truscott, Tex., video posted by the outlet showed. Large balls of hail that were nearly as large as baseballs were also reported in the region, according to field researchers. No injuries or fatalities were immediately reported from the storms.
