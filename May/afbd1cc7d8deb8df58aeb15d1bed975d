When Charlie Ward became the football coach at Booker T. Washington High School in Pensacola, Fla., in 2014, the cash-strapped program received an unlikely financial donation. It came from the Louisiana-based PJ Brown Foundation, run by the former Nets and Miami Heat power forward. Ward mentioned this to me Saturday on the 25th anniversary of the infamous brawl during Game 5 of the Knicks-Heat 1997 Eastern Conference semifinals in Miami that was sparked by Ward and Brown. It became “The Box-Out Heard ’Round the World.’’ “We apologized to one another the next season,” Ward told Sports+. “There’s no bad blood. We’re both the same type of person, both understood of the magnitude of what transpired. It was out of character. He was a Christian brother, and we were in chapel together before that game. No need to carry on that one.”
