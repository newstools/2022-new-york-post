Eating healthy sure isn’t easy. From knowing whether you should pick low-fat, low-carb, low-sodium, or low sugar to standing in the grocery store not knowing where to start, it’s easy to give up on making lifestyle changes. One good way to make sure you’re eating nutrition-filled foods? Meal planning! Does that sound intimidating? It doesn’t have to be. There’s actually an app for that, thanks to the mDiet Personal Meal Planning Web and Mobile App. And right now a five-year subscription to this effective solution to healthier eating can be yours for just $59.99 — that’s only $1 a month! We’re all busy these days, so who has time for lengthy meal planning and writing extensive grocery lists? Let mDiet do all the work for you, and all you’ll have to do is buy the foods from the grocery store (or place the Instacart order). This five year subscription breaks it down to just $12 a year for this service (or $1 a month!), which is a lot less than paying a nutritionist would cost. Don’t worry about counting calories or points or wondering if you’re getting enough protein or fat. Just turn to mDiet to do the planning for you and get access to their meal plan recommendations that have been designed by clinical experts. The app syncs with your Fitbit and offers you a My Meals screen that lets you exchange foods according to your preferences. And if you’d like to incorporate custom foods, there’s a barcode scanner too. With 4.8 stars on Capterra and an impressive 5-star rating on SourceForge, users are loving the ease that mDiet brings to their life. Find out how easy healthy eating can be with a five-year subscription to mDiet Personal Meal Planning Web and Mobile App for just $59.99 now. Prices subject to change.
