It’s official visit season for Arch Manning. The top-rated recruit in the country will be visiting Georgia the first weekend in June, followed by Alabama and Texas the following two weekends as recruitment begins to wind down. Some have considered him a Georgia lean, particularly after comments he made to On3 about the school. “Athens is probably the best college town I’ve ever been to,” Manning recently said. “I love coach Kirby (Smart) and he’s a real normal guy, a great coach. Georgia, the takeaway from practice there, is that they have athletes all over the field, especially on the defensive line. They have some studs and it shows: they had 15 players drafted.” Manning has been considered a future stud for a while now, and not just because of his famous bloodlines. In three years for Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, he has thrown for more than 6,300 yards and 81 touchdowns, along with 19 rushing scores.
