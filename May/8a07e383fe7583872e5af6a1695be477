A TikToker shared a bombshell claim about milk used at a Dunkin’ Donuts where she used to work. TikToker @maryamazeemm_ said she discovered the “big secret” after her Dunkin’ ran out of milk while making lattes one day. She captioned the video: “for legal purposes this doesn’t represent dunkin as a whole, i still [love] them. this was just my old manager lol.” The TikToker’s video starts with on-screen text that reads “tell me about a secret u discovered while working at fast food or retail.” She starts her story by recalling a time when she was making lattes and ran out of milk, which “always happens,” she said. So she went to the fridge to grab milk. “And usually, you know, you don’t think twice, you just grab whatever you need and go,” the TikToker said. But her coworker reportedly noticed that the dates on the milk carton had been scratched out, the TikToker claimed. The two employees then looked at all of the milk cartons in the fridge, she said. “All the dates were scratched out and there was a new date,” she claimed. She further alleged: “When we looked, they were expired, from a few weeks to a month old.” “This entire time at our Dunkin, we were serving expired milk.” The TikToker then claims that customers had complained about the taste of their drinks, but she didn’t think much of it “because my town is just like that, just annoying as f**k.” “But the whole time it’s because it was expired milk.” The video has been viewed more than 571,000 times and has more than 7,000 comments. Dunkin’ did not immediately respond to The Sun’s requests for comment on Thursday. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
