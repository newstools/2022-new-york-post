A Florida woman was arrested Wednesday for allegedly pocketing more than $10,000 from a fund created to pay for some Boy Scouts’ trip to Europe. Robin DeRushie, 44, was working as a district committee member for a Scout troop in Cocoa, Florida, when in January 2022 she was entrusted to deposit $10,385 into an account for the trip. According to a probable cause affidavit obtained by The Post, DeRushie “comingled the Boy Scouts money with personal funds and made personal purchases.” A Brevard County sheriff’s deputy wrote that the suspect “believes she is entitled to all the money.” A complaint against DeRushie was filed April 26, leading to her arrest a week later on a charge of grand theft of $10,000 or more, a third-degree felony. DeRushie was released from jail Wednesday after posting a $2,000 bond. Her initial court appearance took place this afternoon, but she was not present for it.
