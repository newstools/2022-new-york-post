Do you think you trust people deep down? An optical illusion may reveal your true feelings. A YouTube video asked viewers to choose whether they saw a face or a tail in a cartoon image – so what do you see? If you can see the face of a dog, it could mean you are “super friendly” and always the “center of attention”. The Bright Side video, which has racked up 235,500 views, said: “You’re also protective and loyal.” However, it is possible to see a dog tail too. The video added: “If it’s a dog tail to you, you’re likely more reserved and don’t trust people easily.” Did you see the tail or face first? Many people were impressed at the illusion, with one person saying: “I found this very interesting.” Another added: “What if you look at a picture and you immediately see both things??” A third commented: “Love these optical illusion drawings, it’s interesting to see if others see the same or different.” If you liked this illusion, Bright Side offered a number of different ones on their channel. One asked people to decide if they could see a woman looking out of the window or a skull. It explained: “If you notice the woman looking out of the window first, you may tend to overlook dangers. “You might even risk your life without realizing it. “You’re sometimes too spontaneous and a bit naïve. “That’s why you may often find yourself unprepared for unpleasant consequences.” Was it a skull that you saw first? The video explains: “If it was a skull you noticed first? “If so, you’re a realist rather than an idealist. “You probably come across as a bit cynical to people who don’t know you well, but your line of thinking is that all good things may come to an end one day.” This story originally appeared on the Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
