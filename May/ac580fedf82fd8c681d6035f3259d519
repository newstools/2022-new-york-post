Your iPhone has a handy trick that can help you nod off to sleep. Apple has built a selection of snooze-friendly sounds into the phone. That includes rain sounds and even white noise. These iPhone noises are designed to help you shut out the world around you. There are plenty of reasons you might want to, including trying to get to sleep. Maybe you’re trying to sleep in a strange location, or on a long flight or train ride. White noise and rain sounds have both been linked to better sleep. Thankfully, Apple offers a whole range of sounds on the iPhone for shutting out the world. There are six options to choose from: The first time that you use them, you’ll need to download them from Apple. But it only takes a few seconds with a good internet connection. Go into your Settings app, then choose Accessibility > Audio/Visual > Background Sounds. Now switch the Background Sounds toggle at the top of the page to the ON position. Then go into Sound and choose one that you like. You can then set a volume, and even choose whether you’d like the background noise to play during media. That means you could have soothing rain sounds while listening to a podcast. If you don’t want to navigate to this menu every time, you can create a shortcut. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut and then choose Background Sounds. Now when you triple-click the side button on your iPhone, your chosen Background Sounds will play. You can also add it as an option on your Control Centre too. This means you can tap the ear icon to activate or deactivate Background Sounds from the Control Centre at any time.
