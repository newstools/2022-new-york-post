A convicted rapist who was recently released from prison allegedly returned to the street where he committed his crime and sexually assaulted a woman, authorities said. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police arrested Robert Lamar McFadden on two counts of first-degree rape and two counts of first degree sex offense, authorities said. McFadden, 28 is accused of entering the victim’s  Charlotte home through a window and sexually assaulting her Thursday morning, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said in a series of tweets. McFadden attacked the 63-year-old, then forced her to drive him to a different location, police told WCNC Charlotte. He’s also facing kidnapping and burglary charges. He’s allegedly been linked to an earlier burglary in the neighborhood the same day the rape occurred, police said. McFadden had been convicted in a rape that occurred on the same block more than a decade earlier, WBTV reported. He was released from prison in April, according to the Charlotte Observer, citing prison records. McFadden, 18 at the time, was found guilty of second-degree rape, among other charges in August 2011, the Mecklenburg County’s District Attorney’s Office said in a news release. In 2010, McFadden, then 16, broke into an 83-year-old’s apartment and raped her, prosecutors said. A judge sentenced him to the maximum under state law — 9 and a half to 12 years in prison.
