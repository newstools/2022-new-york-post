This season’s jewelry trends have never looked sweeter. If kitsch is your vibe, set your senses aflutter with heart-shaped gems decorated with diamonds. For those with a more demure palette, feast your eyes on mother-of-pearl offerings, ranging from dainty drop earrings to layered wrap bracelets. But if subtle is the name of your gem game, opt for a pair of huggies. Whether they’re star-studded or simply radiate a golden shine, they’re the perfect daily accent. All available at London Jewelers
