The main suspect in Madeleine McCann’s disappearance — exactly 15 years ago today — claims he was having sex in a camper van with a woman he said would provide him with an alibi. Christian Brueckner, 44, was officially named as a suspect in the toddler’s 2007 disappearance last month but was not charged with a crime. Now, the German suspect insists he wasn’t anywhere near the resort of Praia de Luz in Portugal’s Algarve region the night McCann disappeared, according to Sky News. McCann’s heartbroken parents Kate and Gerry McCann have released a statement on May 3 in light of the 15th anniversary of her disappearance. “It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It’s a very long time,” they wrote. “Regardless of outcome, Madeleine will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain.” Brueckner claims he drove his alleged sex mate to a nearby airport for her flight home the following day. He says they spent the night in a camper van in Faro — about an hour’s drive from Praia de Luz. Brueckner, referred to as Christian B in Germany due to the country’s strict privacy laws, claims the pair were stopped and photographed at a police checkpoint, according to Sky News. At airport security, the woman — who was on vacation with her parents — was arrested for having illegal pepper spray in her bag. She later appeared in court, Brueckner claims. Brueckner claims Portuguese officials must have a record of those events and should be able to track his alibi. But German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation, seemingly contradicted Brueckner’s potential alibi. Wolters said “nothing” he’s heard so far could be a valid alibi for Brueckner. “What we found out, it all went in the other direction, so was rather incriminating, without me being able to elaborate on that now,” Wolters told Sky News.
