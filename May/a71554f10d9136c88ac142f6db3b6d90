Here comes the bride – missing half her dress. A bride suddenly halted her wedding before saying her vows after realizing she forgot to put on half of her gown. In a now-viral TikTok video with 28.5 million views, Becky Jefferies is seen at the altar with her soon-to-be husband before pausing the nuptials. “Me in the middle of my wedding ceremony realizing I’d made a terrible mistake,” reads the text on the clip. “Um, pause for a moment,” she says as the officiator asks them to share their vows. Taking the microphone, she tells the wedding guests, “I just realized when I got up to the end of the aisle that I’m missing half of my dress. Maybe I could put it on now?” The guests laugh and cheer her on as she waits for someone to fetch the large, billowing skirt and train. Meanwhile, she revealed that a few nights earlier she “had a dream” that she did this exact thing. “I’m sure you guys have never been to a wedding like this before,” she joked at the altar as she fashioned the skirt around her waist. “Now I’m almost dressed.” Viewers on TikTok found the moment hilarious and applauded the bride for her confidence. “I LOVE that she didn’t apologize. It’s her day and she confidently took control of the moment,” wrote one person in the comments. “She is so sweet and not a drama queen at all, she handled the situation very well,” chimed in another. “I would’ve walked down the aisle again,” joked someone else. “Just restart everything.” Meanwhile, others thought she was second-guessing her decision to wed her then-fiancé due to the misleading caption. “For a second I thought she wouldn’t say yes,” said one bewildered viewer. “You can see the groom visibly sighing of relief,” commented another.
