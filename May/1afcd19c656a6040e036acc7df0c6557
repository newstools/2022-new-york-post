LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky’s five Republican US House incumbents have secured the GOP nomination in their bids for reelection. US Reps. Brett Guthrie, Thomas Massie, Hal Rogers and Andy Barr defeated primary opponents in Tuesday’s contests. James Comer, the GOP incumbent in the 1st District, was unopposed in the primary and will face Democrat Jimmy Ausbrooks, a professional counselor, in the general election. Guthrie defeated two challengers in the 2nd District primary. The veteran congressman holds a key assignment on health policy. He’s the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee. Guthrie said if Republicans win control of the House in November, the GOP can bring President Joe Biden’s “liberal agenda to a halt.” “This November, let’s stop Joe Biden cold and get America back on track!” Guthrie said in a statement from his campaign. If Republicans win control of the House this November, we can take Nancy Pelosi out of the Speaker’s chair and bring Joe Biden’s liberal agenda to a halt. Rogers, who has held Kentucky’s 5th District seat since the 1980s, will run against Democrat Conor Halbleib, a law school student, in the general election. Rogers is Kentucky’s longest-serving member of Congress. Massie defeated a handful of GOP challengers in Tuesday’s 4th District primary. The libertarian-minded congressman represents a district stretching across northern Kentucky. Massie won an endorsement from former President Donald Trump leading up to the primary. Kentucky’s lone Democrat in Congress, John Yarmuth, is retiring, leaving open the Louisville-area 3rd District. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, who has Yarmuth’s endorsement, is facing state Rep. Attica Scott in the district’s Democratic primary.
