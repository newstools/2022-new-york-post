Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles told reporters Tuesday that wide receiver Travis Jonsen is “no longer with the team,” following his May 30 arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence. Jonsen, 25, was arrested early Monday morning and faces a misdemeanor charge of DUI, according to the Tampa Police Department. Jonsen refused a blood-alcohol test upon his arrest, and remains in jail on a $500 bond as of Tuesday afternoon, per a news release. He faces possible suspension under the NFL’s substance abuse policy after his arrest. “We expect members of our organization to uphold the high standards that have been established,” Bucs general manager Jason Licht said in a statement. “We are aware of the situation regarding Travis Jonsen earlier this morning and will refrain from further comment at this time while the legal process continues.” Jonsen, an undrafted free agent out of Montana State, had spent the last two seasons on Tampa Bay’s practice squad, earning a Super Bowl ring in 2020. He played in all three preseason games in 2021, catching three passes for 25 yards.
