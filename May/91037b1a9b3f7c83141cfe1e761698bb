This six-bedroom, seven-bathroom modern design gem on the Hudson River is now back on the market for $5.5 million — down from its original asking price of $7.9 million in 2016. It’s the only home in the region from renowned Hamptons architect Norman Jaffe — hence its name, “Hamptons on the Hudson” — and the final house he built before he died, brokers say. The 18.1-acre property, at 1981 Broadway/Route 9W in West Park, New York, sits on the west bank of the Hudson and boasts its own private beach as well as a sauna, a tennis court and landscaped gardens. The 8,226-square-foot home features glass wall windows (with views of the nearby Vanderbilt and Roosevelt estates across the river) as well as an indoor lap pool. It was built in 1991 for the sellers, Raymond Auyang — founder of Tau Laboratories, which provides photomasks and imaging services to the chip industry — and his wife, Kwan Ching. “Building and owning this house is one of my two wishes in life come true. The other wish was marrying Kwan Ching,” Raymond tells Gimme. The Auyangs gave Jaffee full reign to design the home, which is filled with sculptural details, geometric lines and natural materials. An atrium gallery, skylight ceilings and “museum-quality” limestone floors and walls were created to showcase art. Additionally, there’s a separate five-car garage for Auyang’s auto collection (along with a separate, two-car garage for everyday driving). A distillery and winery are neighbors.
