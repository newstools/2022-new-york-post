CHICAGO — The Yankees’ pitching is better than it was a year ago, their lineup more consistent. But what might be most striking about this year’s team as compared to last season’s is its attention to detail in the field. Through Wednesday, the Yankees had the highest fielding percentage in the majors (.992), according to Fangraphs. Last year, they were tied for 23rd. And while that may not cover everything — all fielding stats are flawed — the Yankees also are noticeably better according to the more advanced metrics, such as defensive runs saved, in which they rank fifth this season after finishing 29th in 2021. The reasons are many, from having a healthy DJ LeMahieu to roam from second base to third to first; to a full season from first baseman Anthony Rizzo; to the significant addition of shortstop and the permanent move of Gleyber Torres back to second.
