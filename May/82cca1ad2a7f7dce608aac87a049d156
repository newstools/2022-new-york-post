It’s the no-hitter that’s not. Cincinnati Reds pitchers Hunter Greene and Art Warren combined to hold the Pittsburgh Pirates hitless Sunday, but it won’t count as an official no-hitter in the books because the Pirates only batted in eight innings and won 1-0. Yes, the visiting Reds didn’t give up a hit and still lost. Such is life for the owners of an MLB-worst 9-26 record. The prized prospect Geeene (1-6) walked five and struck out nine in 7 1/3 innings, and the only run scored on a fielder’s choice in the eighth after he was out of the game. He threw 118 pitches. “It would’ve been great to have a different result,” Greene told reporters afterward, “but it is what it is.” It marks just the sixth time since 1901 that a team lost despite allowing no hits. It last happened in 2008, when Jered Weaver and Jose Arredondo combined for eight no-hit innings in a road loss to the Dodgers. Greene issued two one-one walks in the eighth before he was pulled. Warren walked another to load the bases for Ke’Bryan Hayes, who grounded into a run-scoring forceout. “It’s hard on the mental side not to let your mind drift to that accolade [no-hitter],” Greene said. “Hopefully I’m going to have a lot more opportunities for that. Looking forward to that.” Reds manager David Bell said that he will count it as a no-hitter in his mind. “At this point in his career, it’s cool to be a part of that today,” manager David Bell said. Bell sent Greene to the mound for the eighth despite 102 pitches. What a contrast to earlier this year when the Los Angeles Dodgers pulled future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw after 80 pitches with a perfect game in tact.
