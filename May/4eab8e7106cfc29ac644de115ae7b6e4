As American families deal with a shortage of baby formula across the US, a Florida Republican lawmaker has released images of dozens of boxes of the coveted product at a migrant processing facility near the US-Mexico border. Rep. Kat Cammack shared images of “pallets” of infant formula at the Ursula Migrant Processing Center in McAllen, Texas on her Twitter and Facebook pages Wednesday. “The first photo is from this morning at the Ursula Processing Center at the U.S. border. Shelves and pallets packed with baby formula,” she wrote in a tweet. “The second is from a shelf right here at home. Formula is scarce. This is what America last looks like.” Cammack’s office shared several additional images supposedly from the same location with The Post on Thursday. The Post was unable to immediately independently verify the location of the images or obtain additional information on the history and frequency of shipments, as well as the distribution of the formula. The images feature dozens of boxes of various baby formula brands, including Nido and Advantage. In one of the images, the formula appears to have just arrived after being shipped to the facility and it is marked with a “DO NOT TAKE” sign. Images of the formula on the shelves are not labeled with such a sign. Cammack was reportedly sent the images by a Border Patrol agent who has worked in his role for “30 years,” she said in a video posted to Facebook. According to Cammack’s office, the agent did not provide any details on the frequency of the shipments, but did note that the ones pictured “were just a few” of what had been received Wednesday morning. The images of the infant formula come as Americans face a nation-wide shortage stemming from a February recall.
