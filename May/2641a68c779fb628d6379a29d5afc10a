Since the rise of TikTok, many users have taken to sharing their own favorite personal recipes. Here, we explore several coffee-based tips and tricks found on TikTok. One famous coffee hack shared across TikTok helps keep iced coffee fresh for longer. Instead of filling your cold brew with water-based ice, TikTok user @katielopinski recommends freezing coffee beforehand to add to your morning drink. As the ice melts, the drink will maintain its strength and taste. Another option includes freezing whatever milk or creamer you prefer to use in your coffee. During the early Covid-19 pandemic and subsequential quarantine, one particular coffee hack began trending across TikTok: dalgona coffee. Dalgona coffee mixes instant coffee powder with sugar and hot water to achieve a whipped, frothy appearance. Milk is then added to the mixture, which can be served either hot or cold. Those who wish to try the trick but do not own a handheld blender can opt for a whisk. TikTok user @ShakyBarista teaches viewers how to make an espresso drink without having any espresso on hand. The simple trick requires a higher instant coffee to water ratio than a typical glass of coffee would take. His profile page also features additional coffee-related tips and recipes. “Proffee” is a term often found on TikTok by those turning their coffee into a meal replacement. Instead of adding creamer to your coffee, various users recommend pouring in a premade protein shake. Another option includes adding coffee to a blended morning shake. One user, @katielarimore, shows viewers how to create vegan, coffee-based ice cream at home. Soak cashews in hot water for a few hours before adding them to a blender with maple syrup and cold brew. Freeze the mixture before reblending. This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
