Manhattan’s woo-woo wellness mecca is coming to the Hamptons. The Well — known for mixing crystals, alternative medicine with more conventional approaches to mental and physical health — will open at Dune Deck Beach Club this summer. “We created a program that is like nothing else in the Hamptons, making it easy for them to get the most out of their summer,” said Kane Sarhan, a co-founder of the Well, The private beach club in Westhampton — where $1 million memberships quickly sold out after opening in 2017 — is founded by Discovery Land Company and Casamigos tequila honcho Mike Meldman. The pop-up will bring weekly movement and fitness classes and treatments such as lymph drainage, massages, cupping, collagen boosts and a brain fuel and muscle-repair vitamin IV drip to the resort. Members will also be able to book facials from the cult beauty brand Dr. Barbara Sturm and have access to “visiting masters” across eastern and western healing practices. Peter Whelan, a representative for Discovery Land Company, adds that spa and wellness are an integral part of Discovery Land Company, which is known for offering its work-hard-play-harder activities such as surfing, kayaking, kiteboarding, wakeboarding, paddle-boarding, jet skiing and fly fishing. “It’s something that our members truly care about and a priority for us,” he said “The Well pop-up makes total sense is another great amenity to add to our list this year.”
