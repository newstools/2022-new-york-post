The mother of an NYPD officer was fatally shot at her Queens home on Wednesday afternoon after answering her door – and her alleged killer surrendered to police about an hour later, authorities said. Anna Torres, 51, was shot twice, including in the head, by a gunman who drew her to the door of her two-story single-family home at 94-59 109th Ave. in Ozone Park at about 2:30 p.m., cops said. Torres was pronounced dead on scene. Two of her relatives were inside the home at the time of the fatal shooting, NYPD Deputy Chief Jerry O’Sullivan said at a Wednesday night press conference. The suspect in Torres’ death, Giuseppe Canzani, 41, fled the scene after the shooting in black Chevy Traverse. Shortly before 3:30 p.m.,Canzani pulled up to the 106th Precinct in the same vehicle before exiting and placing a .45-caliber silver firearm on the sidewalk, O’Sullivan said. Two officers outside the station house at the time arrested Canzani without incident. O’Sullivan said the suspect would be charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon. It wasn’t immediately clear what motivated Canzani to allegedly fatally shoot Torres and the relationship between the two was unknown. The incident is the first fatal shooting in the 106th Precinct this year, police statistics show. There were three prior shootings with three victims this year within the precinct boundaries.
