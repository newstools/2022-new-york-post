Ben Simmons’ sad saga continued Thursday as he underwent major disc surgery in his back, though the Brooklyn Nets claim he will be back for training camp. The Nets termed the surgery as a “microdiscectomy,” which took place in Los Angeles at Cedars-Sinai Marina Del Rey Hospital. The procedure was performed by Dr. Robert Watkins IV and the Nets said after three weeks of recovery, he will begin a rehab program. Even if he makes it back for late September’s training camp, the new surgery will keep him off the basketball court where he hasn’t been on for quite some time competitively. Simmons has not played an actual NBA game since June 2021. Though he returned to Nets practice, he never performed in a 5-on-5 scrimmage. Traded to the Nets in February in a package for James Harden, Simmons never suited up – first dealing with ongoing mental health issues and then the back soreness. He was gearing up to play in Game 4 vs. the Celtics but opted out – most likely because the Nets were down 3-0 to the Celtics and the risk outweighed the reward. The disc surgery further proves the Nets got back damaged goods in the Simmons deal. However, the Sixers aren’t soaring with Harden, who hasn’t lifted his game in the second-round series vs. the Heat with Philly trailing 2-0. Nets president Sean Marks and coach Steve Nash haven’t addressed the media since the Nets were swept by the Celtics, 4-0, in an embarrassing first-round flop.
