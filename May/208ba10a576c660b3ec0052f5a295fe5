A “sex tourism” charge could land a West Virginia man in federal prison for 30 years, authorities said Monday. Douglas Law, 60, admitted to breaking the law when he traveled overseas to have sex with an underage girl, pleading guilty to one count of “sex tourism,” the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of West Virginia announced Monday. Law had sex with a 14-year-old girl in a hotel room during a May 2019 trip to the Philippines, according to authorities. He connected with the girl through social media from his Spelter, W.Va., home and sent her money in exchange for sexually explicit videos and photos, US Attorney William Ihlenfeld said. During the plea hearing, an agent testified that Law made at least 10 trips to the Philippines from 2014 to 2019. Law said in court be believed the girl was 16, instead of 14, but an agent testified a witness contradicted that claim, according to WV News. Law could face as many as three decades behind bars and a fine of up to $250,000. Federal sentencing guidelines dictate the actual sentence will depend on the seriousness of the crime and any prior criminal history, authorities said. The Centers for Control Disease and Prevention states on its website that sex tourism “is defined as travel planned specifically for the purpose of sex, generally to a country where sex work is legal.” “Sex tourism supports human trafficking (slavery), one of the largest criminal industries in the world,” the CDC went on to state. “Even if prostitution is legal in a country, human trafficking, sex with a minor, and child pornography are ALWAYS crimes.” The Department of Homeland Security investigated the case.
