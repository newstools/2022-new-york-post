A recently paroled high-risk sex offender was arrested Thursday in connection to the brutal, knifepoint rape of a woman in a Bronx elevator this week, cops said Thursday. Level 3 offender Ramon Rotestan — who had been let out just six weeks ago after 16 years in jail — turned himself in around 8:30 p.m. at the 49th Precinct, police said. The horrifying encounter happened around 10 p.m. Monday, when Rotestan followed the woman into the building at Bolton Street and Lydig Avenue in Pelham Parkway, authorities said. The attacker trailed behind the victim as she entered the elevator, where he appeared to talk to her while displaying a knife, cops said. Surveillance video taken from inside the elevator allegedly shows Rotestan interacting with his victim — before pulling out what appears to be a condom. He then raped her and snatched $112 from her, police said. She was taken to Jacobi Medical Center for treatment, cops said. Rotestan was charged with rape and sexually motivated robbery, authorities said. He has two prior arrests for rape — one on Dec. 11, 2005, and one from Feb. 2, 2006 — and one previous bust for attempted rape on Feb. 28, 2006, according to police sources. In each of those cases, he was armed with a knife, approached his victim in an elevator, and robbed her, the sources said. “That’s his M.O.,” a police source said. He was released on parole March 30 from state prison — where he was held on rape, sexual abuse and burglary charges, records show. His parole expires in March 2027. “Our most violent prisoners are continuously being released despite being a danger to the community, all for a second chance,” a police source said. “We’re doing a disservice to the community and almost being implicit in their next crime.” Rotestan has also served time for first-degree robbery, attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, and criminal possession of a controlled substance, records show.
