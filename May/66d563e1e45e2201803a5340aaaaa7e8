Russell Wilson is over the moon for his Sports Illustrated Swimsuit “cover girl,” wife Ciara. On Monday, the same day it was revealed that the “Level Up” singer, 36, would cover the iconic magazine’s 2022 issue, along with Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk and Yumi Nu, the Broncos quarterback congratulated his favorite teammate on her major career milestone. “‘Momma! We made it!’  You are not only the most beautiful woman in the world, but your heart, your kindness, your love for others, your ability to make the world dance, your a big time CEO, an incredible wife and mother! You Inspire me! There is nothing you can’t do! Worth more than Gold! I love you baby!” Wilson posted on Instagram, re-sharing Ciara’s cover with his 5.4 million followers. Ciara is seen wearing a leopard print one-piece by LaQuan Smith in her cover shot, which was taken by photographer Ben Watts in Barbados. The mother of three told the publication that being on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue is a lifelong dream come true. “I’ve always dreamt of being on this cover ever since I was really young and especially as an entertainer,” Ciara said, noting how she admired fellow Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star, Tyra Banks. “It’s always been pretty significant in the entertainment space. It’s a big dream come true for me, and it was a special day when I got the call,” she said. This year has been quite life-changing for both Ciara and Wilson, 33. Back in March, the nine-time Pro Bowler was traded to the Broncos after spending the entirety of his NFL career thus far with the Seahawks. Ciara and Wilson have been married since 2016 and share daughter Sienna Princess, 5, and son Win Harrison, 1. The singer also has a 7-year-old son, Future Zahir, with her ex, rapper Future.
