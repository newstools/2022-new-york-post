A US Navy sailor in the city for Fleet Week was punched in the face by a man claiming to be a Marine during a brawl on the Lower East Side early Sunday morning, police sources said. The 24-year-old seaman, who was in town from New Mexico, got into a fight with a man who told him he was a US Marine at the corner of Montgomery Street and South Street at around 2:30 a.m., according to the sources. The sailor was struck in the face and had his head pushed into the pavement, the sources said. He refused medical attention for a cut and returned to his ship. There were no immediate arrests. The sailor may have been intoxicated, a police source said. The Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard returned to the city for Fleet Week from May 25–31 for the first time in two years after the annual event was scuttled by the COVID-19 pandemic.
