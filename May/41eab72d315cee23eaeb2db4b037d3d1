It looks like another Yankee could be heading to the injured list. Giancarlo Stanton left the Yankees’ 7-6, 11-inning win over the Orioles at the Stadium with right calf tightness, the team announced. Stanton, who was the designated hitter, was pinch hit for by Estevan Florial in the seventh inning. He will undergo an MRI exam on Wednesday Stanton may be joining a list of Yankees, who are on the IL or COVID lists. Some of the key Yankees who are out include: Aroldis Chapman (15-day IL Achilles tendinitis), Chad Green (season-ending Tommy John surgery) and Joey Gallo, Kyle Higashioka (activated today) and Josh Donaldson (COVID-19 list, one-game suspension).
