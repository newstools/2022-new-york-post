The Celtics welcome the Bucks to Boston for a pivotal Game 5 and Joe Dellera of The Action Network is here to share his favorite player prop bets for the contest (video above). For his first prop play, Dellera is looking to the Boston side, specifically center Al Horford. As for his prop play, he’s backing Horford 2+ three-pointers made. Al Horford 2+ three-pointers made (FanDuel) Dellera’s thesis around Horford centers around his heavy minutes and penchant for clearing this benchmark. “Across this series…Horford is averaging 3.5 makes on an average of seven attempts,” Dellera says. Horford has also notched at least three three-pointers made in three of the first four games this series. Plus, Horford is playing 36.4 minutes per game this series and has demonstrated an ability to hit this mark when playing 30 or more minutes.  In six such games, Horford has notched at least three three-pointers in four contests. Add in the Bucks welcome these shots from Horford and Dellera believes this prop carries value. As for his second pick, Dellera is backing Bucks center Brook Lopez over 17.5 points + rebounds + assists -125 (FanDuel). Although Lopez has recorded an assist in eight of his last 22 games, he’s done well to clear this mark just on points and rebounds. “[Lopez] has gone over this in two straight just on points and rebounds,” Dellera says. Given the value, Lopez provides for the Bucks — length on the defensive end and an ability to stretch the floor offensively — Dellera believes the minutes will be there to clear this number for a third straight game
