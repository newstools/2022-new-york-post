A 13-year-old and 14-year-old were shot outside Central Park on Saturday evening, police and sources said. The shooting happened just before 5 p.m. near 110th Street and 5th Avenue in Harlem adjacent to the park’s northeast corner, police said. There were two groups of teenagers hanging out on opposite sides of 5th Avenue when shots rang out, according to law enforcement sources. It’s not clear whether the wounded teenagers were on the same side or opposite sides of the street. The 13-year-old was shot in the right leg and 14-year-old was hit in the left bicep and received a graze wound to his stomach, the sources said. Both victims were transported to Harlem Hospital for non-life threatening injuries, cops said. No suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made, cops said. Five 9mm shell casings were recovered at the scene, sources said.
