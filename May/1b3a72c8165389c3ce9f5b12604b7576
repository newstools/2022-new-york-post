A woman shared that she was once stood up by a bloke she met on Tinder but she got the best revenge. TikToker Stine said that every now and again she will still message him asking if he’s on his way. She explained her tactic in a hilarious video uploaded to her account. She said: “Thinking about how I got stood up by a Tinder date a year ago and I still snap him every now and again saying ‘hey are you on your way?” The influencer added: “The best part is he just plays along and is like ‘yeah sorry I’m running late I’ll be right there’.” The hilarious clip has now racked up more than 1.4million views and almost 200k likes from fellow TikTokers. In a follow up video she said: “The messages would always be as video messages of us talking back and forth. “But I did save some of the videos that I’ve sent him, I just don’t have any of his replied.  “He would be like: ‘Oh my flight was delayed, I’ll be there soon’ or ‘sorry, I got caught up, I’ll be there’.” Fellow TikTokers were quick to comment of the hilarious story. One person said: “The fact that his replies would make me actually want him to show up.” Another said: “The ultimate is one time he DOES show up and just says ‘hey, so sorry I’m late’.” A third said: “Plot twist – he is on the way. He’s been lost for a year. While others had their own stories of waiting for someone who’s not showing up. One person said: “I met a boy at the mall when I was 17 and got his number. We were texting and he said ‘brb’. Im 25 and sometimes my friends randomly ask if he’s come back.” Another said: “This girl at work left on break and never came back and every now and then I’d tell the supervisor she still not back from break?” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
