A glamorous woman showed off her stunning style before showing herself looking very different without make-up and joking that the dolled-up look “just wasn’t her”. TikToker Julia Grandoni often jokes about the dramatic difference between her looks when made-up and au natural. She shared the funny clip to social media comparing the two looks. She captioned the short video with: “Wow you’re so pretty!!” Alongside a high glam picture of herself with a full face of make-up, long sleek hair and a eye-catching little black dress. In the next frame she showed her face, make-up free and from an unflattering chin angle. She mouthed: “That just ain’t me” to the camera. Fellow TikTokers were blown away by the transformation. One person said: “I’m literally obsessed with this trend. We’re actually shape shifters.” Another said: “My makeup doesn’t do that.” A third said: “This is what girls growing up need to see to understand that it’s okay if you don’t look like that.” While another said: “I feel so normal and wholesome and good thank you.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
