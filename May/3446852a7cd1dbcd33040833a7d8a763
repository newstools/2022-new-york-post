Jarred Kelenic will make his Citi Field debut this weekend. And with him still hitting below the Mendoza Line in his short career, it’s possible the blockbuster trade that sent the former Mets first-round pick to the Mariners before the 2019 season wasn’t as lopsided in Seattle’s favor as it has often appeared. That debate won’t be settled immediately. Kelenic is just 22, and the Mets are only now receiving their best version of Edwin Diaz. The other key component of that deal, Robinson Cano, was recently released by the Mets, but is still owed about $37 million by the club. Less mentioned is a deal that could look even worse than the Kelenic trade in that the Mets have almost nothing left to show for it. The trade happened last July, when the Mets sent their 2020 first-round pick, Pete Crow-Armstrong, to the Cubs for Javier Baez and Trevor Williams. Crow-Armstrong, who missed most of last season after undergoing shoulder surgery, is enjoying a fast start for Single-A Myrtle Beach in the Carolina League. In his first 24 games, he owned a .378/.470/.561 slash line with four homers, 18 RBIs and eight stolen bases. Yes, it’s early, and yes, it’s only A-ball. But the 20-year-old Crow-Armstrong’s development will be worth watching.
