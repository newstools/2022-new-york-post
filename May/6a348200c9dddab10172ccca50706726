Jethro Lazenby, the son of Bad Seeds frontman Nick Cave, has died. He was 31. Cave, 64, confirmed his son’s passing to NME on Monday in a statement: “With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away.” “We would be grateful for family privacy at this time,” he added. No cause of death for Lazenby has been revealed yet. He moonlighted as an actor, photographer and model, and also went by the name Jethro Cave. He had been imprisoned earlier this year after assaulting his mother, Beau Lazenby, in Melbourne, Australia, the Guardian reported. Lazenby was born in Melbourne in 1991 and found out that the Australian musician was his father when he was 8 years old. He has appeared in projects such as 2007’s “Corroboree” and “My Little Princess” in 2011. Cave’s son with Susie Bick, Arthur, died in 2015 after he fell from a cliff in Brighton, England. He was only 15 years old. The coroner noted at the time that Arthur’s death was accidental and that he had taken LSD shortly before his death.
