The grandson of former Staten Island president James Molinaro has been charged with attempted murder after he was busted with 100 pounds of pot following a shooting last week, police said. The charges were upgraded against Steven Molinaro, 33, on Thursday and he was expected to appear in court later in the day, authorities said. Molinaro was arrested on April 27 after cops were called to a Staten Island building at 89 Lyman Ave. over reports of a shooting. When cops arrived, they found a wounded 21-year-old woman, who is believed to be Molinaro’s girlfriend, and a stash of marijuana, cops said. The woman was shot in the chest and was taken to the hospital where she was in critical but stable condition. A 9mm pistol was found nearby. Almir Ramic, 34, who also lives in the building was arrested with Molinaro and faces similar drug charges, cops said.
