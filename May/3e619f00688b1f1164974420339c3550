Former Mr. Universe Calum von Moger has been left fighting for his life after jumping through a window, it has been reported. The Australian actor and bodybuilder, 31, is said to have plunged from a second storey window last week. Moger is best known for his portrayal of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 2018 film Bigger. According to Generation Iron, Moger seriously injured his spine in the fall on May 6 and underwent a major operation. Fellow bodybuilder and Youtuber Nick Trigilli said the three-time Mr. Universe winner was still in hospital in an induced coma. Trigilli claimed he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident. Moger, who has 3.2 million Instagram followers, suffered a large number of cuts from the glass, according to reports. Trigilli, who runs the BodyBuilding & BS YouTube channel, said in his video: “Calum is hitting a rough spot… I hope this is rock bottom for him and he can get his life back.” According to reports, Moger was recently kicked out of his family’s house in Australia. In an emotional post on Instagram last week, he said: “Everyone has a past. We’ve all been through hard times. I admit, I messed up bad many times. “But I don’t care about dwelling on negative thoughts of the past. All I care about is that I learn from my mistakes and become a better person. “The positive achievements I’ve done in my life far outweigh the muck-ups I had along the way. “All I can ask is for your forgiveness so I can keep moving forward on the right path again.” Fans rushed to send messages of support after learning about Moger’s injury. One said: “Praying for you man. You were my first inspiration with fitness and I’m hoping you get through these hard times.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
