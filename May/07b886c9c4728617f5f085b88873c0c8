Dozen of vehicles — including nine belonging to city firefighters and US Secret Service members — had their tires slashed in Manhattan overnight, police said. The smoke-eaters had parked their personal cars, with FDNY placards in the windows, near their stationhouse at 782 Eighth Ave. in Times Square and found their tires slashed Tuesday morning, according to cops. Two US Secret Service members Tuesday also reported their tires cut after parking on East 56 Street between Madison and Park avenues with federal-government parking plaques, cops said. In addition, police received 20 other reports of slashed tires Tuesday morning on West 15th Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues  and another five on Eighth Avenue between West 17th and West 22nd streets in Chelsea. It was unclear if the incidents were connected.
