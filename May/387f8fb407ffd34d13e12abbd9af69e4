They grow up so fast. LeBron James’ eldest son Bronny attended his high school prom last weekend at Sierra Canyon School in Los Angeles, where the 17-year-old basketball prodigy arrived in a luxury sports car. The star point guard — who, like his dad, has already covered Sports Illustrated — was dressed to the nines in a blue and black suit with velvet shoes. Bronny’s date was dressed to impress in a strapless white dress, which featured a plunging neckline and feathered leg slit. His mother, Savannah James, shared a number of photos to Instagram, and was admittedly emotional over the milestone event. “Sooooo @bronny went to prom this past weekend….. Tons of emotions and realizations,” she wrote in her caption. “Time really flies.  So proud of you young man!! I will always have your front and your back!! Zhuri is processing all of this too!!  (Last slide).” The last photo in the collage included the youngest of the James kids, 7-year-old Zhuri, who sported a poker face in a photo that showed her brother posing with his prom date. “Zhuri ain’t fkn around! She don’t play about her brothers!! ,” James wrote in the comments, which included sweet messages from family friends, La La Anthony and Adrienne Bosh. Bronny is currently in his junior year at Sierra Canyon, where the point guard is focused on his playing career. He is the 54th-ranked college prospect as of April, according to 247Sports.com. The teenager will be draft eligible in two years under the NBA’s current rules, which require incoming players to be at least 19 years old and at least one year removed from graduating high school. James has long said he wants to play alongside his son in the NBA and discussed the possibility in a recent Twitter Q&A with fans amid his offseason — which started in April after the Lakers failed to the make the playoffs. When asked if he “100% plans on playing with Bronny,” the four-time NBA champion, James said, “That’s the plan! God willing.”
