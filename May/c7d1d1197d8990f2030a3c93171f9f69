An age-defying mom of three has revealed her top secrets to looking young. Kim Macgregor took to TikTok and shared a snap where she’s seen showing off her svelte figure and toned abs as she poses against a beach hut in a bikini. Alongside the photo, she writes: “53-years-old, three daughters, six years post menopause.” And luckily for her social media followers, she then went on to share her secrets on how anyone can “look and feel their best.” And perhaps best of all? They’re super easy! In a short clip, she’s seen lifting in the gym, before recommending working out 3-5 times a week and advising to “lift weights.” She then rustles up a healthy-looking drink in her kitchen and urges: “Focus on gut health with clean supplements.” And it wasn’t long before the comments section was flooded with compliments for the 53-year-old fitness enthusiast. “Thought you were Heidi Klum!” enthused one. A second praised: “You look incredible.” A third added: “Yes but it consumes your life now to the point you can’t relax and just be happy.” Kim responded: “Happiest I’ve ever been. All that hard work is paying off.” Meanwhile, a fourth quipped: “Holy sh!@ girl!! My new idol!” Another branded her “gorgeous” while a further told how they admired Kim for her “dedication and hard work.” Someone else added: “The hair is gorgeous!! better than a 29 year olds!!” Sharing her secret, Kim replied: “It’s a vegan collagen skin elixir and vegan hair care. Makes a difference. Elsewhere, one social media wrote: “Genetics play an important role and it’s obvious you have great genetics.” But Kim defended her hard work and quipped: “Thanks but wouldn’t carry me very far without a healthy lifestyle.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
