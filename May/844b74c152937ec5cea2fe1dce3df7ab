Only one thing is putting a damper on Paige Spiranac’s Bahamas golf trip. The golf personality opened up about recent struggles with the yips — when golfers suddenly develop a hitch in their swing that causes mis-hits — during a golf outing at the Royal Blue Golf Club. “A little Bahamas golf I’ll be honest, my game is really struggling right now,” Spiranac captioned a post Instagram Tuesday, that featured the former pro on the course dressed in a hot pink golf dress. “Today I got the yips off the tee which was the first time that’s happened since playing pro. I was pretty discouraged and have been down on myself about my golf game. I know we can all feel this way sometimes so I want to take you along with me as I work on my game. So more stories with practice plans and we will go through my @shot_scope stats together! Let’s make this a team effort. A support group for bad golf lol.” Spiranac went on to ask her 3 million-plus Instagram followers, “What’s one thing you want to improve on this summer with your game?” On Monday, the PointsBet ambassador seemed to hint that she had a rough day on the golf course in a tweet that read, “Today I threw my driver 40 yards in the air. Hit a cart path and bounced into the s–t. Not one scratch on the club head. That TM Stealth driver is indestructible. Pretty impressive.” Spiranac’s golf struggles haven’t slowed down the social media star. She recently participated in mock NFL combine drills with the sportsbook ahead of the 2022 NFL Draft and put up some impressive numbers — and trolled Patriots quarterback Mac Jones in the process. Spiranac completed one “rep” on the bench press and said, “Did I just beat Mac Jones?” She recorded a 19-inch vertical leap, completed the 20-yard-dash in 2.97 seconds and then the short shuttle in 5.5 seconds.
