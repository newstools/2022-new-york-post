An orphaned daughter of Irma Garcia — the slain Texas teacher whose husband died of heartbreak two days later — has penned a moving tribute, saying her late parents’ names will never be forgotten. Lyliana, 15, added the emotional message at the weekend on a cross for dad Jose Garcia, 50, that was added to the growing memorial to the 19 children and two teachers killed in Uvalde, photos in The Mirror show. “Dad, I know this was too much for you. Your heart could not take it,” Lyliana, one of the Garcias’ four children, wrote of her dad, who died of a heart attack hours after he’d left flowers at the same memorial. “I will spend the rest of my life fighting for you and mom. Your names will not be forgotten,” she wrote, signing it with a small heart and, “Your daughter, Lyliana.” Irma Garcia, 48, was gunned down alongside fellow fourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles, 44, and 19 of their students last Tuesday when demented 18-year-old gunman Salvador Ramos stormed Robb Elementary School. Her husband died two days later, when he “joined the love of his life and was also welcomed into the arms of his wife, Irma,” an online obituary says. “They began their relationship in high school and it flourished into a love that was beautiful and kind,” said the obituary of the couple who had been married for 25 years. The couple had four children: Cristian, 23, Jose, 19, Alysandra, 13, and Lyliana. They will be buried together following a private ceremony at Uvalde’s Sacred Heart Church, according to The Mirror.
