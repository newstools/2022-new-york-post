Jeremy Ruckert’s dad might be more excited about his son joining the Jets than even the tight end himself. Ruckert, an Ohio State product and lifelong fan of the green and white, officially signed his rookie contract with the Jets on Monday — and a now viral clip shows his dad leading a “J-E-T-S” chant as he put the pen to paper. Ruckert’s dad was all smiles, dressed in a green Jets t-shirt, while pumping his arms behind his son, who the Jets took in the third-round of the 2022 NFL Draft in April. “Pen to paper!” Ruckert wrote on Instagram, including photos from the moment he signed his contact. “This is just the beginning, I’m officially a New York Jet! LET’S GO.” Ruckert’s dad went viral for his excited reaction to the Jets drafting his son last month. After letting out an emotional scream and hugging Jeremy, he led friends and family in a “J-E-T-S” chant. Ruckert grew up on Long Island and became a Jets fan when the team trained at Hofstra University in Hempstead. He would make trips from Lindenhurst with his parents to the area around Weeb Ewbank Hall to watch the team practice. He also worked under Jets head coach Robert Saleh and TE Coach Ron Middleton at the Senior Bowl in February. Saleh said earlier this month the hope is that Ruckert will be available to get some work in this spring, as the tight end has been dealing with a foot injury. The Jets also signed two veterans at tight end in C.J. Uzomah and Tyler Conklin, both of whom Ruckert has expressed his excitement to play with. Ruckert had 54 catches for 615 yards and 12 TDs across four seasons at Ohio State.
