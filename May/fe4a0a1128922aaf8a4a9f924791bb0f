Amber Heard snapped disturbing photos of Johnny Depp passed out after drug and alcohol binges because nobody believed that he had an addiction problem, the actress said in court Thursday. Four stunning photographs submitted to the Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia appear to show the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star unconscious in chairs and on a hotel room floor, Heard said during the ex-couple’s explosive defamation trial. “He’d pass out, get sick, lose control of himself. People would pick him up and clean it and fix it,” Heard said on her second day on the stand. “He wouldn’t either remember, or he would deny it, or he would accuse me of saying that this had happened when it didn’t. And there was no one to back me up,” she said. “[It was] just him, his employees, and everyone who had been taking care of him versus my word, and so I started to take pictures [to] say, ‘Look, this is happening,'” she said. One of the images shows the inert actor curled up under a painting in a swanky Tokyo hotel room during a press tour for “The Lone Ranger” in 2013, Heard said. “He was drinking at the restaurant and the [people on the press tour] were kind of noticing, but not really sure what to make of it … Johnny became upset with me for judging him,” she said of the incident. “Johnny screamed at me and all I could think was they were in the next hotel room.” Other images show Depp zonked out in a lawn chair, passed out while on vacation and while on a bender, Heard said. The 36-year-old actress testified that Depp would sometimes  “nod out” or fall asleep “mid-conversation” after taking opiates and that he was abusive while on drugs. Earlier in the trial, Depp, 58,  insisted that the Tokyo hotel image simply showed him sleeping — though he’s dozing on the floor next to a bed. Depp is suing Heard, his ex-wife, in a $50 million defamation suit over a 2018 op-ed in the Washington Post in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse.”
