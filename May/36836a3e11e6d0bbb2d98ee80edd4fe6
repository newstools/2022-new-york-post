An active shooter was reported at a Texas elementary school Tuesday afternoon after “gunshots” were reported in the area, the school announced. Robb Elementary School, located in Uvalde, about 60 miles east of the southern border of Mexico and about 80 miles west of San Antonio, placed the school on lockdown around 11:43 a.m. local time after gunshots were heard in the area, they wrote on Facebook. About a half-hour later, the school reported there was now an “active shooter” at the school. The Uvalde Police Department confirmed on Facebook the shooter was in police custody at 1:06 p.m. Police officials couldn’t immediately be reached for further details about the incident and it’s not clear if there are any injuries. “Your cooperation is needed at this time by not visiting the campus. As soon as more information is gathered it will be shared,” the school wrote. “The rest of the district is under a Secure Status.” A reunification site for students has been set up at the Willie DeLeon Civic Center but the school asked parents not to come to the location until all pupils are accounted for. “You will be notified to pick up students once all are accounted for,” the school wrote.
