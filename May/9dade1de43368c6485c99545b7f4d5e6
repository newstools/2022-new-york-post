Hail Mary, these red panties were a mistake! Administrators at a Philadelphia Catholic school are repenting after accidentally selling kinky underwear that was disguised to look like red roses. St. Anselm  — which teaches students from Pre-K through Grade 8 — held a Mother’s Day plant sale last week so that pupils could purchase flowers for the matriarchs in their lives. However, officials failed to realize that the roses they were selling were actually bunched-up red thongs intended to be given as sexy Valentine’s Day gifts. Video shot by mom Rachel Tremblay last Friday went viral after it showed her husband opening up the “rose” her young daughter received through the Pennsylvania school. “Just open it!” Tremblay declared in the clip as her spouse picked at the item. “Oh my God!” he exclaimed as he pulled out the raunchy red garment and held it up to the camera. “That’s hilarious!” Tremblay also saw the funny side of the blunder, cackling on camera before exclaiming: “Thank you St. Anselm’s!” In the days since, the video has racked up thousands of views on Facebook, prompting hilarious comments from viewers. “I’m so mad my daughter didn’t get me one,” one mom joked. “I ended up with a rock painted like a ladybug. How inconsiderate of her!” However, not everyone was amused by the embarrassing episode, and the school was forced to send out an email to concerned parents. “The roses sold at our Mother’s Day plant sale were not the single faux flowers originally intended,” the school’s principal wrote in an email, obtained by CBS Philly. “Instead, the item was a Valentine’s Day gift intended for adults. The administration will determine how the error occurred and take steps to prevent a further recurrence.”
