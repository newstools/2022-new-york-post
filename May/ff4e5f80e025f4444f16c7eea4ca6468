Sleeping with someone for the first time is such an intimate experience as you allow them to see you in the most vulnerable state. Sadly, one woman was actually body-shamed for how she chooses to groom herself. An unnamed woman took to social media to call out the man she had been seeing for criticizing her body. In the texts, he told her: “Hey, this isn’t going to work. “You’re sexy and funny but seeing your hairy armpits is a no-go, it’s just my preference.” Immediately, she clapped back and said: “So you having armpits is fine, but not me, a woman who also grows hair there?” “It’s just my preference,” he simply responded. But she wasn’t going to take it. The woman then slammed him: “But you have a d**k shaped like a croissant isn’t my preference, but I understand that it’s not something you can help. “So here we are.” The man was taken aback by her comment and simply told her that he was being open with her before calling her a “b**ch.” Following her video, many women actually stood up for her and agreed that his reasons were simply sexist. “The point is that his preference is rooted in sexism,” one person wrote. A second added: “Dodged a bullet, girl, that’s middle school energy.” And a third analyzed: “He was absolutely looking for an excuse to break up like that’s such a small thing to leave someone over.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
