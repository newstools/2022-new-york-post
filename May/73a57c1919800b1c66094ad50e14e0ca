Chicago police are searching for an unidentified man who appeared to point a firearm at a TV news crew on Wednesday while it was airing a live broadcast about gun violence. The frightening incident took place during Fox 32-TV’s morning newscast “Good Morning Chicago.” Joanie Lum was reporting about gun violence live on the air from the corner of Clark and Hubbard in the River North section of the city at around 7 a.m. when a man wearing a coat with a hood walked past just a few feet behind her. While looking into the camera, the man then took out what appeared to be a handgun and pointed it at the news crew. Chicago police consider the man a “person of interest” and are searching for him, the news station reported. Alarmed viewers phoned into the television station and expressed their concern. “Thank you to the viewers who were watching Good Day Chicago and called or emailed to make sure our crew was okay,” according to the station. Chicago, the nation’s third largest city, has been plagued by gang-fueled gun violence. Last week, two people were killed and seven were wounded in a mass shooting near the city’s famed Magnificent Mile. Law enforcement officials said a “personal conflict” sparked the shooting. Shootings in downtown Chicago are up significantly this year, the Sun-Times reported — including a 225% jump in the district where last Thursday’s gunfire erupted and 100% in the city’s 1st District, which includes parts of downtown and the Loop. The nation has been in shock in recent days following Tuesday’s mass shooting at a Texas elementary school. An 18-year-old, Salvador Ramos, is alleged to have used an assault rifle to mow down classmates and teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Nineteen children and two adults were killed, according to authorities.
