When Rangers manager Chris Woodward called Yankee Stadium a “Little League ballpark” on Sunday afternoon and claimed Gleyber Torres’ walk-off home run would have been “an easy out in 99 percent of ballparks,” there was only one place to turn for the cold, hard truth: The “Would it dong?” Twitter account. Across the country, a warehouse manager for a small company in Washington got a heads-up on his personal Twitter account that he should check out the pet project he created last year. Dan Morse quickly realized it was going to be a big day for “Would it dong?” The Twitter bot pulls data from MLB’s Statcast and compares it against ballpark dimensions to measure how many stadiums in which a fly ball would be a home run.
