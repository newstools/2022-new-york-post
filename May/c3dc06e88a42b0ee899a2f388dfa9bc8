Taping for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” has stopped until “further notice” as the talk show host is “experiencing symptoms consistent with a recurrence of COVID,” according to a tweet from the show’s account posted Monday afternoon. Colbert previously tested positive for the coronavirus less than a month ago, according to a tweet from April 21. At that time, he wrote that he was “basically fine,” thanks to being vaccinated, and joked, “This just proves that I will do anything to avoid interviewing Jason Bateman,” a reference to a planned interview that night with the popular “Ozark” star. On Monday, the political funnyman again made light of his positive test, tweeting, “WORST. SEQUEL. EVER.” Monday’s announcement indicated that Colbert — whose show airs on CBS — would be “isolating for a few additional days.” Fellow late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel also recently missed taping his ABC series after contracting the virus. Comedian Mike Birbiglia, 43, temporarily took over hosting duties for the 54-year-old, and included a conversation with Kevin Hart about the aftermath of a man attacking Dave Chappelle onstage recently at the Hollywood Bowl.
