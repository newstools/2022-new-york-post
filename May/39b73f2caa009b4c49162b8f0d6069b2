The Targaryens have arrived, with fire and blood. HBO has released the official teaser trailer for its “Game of Thrones” prequel series, “House of the Dragon.” Based on the book “Fire & Blood” by George R. R. Martin and set around 200 years before the events of “Game of Thrones,” the show will star Matt Smith (“The Crown,” “Doctor Who”) and follow the squabbling, silver-haired, and incestuous members of House Targaryen, a k a Daenerys and Jon Snow’s ancestors. So, yes, there will be dragons. The trailer begins with an ominous voice narrating, “What is this brief mortal life, if not the pursuit of legacy?” We then see images of a dragon flying over a city, and we get a name-drop of a Stark ancestor, Rickon, as he enters the throne room and bows to the king. At the beginning of this story, King Viserys (Paddy Considine) reigns while Princess Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) is his named heir. Prince Daemon (Matt Smith) is her uncle, looking shifty-eyed in the trailer. A woman’s voice in the trailer says, “Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the iron throne.” So, there’s an attempt at feminism, but this is just squeezing lemon juice in the cut for “Game of Thrones” fans who liked Daenerys — since we know that even 200 years later, a woman is still not on the throne, and instead, boring Bran is. But, that’s neither here nor there. The trailer also mentions politics as an “ugly game” to “win” and sets up the squabble for the throne, with lots of shots of dark castle halls, sweeping seaside cityscapes and swords being drawn — and of course, dragons and dragon eggs. So, it’s leaning into a lot of “Game of Thrones” themes and similar visuals. “History does not remember blood, it remembers names,” the narrator concludes. “House of the Dragon” will premiere on Aug. 21 on HBO Max.
