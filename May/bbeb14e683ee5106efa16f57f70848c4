One runner died Saturday morning after finishing the Brooklyn Half Marathon, authorities said The 30-year-old man, who was not identified, possibly suffered cardiac arrest around 9 a.m. and was taken to Coney Island Hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to the NYPD. The runner collapsed after finishing the race, according to the New York Road Runners club which held the event. The runner fell on the boardwalk, a source said. The race, which took the 22,000 runners from the Brooklyn Museum through Prospect Park to the Coney Island boardwalk, was held under unseasonably warm conditions. The temperature at 9 a.m. at Coney Island was already 70 degrees with 83% humidity, according to Fox Weather. One police officer said four other people collapsed near the end. “Maybe an organizer or health official should have called it,” the cop said. The FDNY said 16 people were taken to the hospital including five with serious injuries. New York Road Runners said it had “medical staff placed from start to finish throughout the race course, who are ready to respond immediately to the medical needs of all runners, spectators, volunteers and staff.” “The health and safety of our runners, volunteers, partners, and staff remain the top priority for NYRR. In coordination and consultation with the city agency partners and weather experts, NYRR was closely monitoring weather conditions leading up to and during the race,” the group said in a statement. The event was held in person for the first time since the pandemic started. Celebrities including NBC’s “Today” weatherman Al Roker, “Good Morning America” anchor T.J. Holmes and “Bachelorette” alum Zac Clark were expected to participate. Additional reporting by Eileen A.J. Connolly and Larry Celona
