A 32-year-old pervert was busted Friday for molesting a 13-year-old boy on the child’s way home from school in Brooklyn, cops said. Christopher Fiesco was nabbed around 5 a.m. in connection to the Monday assault on the teen, police said. The boy was walking at Rockaway Parkway near Winthrop Street in Brownsville around 3:50 p.m. Monday when Fiesco stopped him and started chatting him up, cops said. Fiesco claimed he had a knife and lured the boy to “an unknown location,” where he then sexually assaulted him, police said. The teen – who did not report any injuries – was taken to a local hospital for an evaluation, cops said. Investigators tracked down Fiesco with the help of the boy, police said. The suspect was charged with luring a child to commit a felony, criminal sex act and sexual contact with an individual less than 14 years old, cops said.
