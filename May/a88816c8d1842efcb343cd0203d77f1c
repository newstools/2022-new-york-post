The teenaged boy charged in the slaying of 10-year-old Lily Peters lured her off a hiking trail into a wooded area in Wisconsin where he allegedly killed her — before returning to the crime scene to better hide her body, new court docs say. The 14-year-old suspect told police that he had been riding his hoverboard beside Lily along a trail with the intention of sexually assaulting and killing her late last month, according to a criminal complaint released Friday. He asked Lily to leave the trail with him to explore the woods, and proceeded to assault her, the complaint said. He “became scared” and left the scene, but later returned to cover the girl’s body with leaves. Lily was reported missing on April 24 after she failed to return from visiting her aunt’s house in Chippewa Falls. Searchers found her body the next morning. Authorities confirmed in a preliminary autopsy that she died from blunt force trauma and strangulation. A final report is expected within 4-6 weeks after toxicology testing is complete. The alleged killer was arrested April 27 and charged with first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree sexual assault and first-degree sexual assault of a child under age 13 in the death of Illiana “Lily” Peters. The boy remains in custody on a $1 million bond. He will be tried as an adult, however, his attorneys could request the judge move the case to juvenile court. He’s expected to appear in court next on June 24. With Post Wires
