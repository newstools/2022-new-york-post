New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has tapped Rep. Antonio Delgado to be her second-in-command, replacing disgraced ex-Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin. “I am proud to appoint Antonio Delgado, an outstanding leader and public servant, as lieutenant governor of New York, and I look forward to working with him to usher in a new era of fairness, equity, and prosperity for communities across the state,” Hochul said. “We share a belief in working together to get things done for New Yorkers, and Representative Delgado has an incredible record of doing just that in Congress. With Antonio Delgado by my side serving as lieutenant governor, we will both make history — and make a difference,” Hochul said in a press release. Delgado will also be her running mate in the upcoming Democratic primary, scheduled for June. “I am honored to serve as the New York Democratic Party’s nominee for lieutenant governor,” Delgado said in a press release from the Hochul campaign. “I was born and raised in New York on the values of hard work, discipline, and passion for service and am incredibly proud to have the opportunity to represent this great state and get things done for New Yorkers.”” The announcement comes the day after Albany Democrats passed legislation that would allow Benjamin to remove himself from the June primary ballot following his arrest on federal corruption charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Hochul signed the bill into law, which will allow Democrats to name a new preferred candidate for lieutenant governor, last night. The two-term congressman was locked in what looked to be a tight battle for re-election this year against Republican Marc Molinaro before his selection as Hochul’s new number two.
