The idea that Drew Brees could be released from his NBC contract and end up at Fox Sports is a possibility as Fox figures out its NFL booths in the aftermath of the departures of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Let’s be clear: The Brees move is on Fox’s drawing board, but it is not definitely happening. The possibility of a deal is buoyed by the fact NBC and Fox have worked closely on the USFL and other projects. That said, Fox, which has been patient in the process, still needs to indicate this is its plan. If Fox goes this route, it could potentially try to move fast. So if a full pursuit does occur, let’s take a look at what Fox, NBC and Brees must consider. Kevin Burkhardt is replacing Buck, as we have reported. Fox pursued Greg Olsen for years, nurtured his development and came away impressed with his rookie year on the No. 2 team with Burkhardt. In a perfect world, Fox would have liked Olsen to have at least one more year under his belt before being elevated to calling two of the next three Super Bowls.
