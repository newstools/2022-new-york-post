Zach Wilson’s second season with the Jets won’t get off to an easy start. The Jets will open the 2022 NFL season against the Ravens at MetLife Stadium, according to sources. That means the Jets likely will see 2019 league MVP Lamar Jackson and the always-tough Ravens to get things started. The Jets have not won a season opener since 2018 when they defeated the Lions. That is also the last time they won a game in September. The Ravens finished 8-9 last season, missing the playoffs for the first time in four years. The team was hit hard by injuries, notably to Jackson, and is expected to be better in 2022. The team made a big move on draft night when it traded away wide receiver Marquise “Hollywood” Brown. The game will be the first chance Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley faces his former team. He was injured when the two teams played in 2019. The full schedule will be officially released by the NFL on Thursday night. Sources said the Jets have one primetime game on the 2022 schedule. They will face the Jaguars at MetLife Stadium on “Thursday Night Football” on Dec. 22 in Week 16, according to sources. This will be the second meeting between Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Wilson, the top two picks in the 2021 NFL Draft. The Jets beat the Jaguars last year in Week 16.
