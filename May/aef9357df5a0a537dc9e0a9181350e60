One person was shot dead and a second was critically injured when gunfire erupted following a high school graduation in Tennessee Wednesday night, police said. A gunman opened fire outside a stadium at Middle Tennessee State University where 450 Riverdale High School grads and their families were celebrating their graduation day, Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Dan Goodwin said in a press conference streamed by WKRN. Law enforcement officials said shots rang out just before 9 p.m. as people were leaving the ceremony. The two victims were shot near the tennis court on campus. One was pronounced dead at the scene, while the second was rushed to the hospital in critical, but stable condition, authorities said. The shooting quickly turned the celebratory day into a nightmare for those in attendance as some were seen rushing away from the venue while emergency responders arrived, according to footage tweeted by posted to Twitter by NewsChannel 5 reporter Jason Lamb. The identities of the two victims have not been released and it’s unknown if either were students or graduates. The suspect is still at large and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said at the news conference. Riverdale High School will be closed tomorrow as a precaution, a spokesperson for Rutherford County Schools said.
