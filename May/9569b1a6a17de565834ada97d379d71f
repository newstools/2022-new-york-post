Richard Gere is officially unloading his longtime home. The leading man has scored a buyer to his 50-acre upstate New York property seven months after it first hit the market. Initially listing the Pound Ridge estate for $28 million in October, the home went into contract on Wednesday, according to Mansion Global. Gere, 72, purchased the land for $1.51 million back in 1986. And as of Thursday, the spread is in contract. “One of the great American family compounds one hour to New York City,” the previous listing stated. “This magical country compound, expertly meshed into the landscape, comprises nearly 50 acres all buffered from the outside world by over 4,300 acres of protected land to create a peaceful and playful refuge with natural beauty at its core.” Amenities include a private lake with a sandy beach and an island to row out to, rolling hills for horseback riding, a hidden soccer field surrounded by weeping willow trees and gardens. The estate also boasts five structures including horse stables, a pool house, and guest house. The main residence has eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, spanning over 11,600 square feet. Muffin Dowdle with Ginnel Real Estate held the listing. The move to sell the Pound Ridge residence Gere called home for 35 years comes after he purchased a $10 million, seven-bedroom estate in North Salem in January. Gere snagged himself a deal, as it listed for $12.8 million. After buying the property, he dropped another $700,000 on a vacant neighboring parcel, which expanded the property to 35 acres. The location is a bit farther from Manhattan — about an hour and half. Gere married Spanish publicist and political activist Alejandra Silva, 37, in 2018 and share two children. The actor, who was also once married to supermodel Cindy Crawford also has a 21-year old son, Homer, from ex-wife Carey Lowell.
