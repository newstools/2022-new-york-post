Remember the dad from TLC’s “Jon & Kate Plus 8”? He released a hip-hop song on Friday. Jon Gosselin, 45, teamed up with The International DJ Casper for the track titled “Voicemail.” He shared a snippet of the Auto-Tune-heavy track on Instagram, asking fans to “Please share, download, and repost” the single. Jon also promoted a release party at a Philadelphia nightclub, set for Friday night. Nightlife isn’t new for him. After working a series of odd jobs, he stuck to DJing at an Atlantic City nightclub in 2017. He also briefly worked as a stripper at the club. His hip-hop debut isn’t a one-off, either. Gosselin told Dr. Oz in 2021 that he’d release a full album to give fans a glimpse into his nasty divorce from Kate, 47. “We’ve been working on this for about five years,” he said. “Everybody wanted me to write a book, so I was like, ‘OK, I’ll write a book.’ But I’m not, like, a ‘book person.’ But what if I did — I’ve been DJing for so long — what if I lyricized the book?” The TLC stars and parents to eight children were married for 10 years until they divorced in late 2009. Ready to feel old? Their twin daughters, Mady and Cara, are now 21, and the sextuplets — Collin, Hannah, Leah, Alexis, Aaden and Joel — are 18. Jon only has custody of Hannah and Collin after a tense legal battle with Kate. “I haven’t talked to my twins in eight years,” Jon said on “The Dr. Oz Show.” “I text them every single year. And every time I come here to your show or interview, I text my daughter every single time.” In 2020, Collin accused Jon of kicking and punching the then-16-year-old in a since-deleted Instagram post, prompting an investigation, according to People. Pennsylvania Children and Youth Services said the claims against him were “unfounded.”
