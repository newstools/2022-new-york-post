Someone should check on Bill Simmons after the Celtics suffered a crushing loss to the Bucks on Wednesday in Game 5 of their conference semifinals series. The Ringer founder, who is a Massachusetts native and Holy Cross alum, was captured by TNT cameras looking somber in his seat at TD Garden, where the Celtics collapsed, 110-107, after a last-second bucket by Bucks forward Bobby Portis. Simmons was spotted standing straight up in his seat with a poker face as Bucks star Jrue Holiday blocked a Marcus Smart bucket in the final seconds of the game. To make matters worse, Simmons had tweeted before the game that he had bet on the Celtics to win, with Jayson Tatum scoring 25 plus points. Lucky for Simmons, the latter hit, as Tatum dropped 34 points to go with six rebounds and four assists. Simmons snapped a photo with a fan before the game, in which the sports analyst appeared much happier. The fan expressed in her caption that she was excited to watch Simmons live-tweet the game, but he hasn’t tweeted a single thing since he predicted the Celtics to win Game 5. The tough loss came after NBA stars, including Draymond Green and, more recently, Joel Embiid, slammed Simmons for his “f–k Jalen Green” comment in April about the Rockets guard. The Bucks host the Celtics for Game 6 on Friday.
