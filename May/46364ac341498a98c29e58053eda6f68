An ex-convict on a burglary spree in Manhattan allegedly choked a woman until she passed out — but left that scene empty-handed after he was tackled by the victim’s 13-year-old son, police and sources said Tuesday. Dean Rogich, 41, was on supervised release when he was arrested Monday for allegedly committing a series of burglaries in the Greenwich Village and Chelsea neighborhoods, cops said. The thief committed his first burglary around 6:15 p.m. Sunday after he entered a 46-year-old woman’s apartment near 9th Street and Fifth Avenue, cops said. He tried to remove the victim’s purse and demanded she “Shut up and stop yelling!” when she caught him in the act. He then “struck her in the face with a closed first” and began choking her, cops said. The woman lost consciousness but her son was home and “tackled” the thief, cops said. The crook dropped the Matt & Nat backpack on his way out and fled the scene. The victim suffered minor injuries. He hit three other apartments before he was arrested Monday and tied to the crime. The three latest victims were women who lived in the same building in Chelsea, cops said. In one case, the victim was 100 years old and in another the victim was 88. “This guy’s a menace,” a police source said. “He’s terrorizing old ladies.” Rogich served 13 years in prison on a first degree burglary conviction and was released on April 28. He faces charges of burglary and criminal trespassing among others, cops said.
