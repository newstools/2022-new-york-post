Fresh off the Met Gala, actor and musician Ansel Elgort, 28, and his longtime girlfriend, dancer Violetta Komyshan, have bought a Greenwich Village loft on East 10th Street for $760,000, according to property records. That’s slightly above the home’s $750,000 asking price. Elgort, the “West Side Story” and “Baby Driver” star, has already been a homeowner for some time. His first purchase was an 1890 brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, according to a 2017 interview with Billboard. But news of this new purchase comes a week after “Shameless” actress Emma Kenney took to Twitter to blast Elgort’s appearance at the Met Gala, two years after he was accused of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl. Elgort has denied the accusations. The couple’s new home had been on the market a mere 26 days, according to StreetEasy. But the seller, listed in the transfer tax as actor Jacob Wallach, sold at a loss; he bought the 500-square-foot spread for $782,500 in 2018. The unit — a studio with a lofted bed — came gut-renovated. It gets lots of natural light, and has hardwood floors, exposed brick walls and 12-foot ceilings. Also renovated is the kitchen and the bathroom whose upgrades include a deep soaking tub. Building amenities include a bike room, a laundry room and a common roof deck. This co-op could be a pied-à-terre, as Elgort still owns his Brooklyn brownstone, which he bought for $1.89 million in 2015. At the time, Elgort said he wanted to buy something that wasn’t “someplace douchey.” He also said that his parents — fashion photographer Arthur Elgort and opera director Grethe Barrett Holby — told him: “The second you can afford to buy a place, buy a place. My whole life, I lived in an apartment where I couldn’t bounce a ball without getting into trouble. Now I can bounce a ball!” Elgort and Komyshan have been on and off together since their days at LaGuardia High School. The studio’s listing broker was Mark Griffith of Compass.
