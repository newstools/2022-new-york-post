The way you do things says more about you than you realize, including your handwriting. In fact, it can be the deciding factor on whether someone will want to be your friend or stay far away from you. Better known as graphology, the analysis of handwriting and how it relates to personality can reveal more than 5,000 personality traits, according to Reader’s Digest. According to master graphologist Kathi McKnight, people who write large are people-oriented and attention-seeking. However, those with small handwriting are introverted and are capable of intense concentration. If you write with a slight right slant, you’re most likely very friendly yet impulsive. A tilt to the left means you’re reserved and individualistic, while no slant means you’re logical and pragmatic. Handwriting with heavy pressure indicates you have strong emotions and are quick to react, while light pressure implies an easiness and ability to move from place to place. So, what does your handwriting say about you? According to a viral personality test, even how you hold your phone could say something about who you really are. The most common way to hold your phone is with a single hand, using your thumb to maneuver. If you do this then you are a carefree, happy, and self-assured individual. You have the ability to accept whatever life throws at you and never complain about it. Being confident about your ability you keep moving ahead grabbing any new chance in your path. You can also take chances and push yourself beyond your comfort zone. But if you scroll with one thumb and hold your phone in the other, then you are pragmatic, intuitive, and wise. Holding your phone in this manner means you would rather be cautious than take chances and lose a lot of money. You are empathetic, caring, and brilliant at decoding other people’s characters.
