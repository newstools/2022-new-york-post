The rain has beaten the Yankees again. For a second straight day, the Yankees’ game against the Rangers on Saturday afternoon was postponed by rain. It will be made up on Monday at 1:05 p.m. at Yankee Stadium, wiping out what was supposed to be an off day for both teams. The teams are already set to play a doubleheader on Sunday because of Friday’s washout. This is the Rangers’ only trip to The Bronx this season. The postponements mean the Yankees will now play on 22 straight days (23 games) through May 29.
