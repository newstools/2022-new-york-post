A penthouse duplex at 860 United Nations Plaza — a building once home to TV legend Johnny Carson, Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, actor Yul Brynner, writer Truman Capote, photographer Richard Avedon and news anchor Walter Cronkite — has hit the market for $4.2 million. The sellers, Michelle and Rashaad Bajwa, founders of Domain Computer Services, an IT and cyber security firm, paid $2.5 million for it in April 2021 — a “pre-vaccine COVID special” — and then renovated it, said broker Sabrina Kleier-Morgenstern, of Kleier Residential, who is listing it with Samantha and Michele Kleier. The four-bedroom, 4½-bath co-op is around 4,000 square feet. It was asking $4.5 million in 2019. The apartment boasts stunning views of the city skyline and the East River. It opens with a 25-foot entrance gallery, anchored by a curved staircase. A large living room features a woodburning fireplace and floor to ceiling windows while the dining room boasts a built in serving café. There’s also a large eat-in chef’s kitchen with a butler’s pantry. The second level features the main suite, with a large walk-in closet and sitting area. Details include hardwood floors, Lutron lights and an interior private elevator. The building, which dates to 1966, is one of two 39-story twin towers designed by (Wallace) Harrison & (Max) Abramovitz, the lead architects of the United Nations Headquarters complex, the Time-Life Building at Rockefeller Center and the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Building amenities include a gym, billiards room, golf simulator, two conference rooms, four sundecks with panoramic city views, a library, garage and private full block circular drive — the city’s longest private driveway.
