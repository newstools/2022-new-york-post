It’s one of The Sill’s most popular plants because it’s both beautiful and forgiving of first-time gardeners. You can’t go wrong with a classic, fiddle leaf fig.

The snake plant is a succulent characterized by its upright, sword-like leaves — the shape of which inspired its nickname, “mother-in-law’s tongue” — with vibrant yellow edges. It’s a popular houseplant because it tolerates low light and drought well, and valued for its air-purifying qualities. The quickest way to kill this plant is to over-care for it.
