We have ourselves a series. After dropping the first two games in Raleigh, the Rangers came back to the Garden on Sunday with a vengeance, defeating the Hurricanes 3-1 to make it a 2-1 series. The Blueshirts now have life after struggling mightily to score goals in the first two games. Igor Shesterkin was brilliant and the fans gave theRangers some juice as they look to even the series on Tuesday night at home. To talk about the big Game 3 win and look ahead to Game 4, we bring you a new episode of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Ron Duguay and Mollie Walker.
