Ninety-three-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist and Village Voice veteran Jules Feiffer and his wife, JZ Holden, are listing their Shelter Island home for $1.2 million. Feiffer — who is also the illustrator of Gimme’s favorite childhood book, “The Phantom Tollbooth” — moved to Shelter Island full time in 2017. The charming, shingle-style traditional home at 5 Emerson Lane, built in 2016, sits on just over half an acre. It features three bedrooms, two baths, wood floors, a fireplace and serene views, as it borders 45 acres of preserved land. There’s also a water-filtration system, a patio, and room for a pool. Feiffer has written more than 35 books, plays and screenplays, including the Academy Award-winning animated short film, “Munro,” “Carnal Knowledge” and “Popeye.” He is also in the Comic Book Hall of Fame. The listing broker is Douglas Elliman’s Dawn Watson.
