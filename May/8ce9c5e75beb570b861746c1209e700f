“Abbott Elementary” actress and creator Quinta Brunson is bristling that fans of the ABC sitcom have asked her to write a school shooting episode. On Wednesday, Brunson, 32, said viewers should redirect their energy to political change. “Wild how many people have asked for a school shooting episode of the show I write,” she wrote on social media. “People are that deeply removed from demanding more from the politicians they’ve elected and are instead demanding ‘entertainment.’ I can’t ask ‘are y’all ok’ anymore because the answer is ‘no,'” she wrote in a Twitter thread. “Please use that energy to ask your elected official to get on Beto time and nothing less. I’m begging you,” Brunson urged her followers. Her plea comes after 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday. An additional 17 people received non-life-threatening injuries. The alleged shooter, Salvador Ramos, had legally purchased two AR-15 assault rifles on his 18th birthday; he then took one into the school before he opened fire, according to police. “I don’t want to sound mean, but I want people to understand the flaw in asking for something like this. we’re not okay. this country is rotting our brains. I’m sad about it,” Brunson continued in her posts. She even shared a screenshot of “one of the many” shooting-related pitches she receives. “This is just an idea,” the fan writes. “For the eventual series finale, a school shooting episode to highlight the numerous ones in this nation. Formulate an angle that would get our government to understand why laws need to pass. “I think Abbott Elementary can affect change. I love the show,” the suggestion concluded. Representatives for ABC and the show did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Post. The hit mockumentary premiered in December. Brunson plays the lead character, second-grade teacher Janine Teagues, at the fictional Philadelphia school.
