Jets fans are on cloud nine right now. They just had one of their best drafts, at least on paper, in a very long time. It started with snagging the top cornerback in Sauce Gardner. Then. they got the top wide receiver in Garrett Wilson. Joe Douglas said ‘I’m not done yet..’ .and traded up to snag a top-three pass rusher in Jermaine Johnson. Oh yeah, and then he started Day 2 of the 2022 NFL Draft by taking the top-ranked running back, Breece Hall. Home. Run. Jets.
