Connor McDavid may have delivered a thrilling finish to the Oilers’ second-round playoff series, but it seems some of the internet’s attention was directed elsewhere on Thursday night. With Edmonton one win away from advancing to the Western Conference Finals, some of the Calgary Flames’ biggest fans invaded Scotiabank Saddledome for Game 5, including a group of models, who were seated directly behind the Oilers’ bench. Throughout the game, the lively group was seen cheering, with one model glancing in the direction of Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft. Although Woodcroft appeared to keep his attention on the ice, Twitter was zoned in on the action taking place behind him. “Definitely some distractions behind the Oilers bench,” one user remarked while another said, “Ummm… there are apparently some ladies behind the Oilers bench…” Another Twitter user speculated if the Flames orchestrated the seating arrangements. “Did the #Flames plant those chickadees behind the #Oilers bench to try & distract them? Also. Is it working?!” the user commented. It seems the Oilers didn’t find the models’ presence a distraction, as McDavid put the game away in overtime with the game-winning goal. The Oilers will face the winner of the Colorado Avalanche and St. Louis Blues series, with their Game 6 getting underway Friday night. The Avalanche currently leads the series, 3-2.
