If you have young children, you know the importance of teaching them about safety. Kids are vulnerable, so parents and caretakers are often concerned about letting them out of their sight. An author, motivational speaker, and mom-of-six named Chauvon Landry, who goes by @thelandryfamily504 on TikTok, often shares useful parenting hacks and life advice. She recently shared a “survival tactic” that’s pretty unexpected—and people are loving it. “Ok so here’s a survival tactic that I teach my kids that I hope they never have to use. “It could save your child’s life so listen up.” If children ever find themselves in danger—if someone is trying to kidnap them or force them into doing something they don’t want to do—they shouldn’t just scream. “I need them to yell out every single curse word they could possibly think of.” “Because think about it, if you’re at a playground or something and you hear a child scream, that’s not really alarming to you. “But if you hear a child yelling out every single curse word, you’re going to stop mid-conversation and say, ‘Hold on,’ and look to see what’s going on with this child, why is this child saying every single curse word like that.” The strange, erratic behavior of the child will serve as a signal to other adults around that they do not belong to this person trying to take them away. “They are calling out for help. And when they call out for mom, it’s time for all of us to stand up and help this child, alright? So I hope that helps.” Viewers thought the idea was brilliant, with some joking about how much their kids would love it too: “My child would be secretly waiting on the day to come,” one person quipped. “My child would be like, ‘Well, it’s my time to shine,’” added another. A third person offered their own advice: “I tell mine to tell ‘You’re not my parent. You’re not my parent. Let me go!’” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission
