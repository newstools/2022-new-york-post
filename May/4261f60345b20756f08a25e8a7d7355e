Well New Yorkers, what were you most impressed with this week? The first-place Yankees and Mets, the Rangers’ heart, Manhattanhenge or Stitches winning 12 of his last 14 games? In search of another quality pick, we find a couple of quality starters taking the mound in Toronto. The White Sox’s Lucas Giolito (3-1, 2.63) has allowed only four runs over his last 18 innings. The Blue Jays’ Kevin Gausman (4-3, 2.20) has given up five over 18. Gausman tossed a gem at St. Louis in his last start, shutting out the Cards over six strong. With the Sox’s Tim Anderson (groin strain) headed to the injury list we will fly with the Jays for 10 units. Our groin felt a bit strained watching the Twins on Monday. Minnesota hit three homers off Beau Brieske, but the Tigers played small-ball, manufacturing 13 hits, and the Twinkies were devoured by the Tigers, 7-5. Still up +594 knoblauchs.
