A city correction officer jumped to his death from the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge Friday morning, according officials. Edward Roman, 38, was observed parking his car mid-span on the Brooklyn-bound side of the bridge and jumping into the water just after 6:30 a.m., cops and corrections officials said. NYPD divers were deployed and the victim was ultimately recovered by the US Coast Guard, cops said. EMS responded to the Coast Guard base on Search Lane in Staten Island and rushed the man to Staten Island University Hospital North with life-threatening injuries, police said. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. “Edward Roman served this city and this department honorably as correction officer for 10 years,” DOC  Commissioner Louis Molina said. “Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family and loved ones. We had been praying for his recovery, and now this tragic loss will be felt across the agency.” Correction Officers Benevolent Association President Benny Boscio said in a statement, “Our hearts are broken and our thoughts and prayers are with Officer Roman’s family and his fellow officers.” If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling.
