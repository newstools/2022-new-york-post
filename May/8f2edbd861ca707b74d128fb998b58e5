It seems Josh Allen isn’t buying this tale of the tape. On Wednesday, Tom Brady showed off his skills on the golf course, with the Buccaneers quarterback, 44, appearing to get a hole-in-one. “This is why you film every shot on the course…” Brady captioned the video on Twitter, which not only features his reaction to the shot but apparent drone footage capturing the hole as well. Though the video impressed Patrick Mahomes, Allen — who, along with the Chiefs quarterback, will face Brady and Aaron Rodgers in next week’s “The Match” — called “bulls–t” on the clip. Taking to Twitter, the Bills quarterback, 26, responded to Brady’s video with a GIF of Adam Sandler uttering, “Ba Ba Ba Bulls–t.” Brady has not replied to Allen as of Wednesday afternoon. The jabs between quarterbacks have been flying the past few days. In a clip posted Tuesday from Bleacher Report, Brady mocked Mahomes and Rodgers over the loss of their beloved wideouts, Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams, respectively, who departed the Chiefs and Packers in free agency. “I got my boy Mike there ready to catch,” Brady said of Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans, whose cutout was part of the chip challenge. “I don’t know, who caught Aaron’s? Davante left him, and Tyreek left you, Patrick. Josh, don’t worry, someone’s going to leave you, too. “My boy Mike never left me, I’ll tell you that,” Brady continued. Though Evans never left Brady, the quarterback briefly left him as part of his short-lived retirement earlier this year. Brady returned to Tampa Bay in March, where he and Evans will chase their second Super Bowl together this fall. In the meantime, Evans will likely be backing Brady and Rodgers, 37, when “The Match” gets underway in Las Vegas next week.
