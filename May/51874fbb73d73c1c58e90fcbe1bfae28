Two women were killed in separate Long Island crashes late Monday, authorities said. Cherokee Fletcher, 28, was standing on the sidewalk when an out-of-control car slammed into her in Hauppage around 10:15 p.m., Suffolk County Police said. The driver of the car, believed to be a sedan, was heading east on Motor Parkway when the motorist collided with another vehicle at the intersection of Moreland Road and veered off the roadway, cops said. Once on the sidewalk, the driver then struck Fletcher and drove off, heading east on Motor Parkway, police said. Fletcher, of Commack, was pronounced dead on scene by a physician assistant from the office of the Suffolk County Medical Examiner. About 15 minutes later, Tracey Dorismond, 32, was fatally struck on a West Islip street, authorities said. A driver was heading west on Montauk Highway, near Pease Lane, when the motorist struck Dorismond in the street around 10:30 p.m., cops said. The driver then fled the scene, heading westbound, police said. Dorismond, of Brentwood, was also pronounced dead on scene. No arrests have been made in either case.
