After all, she is the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Ellie Kemper, the Princeton-educated actress and comedian who held the starring role in the “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” Netflix sitcom, has found a buyer for her chic Manhattan apartment after just more than a month on the market. That’s according to a StreetEasy listing update for the three-bedroom Upper West Side co-op, which — in the lead-up to its entrance on the sales market — aimed to list for $3.35 million. Ultimately, it went up for sale asking a higher $3.5 million in late March. The contract price isn’t known, same goes for the identity of the new owner, but the renovated residence kept its $3.5 million asking price during its brief time for sale. The listing agent, Maria Manuche of Compass, declined The Post’s request for comment. Kemper, who hails from Missouri — and her comedian and television writer husband, Michael Koman — bought the prewar home for $2.8 million in early 2016, according to the transfer taxes filed with the city that year. The unit also has three bathrooms — and listing images show the couple dressed the unit in an elegant way. Pastel-tone walls mix well with old-world herringbone hardwood floors, wainscoting and moldings. Located off a semi-private elevator vestibule, the apartment has side-by-side living, dining and great rooms with three exposures that look out to townhouse gardens. What’s more, every room has 10-foot ceilings. Elsewhere, there’s an eat-in kitchen with chef-grade appliances, granite counters and plenty of built-in storage. The bedrooms also come with good storage space — while other home perks include new double pane thermal windows, through-wall air conditioning and a washer/dryer.
