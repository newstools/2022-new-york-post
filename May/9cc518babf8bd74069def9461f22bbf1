The delivery truck driver who allegedly struck and killed a 16-year-old girl as she walked to school in the Bronx Wednesday has been charged with moving violations in the incident, cops said. Joseph Zillitto, Jr., 46, was making a left turn when he allegedly struck Alissa Kolenovic — who was crossing Paulding Avenue at the Neill Avenue intersection in Morris Park around 8:20 a.m., cops said. He stayed on scene and was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to use due care, police said. Kolenovic — who lived about a block away from the scene — was rushed to Jacobi Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, authorities said. Zillitto is a Bronx resident, but lives more than three miles from the scene, according to police.
