Mother Nature must celebrate Mother’s Day too. The multi-day drenching of the New York area will be over by early Sunday, gifting moms throughout the region with some dry, if not sunny, skies. The worst of the rain that’s been soaking the metro for days should move out overnight, Fox Weather meteorologist Jordan Overton said. Except for some scattered showers, Sunday should be cloudy but dry. “When we get this marine layer like this, there’s always some chance of a sprinkle,” Overton said. “But it definitely won’t be as bad as Saturday.” Temperatures will rise to the mid-50s, about 10-to-15 degrees below normal for May. The thermometer will drop into the 40s overnight, chilly for this late in the spring. The sun will return Monday and bring with it more normal temps, rising into the mid-60s. The week looks to be partly sunny, with the thermometer nearing 70 by Wednesday.
