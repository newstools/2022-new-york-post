The summer-like heat wave isn’t keeping skiers from the slopes in Vermont. “iI’s going to be a H-O-T one on Saturday with temps flirting with the 90-degree mark!” the famed resort Killington posted on its website. “Superstar is ready to rock with top to bottom skiing.” “Superstar” is a World Cup ski run on Skye Peak mountain. The resort’s webcam shows a strip of white slashing through the lush foliage, with countless skiers heading down the slope. Killington’s website says the mountain still has a 20-inch snowpack, though it notes no new snow has fallen in the past 24 hours.
