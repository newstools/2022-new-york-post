The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., was shut down Saturday morning after a crowd of seniors from Georgetown University left broken bottles and spilled wine on the monument’s steps. Hundreds of students had gathered to watch the sunrise Saturday after the senior ball on Friday. A few took a dip in the Reflecting Pool. The National Park Service announced a brief delay in accessibility to the Lincoln Memorial, saying the group had left debris in the area. “The Lincoln Memorial is closed this morning following a local university graduation celebration that left litter, broken bottles and spilled wine and champagne covering the steps,” the National Park Service announced Saturday morning. By around 11 a.m., the memorial was reopened to the public. “Thanks to our facilities staff for the quick cleanup this morning. The Lincoln Memorial is open. We appreciate your patience,” the park service said. Fox News’ Madison Adams and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.
