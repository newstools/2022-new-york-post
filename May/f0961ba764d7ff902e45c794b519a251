Ric Flair is getting back in the ring for one last match. The 73-year-old pro wrestling legend announced Monday he will wrestle his final match on July 31 at The Fairgrounds in Nashville on an event that will air on Fite TV. Flair’s opponent was not revealed but the match will be part of a full card of matches produced by Thuzio that takes place a day after the WWE holds SummerSlam at the Titans’ stadium in Nashville. “The Rumors Are True! I’m Going To Walk That Aisle, Style And Profile, One Last Time! July 31st! Nashville, Tennessee! Jim Crockett Promotions!” Flair wrote on social media. “I Will Prove Once Again, That To Be The Man, You’ve Got To Beat The Man! Now We Go To School! WOOOOO!” Flair, who became a household name as “The Nature Boy,” performing for NWA and WCW, last wrestled Sting for Impact Wrestling in 2011. His last WWE match was against Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008. Recent videos of Flair training in the ring with fellow wrestler Jay Lethal prompted speculation that the former was preparing for a comeback. WWE released Flair from his contract last August. Flair, who has admitted previous alcohol issues, dealt with a health scare five years ago, suffering kidney failure after complications from bowel surgery. He was hospitalized for more than a month.
