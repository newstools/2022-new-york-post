Haley Kalil appears to be staying positive amid her recent divorce from former NFL player Matt Kalil. On Thursday, the same day news emerged that the couple had split, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, 29, took to her Instagram Stories to share a positive affirmation. “You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life,” Kalil shared in white text over a black background. Kalil filed documents on Wednesday and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for her split from Matt, 32, according to court records obtained by TMZ. The now-former couple originally tied the knot in July 2015 before separating in January, per the documents. They have no children together. As of Friday morning, Kalil has yet to address the divorce publicly but has been active on social media. In addition to sharing a cryptic message on her Instagram Stories, she’s also posted photos of her dog. The American model bust onto the scene in 2018, when she was featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue as a contestant in the first-ever Sports Illustrated Swim Search, alongside fellow contest winner, Camille Kostek, the girlfriend of Super Bowl champion tight end, Rob Gronkowski. Matt, meanwhile, is a former Pro Bowl offensive tackle who last played in the league in 2019 as a member of the Texans.
