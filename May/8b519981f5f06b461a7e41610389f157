Police have identified the victim of a hit-and-run fatality involving an MTA bus on Staten Island. The fallen pedestrian, Patrick Varriale, 69, was a resident of the New Springville section, authorities said Friday night. Varriale was found just before 4:40 a.m. Friday, unconscious at the intersection of Forest Hill Road and Platinum Avenue, a block away from the MTA Yukon Bus Depot, cops said. He suffered “severe” body trauma and died at the scene, police said. A preliminary investigation determined that a 52-year-old male MTA bus driver was traveling eastbound on Forest Hill when he made a left turn onto northbound Platinum Avenue, authorities said. Varriale was crossing the location when the pedestrian was struck by the bus, cops said. The bus left the scene and continued to travel northbound on Platinum Avenue, police said. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad is investigating and will determine if there is any criminality, cops said. The bus driver has been taken off duty depending on the results of the probe, according to the MTA.
