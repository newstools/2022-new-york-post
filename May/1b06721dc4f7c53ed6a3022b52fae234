Max Scherzer is prone to the occasional outburst from the dugout at the home plate umpire on behalf of his fellow Mets pitchers, but that doesn’t mean he’s ready to completely overhaul the system for determining balls and strikes.

Scherzer this week spoke to Sports+ about the issue. What are your thoughts on the possibility of automated balls and strikes in MLB in the not-too-distant future?
