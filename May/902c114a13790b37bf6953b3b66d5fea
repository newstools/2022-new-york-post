Preakness day at Pimlico. From the man who gave you Rombauer last year … the black-eyed Stitches makes it two straight with Early Voting. The first-place Brewers play host to the last-place Nationals. Patrick Corbin (0-6, 6.28 ERA) goes for Washington. Corbin has been hit hard all year (46 times in 38 innings to be precise) and comes off a forgettable five-run loss to the Astros on Sunday. Milwaukee’s Brandon Woodruff (4-2, 5.35 ERA) has been minimally better, but the Brewers’ bats can bail him out.  Didn’t need them in his last start, allowing one run over five frames in Miami last Sunday. We were all over it. We’re backing him again. 10 units on the Brew Crew. The winds were blowing out at Wrigley Field. Eleven home runs later, the Diamondbacks rattled the Cubs 10-6. Arizona hit seven. Josh Rojas was responsible for three. Kyle Hendricks was the most charitable pitcher, watching four clear the ivy. Cubs lose. We lose. Still up +288 harrycarays.
