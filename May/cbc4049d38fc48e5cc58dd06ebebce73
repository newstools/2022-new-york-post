Kay Adams got emotional Friday in her sign-off from “Good Morning Football.” Adams, who has been part of NFL Network’s morning show for six years, expressed gratitude for her teammates, both on and off camera, as well as members of the league, and viewers who have tuned in. “I am so blown away by the love — overwhelmed,” Adams said, emotionally. “Thank you so much. So you see, it’s not for people who love football or fun, it was never that. It’s this perfect conflation of magic. So thank you to every person that’s ever touched this show, or chosen to spend time with us. I’m really grateful.” Adams also took a moment to thank her co-hosts, Kyle Brandt, Peter Schrager, and “Good Morning Football” alum Nate Burleson, who returned for Friday’s show after leaving the program in August 2021 for “CBS This Morning.” News of Adams’ departure was first reported by The Post’s Andrew Marchand last month, with Amazon tabbed as a potential landing spot, as their Prime Video service is picking up “Thursday Night Football” for the upcoming season. Adams did not elaborate on her future career plans Friday, however. “I don’t know the answers to where I’m going or what I’m doing or when you’ll see me next, but I really just have deep gratitude so thank you, guys,” she said. “We’ve been through a lot on this show.” Adams did share how she’s planning to toast to the next chapter, though. “We’ll celebrate after this and you’ll be carrying me out of a bar somewhere in Lower Manhattan,” she said.
