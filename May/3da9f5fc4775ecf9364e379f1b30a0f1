Game Four of Bucks-Celtics leads off Monday’s NBA slate and Munaf Manji of The Action Network has two favorite player prop bets to share (video above). For his first prop play, Manji is targeting Milwaukee Bucks point guard Jrue Holiday over 1.5 steals. For Manji, the overall defensive intensity of the series contributes to this pick. Holiday, who has struggled a touch on the offensive end, has led the charge for Milwaukee defensively. “Jrue Holiday has had at least two steals in every game so far,” Manji says. “In fact, he’s had at least three steals in two of three games this series.” Plus, the Bucks are forcing close to 15 turnovers per game against the Celtics and are averaging 8.3 steals/game in the series thus far. For those reasons, Manji is choosing to back Holiday once again as he attempts to clear this benchmark for the fourth straight contest.  For his second player prop bet, Manji is looking over to the Celtics side. Specifically, he’s backing center Al Horford over 8.5 rebounds. This is a case of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” for Manji as Horford has proven a very reliable rebounder so far in this series. “In the first three games of the series, Horford has grabbed double-digit rebounds in all three,” Manji says.  Plus, Horford is averaging close to 5.5 more minutes per game this series compared to the Celtics’ opening series against the Nets to help contribute to his 12.3 rebounds/game against the Bucks. Add in that the Bucks don’t possess a traditional interior presence to counter Horford and Manji likes him to clear this benchmark in Game Four.
