California Gov. Gavin Newsom has tested positive for COVID-19, and will work remotely for at least the next five days, his office said Saturday. Newsom, 54, is showing mild symptoms and will remain in isolation until he tests negative, his office said in a statement tweeted out Saturday. The governor, who is vaccinated and boosted, has also gotten a prescription for the antiviral drug Paxlovid, the statement said. He was forced to apologize in November 2020 when he was caught at a pricey birthday dinner for 12 even though he’d scolded state residents for socializing during a pandemic. “I should have modeled better behavior,” Newsom said after word spread that he and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom gathered with people from multiple households at Napa’s famed French Laundry restaurant. And in January, Newsom again admitted to breaking COVID rules after he was caught going maskless “for a few moments” at SoFi Stadium for the 49ers-Rams NFL game — in defiance of a local mask mandate and the LA stadium’s own requirements.
