Two NBA playoff contests fill Monday’s card and Munaf Manji of The Action Network is here to share his best player prop bet for each (video above). His first prop play comes in an Eastern Conference semifinal between the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers. In that matchup, Manji is backing 76ers forward Tobias Harris ‘over’ 7.5 rebounds -150 on BetRivers. Manji expects that, without center Joel Embiid in the lineup, other 76ers will have to pick up his rebounding slack. Given Harris has a great rebounding record against the Heat, Manji believes there’s no better candidate. “In four meetings during the regular season against the Heat, Harris grabbed at least eight rebounds in three,” Manji says. Plus, in the first round against the Raptors, Harris averaged close to nine rebounds per contest and cleared this benchmark in four of six games. Further, Manji believes the market hasn’t accounted for the 11 rebounds/game Embiid averaged and believes Harris is capable of reaching double figures tonight in Miami. For his second player prop bet, Manji is looking out West to Game One between the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns. In that tilt, he’s choosing to back Suns point guard Chris Paul ‘over’ 9.5 assists -145 on BetMGM. The number is a little juiced to the over – Manji likes it all the way up to 10.5 – but Paul has posted very good numbers against the Mavericks in the regular season. In three meetings with the Mavericks, Paul averaged 13 assists per game and posted at least 10 assists in all three matchups as well. Additionally, in the Suns’ first-round series against the Pelicans, Paul averaged 11.3 assists/game and cleared this benchmark in five of six.  Although the Mavericks’ defense has improved of late, Manji expects Paul to produce another strong performance and clear this high total.
