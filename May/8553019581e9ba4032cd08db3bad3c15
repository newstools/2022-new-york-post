A man died and a woman was rescued after they apparently attempted to climb over a fence in waters at the US-Mexico border Tuesday morning, officials said. The San Diego Fire Rescue Department responded to reports of a woman stuck on fencing between Playas de Tijuana in Mexico and California’s Border Field State Park. “By the time we arrived she had already been rescued by Tijuana lifeguards and brought to the US side,” said San Diego Fire Rescue official Jose Ysea. After the woman was pulled from the water, she told officials that a man she was with was still out in the ocean, prompting another search and rescue effort, Ysea told The Post. Imperial Beach lifeguards found the man about 200 to 300 feet north of the border. He was given CPR, but died at the scene, Ysea said. The woman was treated by medics and released to Border Patrol agents. No additional information on the two people was provided. Ysea said he had “pleaded” for the ages of the man and woman, asking if they were in their 20s, 30s or 40s, but was not able to get an answer.
