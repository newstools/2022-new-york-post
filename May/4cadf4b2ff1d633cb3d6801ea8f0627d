A woman’s rotting body was found inside a Bronx apartment — with a bag covering her head — over the weekend, and cops confirmed Thursday she was murdered. Norayshma Fernandez, 34, was discovered lying face-down in the front bedroom of the apartment on Ogden Avenue near West 167th Street in Highbridge around 7:50 p.m. Saturday, police said. Police responded to a 911 call of a foul odor in the apartment, and the FDNY breached the door to gain access, cops said. Fernandez’s “highly decomposed” body was wrapped in a blue and white blanket, and a black plastic bag was covering her head, cops said. She was pronounced dead on scene by EMS. Her death was ruled a homicide on Wednesday, and cops confirmed she died by asphyxia. Fernandez lives about a half-mile from the building where her body was found. No arrests were immediately made, and no information was immediately known on a suspect.
