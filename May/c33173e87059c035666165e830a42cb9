North Korea fired a ballistic missile, likely from a submarine, off the port city of Sinpo along the country’s eastern coast. The missile flew roughly 370 miles and reached an altitude of 37 miles, South Korean officials said, providing few other details. It’s believed to be the most recent submarine-launched ballistic missile by North Korea, which last demonstrated such a weapon in October. The launch “highlights the destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s illicit weapons program,” US military’s Indo-Pacific Command said, noting the missile did not pose an immediate threat to US territory or personnel. “The US commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad,” US officials added. Japan also said the rocket fell outside of their territorial waters and reported no damage to their vessels. South Korean officials denounced the launch and urged North Korea to return to long-stalled denuclearization talks. The missile was the first submarine-launched weapon from the North since last October. With Post Wires
