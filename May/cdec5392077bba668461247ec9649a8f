Najee Harris is not much heavier than last year, he says. Tuesday morning, Steelers reporters were talking about the second-year running back now weighing 244 pounds. Mark Kaboly of The Athletic tweeted about it, and Steelers Nation Radio host Wes Uhler tweeted that Harris had come up to him and his co-host to “make sure” that they know he weighs 244 pounds. Harris is listed on the Steelers’ web site at 232 pounds, which would mean a significant bulk-up has occurred this offseason. With this as the backdrop, NFL aggregator Dov Kleiman shared Kaboly’s report about Harris’ weight gain, and Harris jumped all over him for it. “Bra I weighed 240 last year,” Harris tweeted. “Reporters really don’t be knowing nothing just be tweeting s–t.” The 24-year-old Harris’ issue, of course, should be with the Steelers for potentially listing his weight wrong, rather than with a reporter for accurately citing what his employers said he weighed. Last season, Harris carried the ball 307 times for 1,200 yards and seven touchdowns.
