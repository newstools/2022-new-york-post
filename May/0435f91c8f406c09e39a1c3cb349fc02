Ivanka Trump recently traveled to Poland to meet with Ukrainian refugees and deliver food to families, according to her social media posts Sunday. “​Grateful to have spent the last few days in Krakow & Warsaw to meet Ukrainian and Polish faith leaders who have shown so much compassion & love to Ukrainian families in need & for the opportunity to bear witness to the love, strength & resilience within each of these families,” Ivanka wrote on Instagram and Twitter. The eldest daughter of former President Donald Trump shared photos of her ​playing guitars with a young girl, chatting with teenage students, embracing a mother and meeting with a Ukrainian family. The trip ​came through an invitation from CityServe, a non-profit organization that has been delivering food and aid to refugees. ”There she met with dozens of pastors serving Ukrainians on the frontlines, many of which helped support the 1 million meal distribution in March​,” a spokesperson for the organization told the Daily Mail. “​This week, they brought meals, financial support and toys to dozens of Ukrainian families seeking both short-term and long-term refuge in Poland until they can safely return to Ukraine,​” the person said.
