A probe into the death of escaped Alabama inmate Casey Coal White’s girlfriend was reopened by local authorities after the murder suspect’s dramatic capture has drawn attention to the decades-old case. Christy Shelton, 31, was killed with a sawed-off shotgun in 2008 and later discovered in a trailer owned by White’s mother. The Limestone County Sheriff’s Office renewed the investigation on Tuesday as Shelton’s family continued to insist her passing was not due to suicide. “Casey White was with my mom the night that she committed suicide,” Somer Mitchell, the daughter of Christy Shelton, told Alabama’s News 19. “Nothing was really done. I don’t think they took him in for questioning. So maybe this video will fall into the right hands of someone that can actually make a difference or look into it more maybe investigate. I’m not really sure.” Seven years after Shelton’s death, White went on a violent crime spree and broke into the home of another former gal pal and opened fire — killing the woman’s dog. He was sentenced to 75 years in prison for the 2015 rampage but escaped on April 29 with the help of prison guard Vicky White. The pair were apprehended on Monday after a dramatic 10-day manhunt that ended in a car crash. Vicky White died from a self-inflicted gunshot after the wreck.
