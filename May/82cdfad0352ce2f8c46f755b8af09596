Two men were stabbed to death overnight in the Big Apple — a 28-year-old attacked in Greenwich Village, and a 58-year-old in Queens, cops said. The younger man, identified as Samer Abdalla, got into an argument with a group of men at West 4th Street and Sixth Avenue around 1:30 a.m. Friday when he was knifed in the torso, cops said. Abdalla, of Bay Ridge, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, cops said. The men who had clashed with Abdalla fled before police arrived, police said. No weapons were recovered, and no arrests have been made. Police did not have any details on the nature of the dispute. In a separate incident late Thursday, 58-year-old Curtis Rippe was stabbed to death, apparently in a parking lot for a Mobil gas station on Horace Harding Expressway in Corona, cops said. Rippe, who may have been “quasi-homeless” and living out of a car, got into a squabble with two men when he was stabbed in the torso just before midnight, police said. He was rushed to New York Presbyterian Hospital-Queens, where he could not be saved, cops said. The men fled on foot before cops arrived, authorities said. A 26-year-old man was taken into custody nearby, and no charges were immediately filed. No weapons were recovered.
