A Brooklyn man was busted with a $20,000 arsenal of ghost gun parts, including nearly 300 high-capacity magazines that he allegedly purchased online, officials announced Wednesday. Rene Loyola, 25, is accused of ordering the massive cache of weapons parts from 12 separate online retailers between March 2020 and March 2022, the Manhattan and Brooklyn district attorneys said in a joint press release. Loyola had allegedly gotten some of the firearms parts shipped to a Pennsylvania address in order to avoid New York’s strict gun laws. Law enforcement raided Loyola’s Brooklyn apartment and a storage unit in Manhattan on April 20 and recovered the gear — including more than 30 gun frames and receivers and almost 300 high-capacity magazines that could hold nearly 9,000 rounds, officials said. Loyola was indicted by a grand jury May 6 on 235 counts of criminal possession of a weapon and other related charges. He appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday with his attorney and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said Loyola posted bail, which had been set at $150,000 cash or $200,000 bond. Wearing a striped, short-sleeved shirt, dark pants and black face mask, Loyola refused to comment as he walked out of court with his girlfriend. “New York’s strict laws initially kept these magazines out of our state, but Rene Loyola eventually took advantage of lax regulations elsewhere,” said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez added: “This defendant allegedly acquired a massive arsenal of gun parts that could easily have ended up as illegal ghost guns on the streets of our communities.” “Recovering these receivers, frames and magazines is important as we continue to fight to curtail the gun violence plaguing our city. I thank D.A. Bragg and the NYPD for their collaboration.”
