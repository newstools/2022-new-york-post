For any DIY experts, garden pros, or home design lovers, Home Depot is the mecca. Walking through the store’s massive aisles, you’ll definitely end up taking home things you didn’t really need. One former Home Depot employee named Jaime Garman, who goes by @jaime_the_craftery on TikTok, received over 200k views on a video that revealed a little-known fact about the store’s prices. She began: “So, I used to work at Home Depot for like eight years or so. This isn’t really a secret, but people don’t really know about it. While many of us have seen the “contractors’ discount” signs at the store, we never thought it would apply to us. Apparently, however, it might. “You don’t have to be a contractor to get contractor discounts. “Any time you’re buying anything in bulk — like if you’re re-doing a room and you’re buying a bunch of sheets of plywood, or dry wall, or screws — anything where you’re buying several of something, if you just go to the pro desk or the service desk and ask for your order to be submitted to the bid room, they can submit it and get you a bulk discount. “Usually only contractors only know about that because that’s who typically buys in bulk, but anybody could use it.” Next time you’re about to tackle a room remodel or outdoor renovation, be sure to ask for the bid room to save cash. In the comments section, Jaime clarified that there is a minimum spend to get the discount: “I believe it’s $1,000 or $1,200. But you can add to the bid if you come back for more.” Viewers in the comments said that this can also be done at Lowe’s, and some expressed regret about not knowing the hack sooner: “Nooo! Just remodeled a whole house and never knew this,” one person wrote. “This is gold! I’m looking at doing my floors in three rooms and the foyer… thank you,” another added.
