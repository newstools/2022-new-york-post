Draft night couldn’t have worked out any better for Jeremy Ruckert. The Lindenhurst, N.Y. native went to the Jets Friday night in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft — the team he grew up rooting for as a kid. His family couldn’t have been any happier. An Instagram video of Ruckert getting the call, originally shared by his girlfriend Robyn Haines, shows his family and friends elated at the news he’d be staying close to home. His dad in particular had a memorable reaction, hugging his son close before letting out a guttural roar. And then, of course, starting a loud “J-E-T-S” chant.

Ruckert, a tight end out of Ohio State, caught 26 balls for 309 yards last season with the Buckeyes. He’ll join up with his former teammate Garrett Wilson, who went No. 10 overall to the Jets, to help give Zach Wilson more options receiving options this season. The Jets retooled at every skill position in the first three rounds, taking Iowa State running back Breece Hall in the second between Garrett Wilson in the first and Ruckert in the third. They also added to their defense with cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner at No. 4 overall and defensive end Jermaine Johnson late in the first round after a trade up. It’s probably fair to say, though, that none of those players were as happy to be with the Jets as Ruckert. “It’s a dream come true,” Ruckert told reporters following the pick. “I’ve dreamed of this since I was a little kid. I grew up a Jets fan. My whole family grew up Jets fans. Going to practices when they used to practice at Hofstra and going to games as a kid. The story’s still being written and I can’t wait to get to work but in this moment right now, I’m super excited and my family is super excited.”
