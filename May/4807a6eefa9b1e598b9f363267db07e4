The Mets have survived multiple injuries to their rotation so far this season, but a potential doomsday scenario unfolded in Wednesday’ night’s 11-4 win over the Cardinals. Max Scherzer was in the midst of another strong outing when he threw his 87th pitch of the night, a slider in the dirt. On his walk back to the mound, he motioned to the dugout with a wave across his neck, signaling he was done for the night. A short mound meeting later, Scherzer walked off with a trainer, ending his night with an apparent injury with two outs in the sixth inning against the Cardinals. As Scherzer was walking off the mound he could be heard saying, “I’m done, I’m done.” Per the team, the right exited with “discomfort in his left side” and will undergo imaging on Thursday. The Mets are already dealing with injuries to Jacob deGrom (stress reaction on right scapula) and Tylor Megill (right biceps tendinitis).
