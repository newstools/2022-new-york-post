The body of a missing toddler was found Monday in a Michigan creek — a day after he disappeared from a trailer park while wearing his pajamas, according to reports. Emergency crews discovered the body of 1-year-old Noah Alan Jordan about 9 a.m. in Buck Creek near Clay Avenue and 54th Street in Kent County, WOOD reported. The tragic tot was found about a mile north of Cutler Estates in Byron Township, where he went missing about 11 a.m. Sunday, the sheriff’s office said. “It’s always hard with kids, especially,” Kent County Sheriff’s Sgt. Eric Brunner said, MLive.com reported. “You work extra hard.” He said rescuers had searched 1.5 miles of the creek on Sunday, when the water levels were much higher. Divers and drones also were used during the search. Police found footprints near Buck Creek and considered that area as a potential spot where Noah entered the water. Brunner said sheriff’s deputies were with Noah’s distraught family.“Our hearts go out to them,” he said. “Oftentimes kids just wander away, one minute you see them and one minute you don’t, so there’s nothing to lead us to believe that there was anything suspicious or criminal in nature,” he said, WOOD reported.
