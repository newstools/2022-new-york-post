We’ve broken down our four favorite derivative bets for the 2022 PGA Championship, and now we turn our attention to the matchups. In all of the following three cases, I’ve identified players that the market has rated as underdogs but my projections make them favorites. Additionally, there has been some interesting line moves in these matchups. With that in mind, let’s dive into my three matchup selections for the PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club. Call me crazy, but I can’t believe this price for this specific matchup. If you read my derivatives column, you already know I’m high on Bradley, who sits inside the top-10 in all my 24-, 36- and 50-round model projections and opened as a +100 underdog here. Plus, it bears worth repeating that Bradley has finished inside the top-10 in three of his last four starts, including a fifth-place finish at the PLAYERS Championship. On the flip side, I don’t understand the love for Hatton at all. He’s 91st in my 50-round model, 88th in my 36-round projection, and 79th overall across his last 24 qualifying rounds. Just in terms of the latter projection, Hatton ranks out inside the top-60 in only one statistical measure and ranks outside the top-80 in both driving distance (81st) and SG: around the green (110th).  Lastly, Hatton holds a horrific record in the majors lately. In his last five starts, he’s gone 52-MC-MC-38-18. He also missed the cut in all three majors held in the 2020 calendar year. Even if you just consider both players’ strokes-gained record on 7400-plus yard courses, the advantage still lies with Bradley. Across his last 36 qualifying rounds, the 2011 PGA champion in 26th in SG: total while Hatton sits 74th. For all those reasons, I’d play Bradley all the way up to -125. Gooch is not someone I’m particularly high on when it comes to the derivative markets, but I like him a lot in this matchup. The Oklahoma State product rates out 55th in my 24-round, but there are some positives going in his favor. He was T14 at the Masters and possesses a strong approach game (26th in SG: approach over his last 24 rounds) that will inform success for Gooch at Southern Hills. Additionally, Gooch ranks 19th in the field in SG: total across his last 24 rounds on courses longer than 7400 yards. Noren, meanwhile, is 110th in the former category and doesn’t rate out well in my model. The Swedish international is 94th overall in my 24-round model and 100th overall in my 36-round projection. In terms of the former projection, Noren ranks out 90th in SG: approach and 105th in driving distance. Further, he sits 87th in strokes-gained: Par 4’s. In fact the only category in which Noren ranks higher than 50th in SG: Par 3’s, the least emphasized category. And yet, you’re telling me he wins this matchup almost 60 percent of the time based on his implied odds? I’m simply not buying it. Play Gooch all the way up to -110.
