A possible case of monkeypox was being investigated in New York City after a patient with symptoms arrived at Bellevue Hospital, health officials said Thursday afternoon. The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said their health lab will conduct a preliminary test for monkeypox. If the results are positive the samples will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. The patient is being cared for with all isolation protocols in place at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue. Epidemiologists are expected to follow up with any individual that may have been in contact with the patient while infectious, the health department said. The first case in the US this year was identified Tuesday in Massachusetts. The disease has been found in other countries with more than 60 possible cases identified so far. Monkeypox is rare in the US, the department said. When a positive case is identified, the symptoms include a flu-like illness in addition to swelling of the lymph nodes and followed by a rash on the face and body.
