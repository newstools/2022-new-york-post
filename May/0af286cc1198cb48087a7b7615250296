You’ve heard of Addison Rae and Charli D’Amelio. But what about TikTok’s wealthiest animals? All About Cats released the earnings of the app’s animal accounts Friday, and it’s quite paw-sible that some of its most popular petfluencers make more money than your average bear. At the top of the leaderboard is ThatLittlePuff, a furry gray kitty estimated to earn over $26,400 per post. With 27.6 million followers and over 590 million likes, the cat — with the help of crafty edits by humans — tests recipes and life hacks posted by other users. His videos never get less than 1 million views. In the No. 2 spot is Jiffpom. Even if users don’t follow Jiff, they would probably recognize the puffy-head Pomeranian with a full wardrobe. He holds two Guinness World Records for the fastest pup to walk on two paws, and he made a cameo in Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” music video. With over 20 million followers and 518 million likes, the pint-size Pom earns an estimated $20,600 per TikTok post. And the bronze medal for the most earnings on the platform goes to Chipmunks of TikTok. Dinky, Squishy, Mooshy and SpongeBob are a few of the 25 critters the account’s 13.7 million followers can see stuffing their faces with snacks. These hungry cuties rake in $13,330 per TikTok post, keeping the chipmunks well-fed and whoever runs the account well-paid. TikTok’s highest-paid animals include ThatLittlePuff, Jiffpom, and Chipmunks of TikTok.
