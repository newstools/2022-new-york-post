Fan Controlled Football quarterback Jason Stewart has been cut by the Zappers for smoking a joint during a touchdown celebration. Last week, Stewart lit up what appeared to be a joint on the field, and yelled “Blaze up my friends, blaze up.” Although the FCF does not test for marijuana and “fully supports players’ responsible use of cannabis,” the league said in a statement, Stewart’s smoky celebration occurred in Georgia, where marijuana is illegal. “Jason Stewart was cut from the Zappers for violating league policy,” the FCF said, according to Total Pro Sports. “While the FCF fully supports player’s responsible use of cannabis, unfortunately it is still illegal in the state of Georgia and is banned by our venue and hotel property partners – so our policy of not allowing smoking at these sites is well known by all of our players.” In a separate video on Twitter, Stewart said “Plants over pills,” explaining, “I did it for a reason. If an athlete scores and goes to drink a beer it’s okay, but heaven forbid we hit the gas. Cmon. Let’s think about it.” Stewart appeared to hand the joint to former kicker Donald De La Haye, who said, “That’s the craziest s–t I’ve ever seen.” “This man threw a touchdown, came over, lit the blunt and said, ‘We smoking’ that glacier pack,'” De La Haye said about Stewart. Stewart, meanwhile, shared the clips to his Twitter account and addressed being cut in a tweet. “I’m really amazed how many supporters there have been through out this process!” wrote Stewart, who played college football at Memphis. “The Love has been incredible. Don’t feel bad about me getting cut. I’m doing just fine in life off the field. I hadn’t played in 6 years. Started 4 games, was MVP of 3. Was a blessing to play again.”
