Ever Ready. Pitcher Adam Wainwright and catcher Yadier Molina have won 203 games together and are the most successful batterymates in MLB history. Never Ready. President Joe Biden and his Veep Kamala Harris can’t get a win and a new NBC poll shows the batterymates’ approval rating has reached a new low, 39 percent. The new figure does not account for the little ones waiting for their formula to be restocked. The White House says the crisis will ease and there are indications to suggest they are correct. Baby Bratz Johnny Depp and Amber Heard appear to be well fed.  Sonny Gray has made two limited starts for the Twins since returning from a hamstring injury, allowing two runs over 8 ¹/₃. The former Yankee and Red (gotta be happy about that) deals in Oakland. The A’s send Daulton Jefferies, who was shelled for four quick runs by the Twins in Minnesota on May 8. Taking the Twins for 10 units.  Rocky Mountain High. The Giants built a 10-2 cushion and held on, beating the Rockies 10-7. Both teams hit. Twenty-six the combined tally. Winner. Up +258 mccoveys.
