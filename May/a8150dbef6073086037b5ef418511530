Johnny Depp was greeted with a standing ovation from his fans at Royal Albert Hall in London on Monday night as the actor awaits the verdict in his defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard. Fans rejoiced to see Depp alongside his friend and singer Jeff Beck perform a series of music covers including John Lennon’s “Isolation,” and Marvin Gay’s “What’s Going On,” for the second night in the row. Depp fans took to Instagram and Twitter to share their views of the American actor’s performance on stage. “Johnny is an absolute mad man… leaves court Friday. playing a gig in Sheffield UK Sunday withJeff Beck mind blown,” Twitter user @OneloveEarth said. Meanwhile, the actor’s daughter, Lily-Rose Depp celebrated her 23rd birthday on social media over the weekend. Lily-Rose shared three snapshots — captioned simply, “23!” — to her Instagram feed, including one of a bouquet of flowers and two photos of her wearing a cheerful pink sash that reads “Birthday Princess.” The Depp-Heard trial wrapped with closing arguments on Friday, before heading to the jury for deliberations. The 58-year-old actor and Heard have been battling it out at Fairfax County Courthouse Virginia after Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife over a 2018 op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post, in which she claimed that she was a victim of “domestic abuse” but didn’t identify him. Heard is countersuing him for $100 million. Depp’s team declined to comment when asked if the actor will appear in Fairfax County Courthouse tomorrow as jury deliberations resume.
