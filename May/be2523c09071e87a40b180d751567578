After trading blowouts in the first four games, the series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning is now a best-of-three heading into Tuesday’s Game 5 in Toronto. And although the series scoreboard would suggest this has been a tight contest, the way the games have played out have been anything but tight. In fact, more of this series (106 minutes) has been played with one team up by at least three goals than it has with the score tied or within one goal (79 minutes). Thus, it’s been hard to learn anything new about these two teams and this matchup from their first four games because one of them has been chasing in the contest from the jump. Part of the reason games have not been close is that the goaltending has been less than spectacular. Andrei Vasilevskiy and Jack Campbell have posted similarly pedestrian numbers. But Vasilevskiy has the pedigree of being one of the NHL’s best goaltenders over the last four seasons, while Campbell has been inconsistent for the better part of five months now. He has an .889 save percentage and -1.0 Goals Saved Above Expected in this series. In a game that projects as a coin flip, a plus-money price on Tampa Bay and Vasilevskiy is worth a play. The play: Lightning +110.
