Tiger Woods was playing out of a fairway bunker on the ninth hole at Southern Hills during the third round of the PGA Championship when his shot got stuck in the lip of the bunker. He’d get relief for the ball being embedded in the turf but could only throw up his hands in disgust. It was one of those days for Woods. After grinding to make the cut on Friday, aided by a late birdie and clutch par save, he kept the momentum going with a 13-footer to save par at the first hole on Saturday. It wouldn’t last. Woods bogeyed his next hole after his tee shot found a creek. Four holes later, he found the water again, with his 4-iron coming up well short on the par 3. He went on to make triple-bogey, then added another bogey on the seventh. Things only got worse from there. Beginning on the ninth hole, Woods made five straight bogeys, including one on the par-5 13th, where he hammered a pitch through the green then missed a 7-footer for par. At one point, he was 10-over for the round. Woods finally stanched the bleeding with a ho-hum two-putt par on the par-3 14th, then rolled in a 35-footer for birdie on the par-4 15th for his first red number of the day. It would also be his last. Woods made pars the rest of the way for a 9-pver 79. That drops him to 12-over for the tournament, with any hopes of a weekend rally having been dashed.
