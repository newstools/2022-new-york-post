The victim killed at the Mississippi Mudbug Festival was one of the shooters behind the gunfire that injured five others, authorities said Sunday. Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said the alleged shooter, an unidentified man, was killed by an officer responding to shots fired at the fairgrounds in Jackson on Saturday night, news station WLBT reported. “We believe… that the victim that is deceased was actively involved in the incident that was reported regarding the gunfire,” Jones told reporters. He declined to provide more details about the officer who fatally shot the alleged shooter. “I will not reveal the name or the agency the officer is affiliated with. That is something that will come out… at a later date,” he said. At least six people were shot, including the deceased male victim, Jackson said. “Other victims appear to be stable at this time and don’t appear to be directly involved in the shooting or circumstances that led to the shooting,” Jackson wrote on Twitter. But he said there could be more victims unaccounted for in the mass shooting. “We are still checking other hospitals to see if other individuals had been shot and were transported by private vehicles to other hospitals as well,” he told reporters. At least two people have been taken into custody in connection to the shooting, but several shooters possibly opened fire at the festival, Jones said. The two detained are juveniles. “It’s very devastating and tragic,” Jones said. “This is what is to be considered a family-oriented event, for families from all different walks of life to come to a common location to enjoy entertainment and enjoy food… You have the reckless behavior of individuals with no regard for the lives and safety of those attending the event.” It’s unclear what prompted the shooting, but the investigation is ongoing, Jones said.
