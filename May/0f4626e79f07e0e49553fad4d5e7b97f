Illegal-migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border soared to 234,088 in April, a new record for the Department of Homeland Security, eclipsing the March all-time record by 5.8% — and President Joe Biden’s only plan is to make it worse. Nearly half the April migrants were not from Mexico or the Northern Triangle, by the way. Team Biden is intent on dropping the Trump-era Title 42 rule, which allows the feds to send many migrants back (97,000 in April) over COVID concerns. His minions claim COVID’s no longer an issue on the border (though they still cite it as reason to forgive vast amounts of college loans, among other areas where they conveniently claim the crisis continues). So he’s offering potential migrants more reason to come: a far better chance of being allowed in “temporarily,” even if they’re caught. (Tens of thousands make it through each month without an “encounter.”) And this is just as warmer weather alone guarantees an increase. Border Patrol holding areas are already at 203% capacity; Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, 68.5%. This, more than a year after the prez claimed on the “Today” show that “we’ve now gotten control” of the border, not to mention a host of other empty claims ever since. Title 42 is set to end May 23, unless a federal judge rules otherwise. And if he does, expect Biden & Co. to find something else to deepen the crisis: At this point, their actions make it unmistakable that ever-rising illegal immigration — total open borders — is their true goal.
