Tua Tagovailoa is reputed to not have a particularly strong arm, but his new receiver Tyreek Hill is gushing about it. Hill, who signed with the Dolphins for four years and $120 million after being traded by the Chiefs, spoke to reporters at OTAs on Tuesday. “Tua actually has one of the prettiest balls I’ve ever caught him in my life… Tua is a very accurate QB,” Hill said. “I’m very confident in my QB… the sky is the limit for that guy. Heck of a talent. Has crazy arm strength, arm talent.” Hill spent the last four seasons in Kansas City catching balls from Patrick Mahomes, who has one of the strongest arms in NFL history. In going to Miami, Hill joins Jaylen Waddle as a profoundly speedy wideout duo for Tagovailoa and the Dolphins. Successfully getting the ball to Hill became fodder for critics, though, when the Dolphins tweeted out a hype video two weeks ago in which the quarterback underthrew the wide receiver, who had to stop and wait for the deep ball. On DraftKings, Hill’s over/under totals for this season are 1,099.5 yards and 8.5 touchdowns. These totals are both lower than what Hill accumulated each of the past two seasons, presumably because the market does not have as much faith in Tagovailoa as Hill is communicating at this time.
