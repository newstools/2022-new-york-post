They refused the vaccine. Now four cadets at the Air Force Academy may not graduate as a result — and could be forced to pay back hefty tuition fees. So far it’s the only military academy imposing such harsh penalties on its cadets, Air Force officials said. The cadets at the Colorado Springs academy also could be prevented from being commissioned as military officers this month because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine. They may also have to pay back thousands of dollars in tuition costs, the Air Force said. The Army and Navy said that as of now, no seniors will be blocked from graduating at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., or the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, due to vaccine refusals. The graduation ceremonies are coming up soon: West Point on May 21, the Air Force Academy on May 25 and Annapolis on May 27. COVID-19 vaccinations were made mandatory in August for all service members, including those at the military academies. The Army said in February it would “immediately” start kicking out soldiers who refuse the vaccine. With Post wires
