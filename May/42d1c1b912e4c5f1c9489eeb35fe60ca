President Joe Biden met Monday with the parents of veteran Marine captain who was working as a freelance journalist when captured in Syria in 2012. Biden met with Marc and Debra Tice, parents of Austin Tice, 40, on Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Pskai told media outlets. “During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work through all available avenues to secure Austin’s long overdue return to his family,” the Hill reported. The Tice family did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Marine Corps Times on Tuesday. Debra Tice was introduced Saturday night as being in attendance at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner, where Biden paid tribute in his remarks to journalists who are missing or detained. Biden also said at the event that he wanted to meet with the Tices to speak about their son. Renewed attention to Tice’s case has come following the return of Marine veteran Trevor Reed, 30, who had been held in Russia in a prisoner exchange in recent weeks. Reed had been detained by Russian officials while visiting the country in 2017. He later was convicted based on evidence US Ambassador John Sullivan called “laughable” after allegedly assaulting Russian police officers following a night of drinking.
