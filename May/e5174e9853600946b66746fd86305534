Trevor May won’t pitch for the rest of the month that shares his name and maybe not June either. The Mets reliever has been shut down from throwing for approximately four weeks after imaging revealed a stress reaction in the lower part of his right humerus. Once May resumes throwing he will need a gradual buildup before rejoining the Mets. In eight appearances this season, the right-hander has pitched to an 8.64 ERA and allowed 13 hits in 8 1/3 innings. The Mets recalled Adonis Medina from Triple-A Syracuse earlier in the week to take his spot in the bullpen. “[May] is a big part of our bullpen and we look forward to getting him healthy and back to his former self,” Seth Lugo said. Drew Smith’s emergence in the Mets bullpen leaves him as an obvious candidate to step into the higher leverage roles that had been entrusted to May. In 10 appearances this season Smith has not allowed an earned run. “You can tell he’s walking a little taller right now,” Lugo said. May arrived before last season on a two-year contract worth $15 million. In 68 appearances he pitched to a 3.59 ERA with four saves.
