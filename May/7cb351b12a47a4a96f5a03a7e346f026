The 18-year-old boy from Maine who died when the hole he and his sister were digging in the sand at the Jersey Shore Tuesday collapsed on them was remembered by his devastated dad as “quirky” and true to himself. Levi Cavelry, 18, was pronounced dead after being pulled from the gaping pit at Toms River’s Ocean Beach 3. His 17-year-old sister was injured in the sand collapse but survived. “Levi was himself,” his father, Todd Cavelry, said in a statement sent to The Post Wednesday. “He was odd. He was quirky. He was not real concerned with what others thought.” The dad also said Levi was a devout Christian and “knew Jesus Christ.” The teen was very involved in church activities and played the drums in a young adult worship band. According to the elder Cavelry, his son was a “tech nut” and loved computer programming “The truth is that Scripture says that all our days are numbered,” Todd added. “That there is nothing we can do to add a single hour to our life. He knew that.” Toms River police told The Post that Levi and his younger sister had dug a deep hole while spending time at the beach during their trip to New Jersey. At around 4 p.m., the hole caved in on the siblings, crushing Levi to death and trapping his sister, police said. It took first responders more than two-and-a-half hours to pull Levi’s body out of the sand, according to officials. The Cavelry family lives in Union, Maine. Dad Todd Cavelry works as an architectural photographer. Mom Angela Caverly is a buyer at an electronics company, according to her Facebook page. This is not the first time that a sand collapse on a New Jersey beach has led to an emergency situation. In July 2020, a boy was rescued from a sand hole in Belmar by a group of cops, firefighters and lifeguards. In August 2015, a similar incident took place in Surf City, when a 12-year-old boy was pulled to safety from a caved-in hole in the sand.
