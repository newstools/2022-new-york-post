Tom Brady is “excited” about his post-NFL future. Moments after Fox Sports announced Tuesday that the Buccaneers quarterback would become the network’s lead analyst following the conclusion of his playing career, Brady addressed the upcoming opportunity on Twitter. “Excited, but a lot of unfinished business on the field with the @Buccaneers #LFG,” he wrote. Brady will work alongside Kevin Burkhardt whenever he decides to call it a career — again. The seven-time Super Bowl champ initially revealed in February that he’d be stepping away from the game after 22 seasons. Forty days later, however, Brady confirmed that he’d be returning to the Buccaneers for another year. “These past two months I have realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands. That time will come. But it’s not now,” Brady posted on social media in March. “I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. Without them, none of this is possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. We have unfinished business.” The Buccaneers were bounced from the playoffs in January following a divisional-round loss to the now-Super Bowl champion Rams. Tampa Bay had won the Super Bowl a year prior in February 2021 with a 31-9 victory over the Chiefs. Although it remains to be seen when the Brady-Burkhardt team will officially make its debut, the duo has some big shoes to fill following the offseason departures of longtime Fox analysts Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Buck and Aikman, who had been the network’s lead broadcast team, joined ESPN earlier this year and will slide into the “Monday Night Football” booth beginning in September.
