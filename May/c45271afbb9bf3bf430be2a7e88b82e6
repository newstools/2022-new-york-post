The hate-fueled teen who fatally shot 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket apparently scrawled the name of a woman slain in the Waukesha parade rampage on his gun — adding, ”Here’s your reparations,’’ according to Post law-enforcement sources and reports. Photos emerged of the rifle used by Payton Gendron, 18, that appear to show the misspelled name of Virginia Sorenson, as well as that of a possible other parade victim, on its barrel, the Daily Beast said. Gendron added the n-word and, “Here’s your reparations” on the firearm, sources told The Post. Gendron is an alleged white supremacist who targeted a predominantly black neighborhood for Saturday’s massacre. Of the 13 people he blasted, 11 were black, officials said. Sorenson, a 79-year-old white woman, was one of six people killed during a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisc., last year when a black man plowed his SUV into a crowd of celebrants. Suspected killer Darrell Edward Brooks endorsed attacking whites on social media before the horror. Authorities said that before Gendron’s slaughter, the teen wrote a 180-page manifesto focusing on the “great replacement” theory that argues immigrants are being purposefully brought into America to skew electoral results. Gendron, who shot 13 people at the Tops Friendly Supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday afternoon, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges and is expected to face additional raps as prosecutors ready their case against him. Authorities called him a loner who became radicalized online during the early days of the pandemic.
