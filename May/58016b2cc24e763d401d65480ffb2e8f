Cardinal Timothy Dolan made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday. The Catholic archbishop of New York posted a video to Twitter from Lviv in western Ukraine. “We didn’t know for sure if we’d be able to get here, but — thanks be to God — we were able to leave Poland yesterday and come here to Ukraine,” said Dolan, who has been touring refugee and aid facilities in neighboring Poland and Slovakia. While in Ukraine, Dolan said, he has met with several internally displaced Ukrainians, including a 94-year-old woman from the Donbas region and a family that fled Mariupol. The United Nations estimates about 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine by the fighting. Alongside video showing pallets of donated fresh water, Dolan beseeched his social-media followers to continue donating goods and money to relief efforts in Ukraine. “I have to pass it on to you, because I’ve heard it again and again,” he tweeted. ” ‘Tell the folks of the United States how grateful we are for their help.’ “
