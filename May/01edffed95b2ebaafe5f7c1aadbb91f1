Avoca-don’t try this at home. A viral TikTok hack showing how to keep avocados fresh for weeks by using water and refrigeration can actually breed salmonella along with other harmful bacterias, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The once easy (and now queasy) trick was demonstrated on TikTok by user @shamamamahealing, who displayed a two-week-old avocado that did not morph into its usual brownish-black goop. The mom of four boasted that the “magic” method of storing the unopened fruit in a container of water could have it last “in the fridge for up to a month.” But the FDA says don’t put these water-cooled ‘cados in your guac. “The FDA does not recommend this practice,” an agency spokesperson told Newsweek. “The main concern is with the possibility that any residual human pathogens (i.e., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, etc.) that may be residing on the avocado surface may potentially multiply during the storage when submerged in water.” The agency has also done its own testing and avocados come back in worse shape, despite keeping their hulkish green looks. “In addition, research performed by FDA scientists has shown that Listeria monocytogenes has the potential to infiltrate and internalize into the pulp of avocados when submerged in refrigerated dump tanks within 15 days during refrigerated storage. In this case, even surface disinfecting the avocado skin prior to slicing would not be able to remove the contamination.” Studying 1,615 avocados, the FDA found Listeria monocytogenes — a bacteria notably harmful to pregnant women, seniors and those with weakened immune systems — in 17.73% of the study sample, according to Newsweek. Dunking them into water for long periods of time exacerbates the chances for the bacteria to multiply, the outlet added.
