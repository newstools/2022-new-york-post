LAS VEGAS — Shakur Stevenson was the headline in his main event win over Oscar Valdez on Saturday night, but Muhammad Ali’s grandson put on a show, too. On the main undercard, Nico Ali Walsh (5-0, 4 KOs) needed just 2 minutes, 50 seconds to knock out Alejandro Ibarra (7-2) in what was supposed to be a four-round middleweight special attraction. After standing toe-to-toe for much of the round, and continually landing his right hook to Ibarra’s head, Ali Walsh set up his outmatched opponent. After feinting with his right hand to open things up, Ali Walsh landed a quick left and a devastating right flush on Ibarra’s face for his fourth career knockout. “This is just a testament to all the work I put in,” Ali Walsh said. “This is bigger than boxing. This is for my family. “I’m bringing my grandpa back to life, and that’s why mom gets so emotional because she’s seeing her dad again and hearing her dad’s name to me.”
