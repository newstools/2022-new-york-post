Soap opera actress Marnie Schulenburg is dead after losing her battle with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. She was 37. She died Tuesday in a hospital in Bloomfield, New Jersey, her representative told The Hollywood Reporter. Schulenburg is best known for her roles as Alison Stewart on CBS’ “As the World Turns” and Jo Sullivan on the “One Life to Live” reboot. She also guest-starred or recurred on such shows as “Blue Bloods,” “Fringe,” “Royal Pains,” “Army Wives,” “Divorce” and “The Good Fight.” Most recently, she played the recurring role of Maggie Caysen on the Showtime drama “City on a Hill,” with Season 3 premiering in July. She was released from the hospital on Mother’s day to spend time with her family, SheKnows Soaps reported. Schulenburg leaves behind her 2-year-old daughter, Coda, whom she shares with her husband, “Succession” actor Zack Robidas. “Please don’t say Marnie lost her battle to cancer. It’s simply not true. I watched her kick cancer’s ass everyday since diagnosis,” Robidas reportedly said in a Facebook post, according to Variety. “She is incredible. We chose to attack her diagnosis with blind optimism. We only talked about the future and continued moving forward. I don’t know if this was right but it’s all we knew how to do.” “I know that me being here for [Coda] is the best gift I can give her,” she wrote recently on Facebook, according to the SheKnows Soaps report. “But right now, it feels like settling since she’s getting a half-life version of myself. My mother showed up 100 percent all day every day for me growing up, or at least it seemed that way. I want to give Coda the same, but I must be kind to myself and remember that nothing is permanent.” The Massachusetts native was diagnosed five months after her daughter’s birth in December 2019, according to the Reporter.
