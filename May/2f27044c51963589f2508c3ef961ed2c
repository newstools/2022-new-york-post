A former McDonald’s employee has revealed what happens when you don’t properly cook the fast-food restaurant’s famous nuggets – and it’s pretty gross. Despite that, he said he’d still eat them. Taking to social media, Christian W. Poole, who allegedly worked at the fast-food chain, said on TikTok: “I want this to be public knowledge. “So I worked at a McDonald’s for close to two years so I’ve done my time but for the last year I worked at McDonald’s, I was a cook. “I’ve made plenty of McDonald’s food – all of it is pretty simple, I mean, it’s all kinda bad for you but the process of cooking it is pretty normal, except for one f–king item, which happens to be my favorite: Chicken McNuggets.” He explained that the nuggets are already pre-packaged and frozen until needed. In order to cook them, all you need to do is dump them in a fryer, which then goes into hot oil. “However, if a nugget gets like half-cooked in the oil and half still frozen, it will puss around the seam of cooked and not cooked,” he claimed. “That’s right, puss! They’re tasty though, so I’d still eat them if I’m honest.” The US Sun has reached out to Mcdonald’s for comment but didn’t receive any at the time of publication. However, McNuggets aren’t the only ones who react this way to being half-cooked. A Burger King employee claimed that the same thing happens to their nuggets if not cooked properly. Many people, however, expressed their disgust with one person saying: “WHY WOULD YOU SAY THIS?? “WHY DID YOU DECIDE THIS SHOULD BE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE?” A second one wrote: “I worked there in the late 90s. There’s nothing there I wouldn’t eat but my desire to eat at McDonald’s went way down after those two and a half years.” And a third expressed their desire to “unwatch” the video. Nonetheless, many still didn’t care and claimed they’d still eat them. Would you still eat a half-cooked McNugget? This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
