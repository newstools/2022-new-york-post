Leave it to MLB fans to do the heavy lifting when it comes to getting to the bottom of the fantasy-football-ignited feud between Joc Pederson and Tommy Pham. After Pederson revealed to reporters Saturday an image of the GIF that he sent in a text message group chat for a fantasy football league last year poking fun at the 2021 San Diego Padres’ late-season collapse, Twitter sleuths found the video for all to see. As promised, there are three weight-lifters – one representing the San Francisco Giants, one representing the Los Angeles Dodgers and one representing the Padres – who throw a heavy item in the air during the short clip. The Giants and Dodgers escape unharmed, while the Padres’ weightlifter is knocked to the ground after the item lands on her head. The meaning isn’t hard to decipher. The National League West Division was a three-horse race for the first half of last season, before Pham’s Padres collapsed and finished an astonishing 28 games behind the first-place Giants. The Dodgers finished one game back and earned a wild-card berth. Pederson, who won a World Series with the Braves last season, played for the Dodgers from 2014-20. He said he has friends on the Padres who are in the fantasy football league and understood that he was joking. Pham, a self-proclaimed high-stakes gambler, is not one of them, apparently. Both players changed teams again in the offseason, but Pham used the first meeting between his Reds and Pederson’s Giants to slap Pederson in the face for what he interpreted as disrespect and settle an eight-month-old grudge. Pederson also alleged that Pham quit the fantasy league during the season, which is a major no-no. Pham received a three-game MLB suspension for the slap. There is no word yet of any penalty imposed by the fantasy league commissioner.
