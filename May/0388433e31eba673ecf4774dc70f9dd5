Kumar Rocker’s next move has been revealed. The Mets’ former first-round pick is joining the independent Frontier League, where he’ll pitch for the Tri-City Valleycats of Troy, New York, The Post’s Jon Heyman reported Friday. Rocker, a right-hander out of Vanderbilt, was selected 10th overall by the Mets in last year’s draft. The two parties failed to reach an agreement last summer, as there was concern over Rocker’s elbow, leaving the 22-year-old unsigned. Rocker did not return to the Commodores and will now have the opportunity to showcase his skill set again. He’ll be eligible for the 2022 MLB Draft, which gets underway in July. The Mets and Rocker reportedly had a draft-day arrangement of a $6 million signing bonus. The Mets apparently had concerns about Rocker’s health following a physical. Rocker’s advisor, Scott Boras, noted in a statement at the time that the player is “healthy.” “Immediately upon conclusion of his collegiate season, he had an MRI on both his shoulder and his elbow. When compared with his 2018 MRIs, the medical experts found no significant change. Kumar requires no medical attention and will continue to pitch in the regular course as he prepares to begin his professional career,” Boras said. Boras said in November that Rocker was “looking great,” adding, “[He’s] throwing great and we think somebody is going to be very lucky and someone may be very unlucky as to how things turn out for Kumar Rocker.” The Mets, meanwhile, will receive a compensatory supplemental pick for Rocker after the 10th selection in this year’s draft.
