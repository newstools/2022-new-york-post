A brute was caught on camera punching an elderly man and kicking him in the face after he fell to the ground outside an apartment building in the Bronx Monday afternoon. The shocking show of violence was preceded by a verbal argument between the 77-year-old victim and the much younger unidentified ruffian in front of 1299 Grand Concourse at about 1:30 p.m., according to cops. Surveillance footage of the physical attack, released by the NYPD, shows the suspect punch the man in the face, which immediately knocks the victim to the ground. As the victim puts his cane in a defensive position, his attacker tosses the contents of a red plastic cup at him and kicks him in the face, according to the footage. The attacker also tried to rob the man, but left empty-handed, police said. The victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition, according to the NYPD. The suspect was wearing a black and red Tommy Hilfiger jacket, and a black hooded sweatshirt with black track pants and sneakers. He was seen casually walking away after delivering the beating and remained at large Tuesday night, police said.
