The Great One is also great at crushing beers. Wayne Gretzky, now 61, still parties deep into the night, according to his TNT NHL colleague, Paul Bissonnette. “After these broadcasts, sometimes we go to Wayne’s room until like 4-5 in the morning,” Bissonnette said on “The Pat McAfee Show” earlier this week. “This guy is the biggest guy’s guy. He will crush beers. He will tell me all these iconic stories. Buddy, it’s a dream come true and that alone is incentive enough for me to fly out here once or twice a week and do this gig — just to hear these stories from the greatest hockey player of all-time.” Bissonnette, who played in the NHL from 2009 through 2014 and co-hosts the popular “Spittin’ Chiclets” hockey podcast on Barstool Sports, recalled that when he played for the Coyotes he became friends with Gretzky’s sons, Ty and Trevor. They went to Arizona State and threw huge parties at the family mansion in the Phoenix area every weekend. “We would have home games on Saturday. We would go to the bar, and then we’d go back to his place. Let’s just put it this way: I was batting a thousand at this place. The girls were just everywhere. It was insane,” Bissonnette said. He revealed that Gretzky’s sons “vouched” for him and told the Great One that he’d help the TNT studio broadcast. From there, Gretzky “put in a good word” for him. Bissonnette concluded: “I’ve really got to thank Ty and Trevor for the introduction — and also for helping me get laid.”
