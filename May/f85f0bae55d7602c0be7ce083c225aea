Denver Nuggets star center Nikola Jokic has reportedly been voted the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for a second straight season. A formal announcement is expected sometime this week, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Jokic, 27, averaged career highs this past regular season, with 27.1 points and 13.8 rebounds per game. His 7.9 assists per game this were the eighth-best number in the league. The three-time All-Star became the first player in NBA history with 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 500 assists in a season. He led the league in player efficiency rating (32.8), per Basketball Reference. Jokic’s season ended when the Warriors eliminated the Nuggets in five games in their first-round playoff series. The star center led Denver to the postseason without the team’s two max contract players in point guard Jamal Murray and forward Michael Porter Jr. Murray sat out the entire season after suffering a torn ACL in April 2021. Porter Jr. played nine games this season after having lumbar spine surgery. Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo was a finalist for this year’s NBA MVP award, along with Sixers big man Joel Embiid. This marks the fourth consecutive season an international player has won the NBA’s MVP award. Jokic, a native of Serbia, is the 14th player in NBA history to win the MVP multiple times and the second straight winner to go back-to-back after Antetokounmpo did. The “Greek Freak” won consecutive MVP awards in 2018-19 and 2019-20. Jokic also is the lowest-drafted player to ever win the NBA MVP award. He was a second round pick (No. 41) by the Nuggets in the 2014 NBA Draft.
