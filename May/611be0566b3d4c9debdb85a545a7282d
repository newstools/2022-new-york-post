One single New Yorker insists every woman should have a “red flag detector” in her dating profile – and hers is being hailed as “brilliant.” In her Hinge profile, Brooklyn singleton Samantha DeBardelaben offers up “Two Truths and a Lie” to prospective dates, and if they choose incorrectly, she immediately knows if they are sexist. “I think it’s crucial that every woman with a dating app has some kind of red flag detector,” Samantha said in a TikTok video that’s racked up 2.5 million views. “Mine on my Hinge profile is my ‘Two Truths and a Lie,'” she went on. Her three statements are: “I have an extra toe,” “My mom is a rocket scientist,” and “I have a sibling with the same name.” “It’s outrageous, right? It’s pretty good. It’s a tough one. People tend to get stumped,” she said. “But I will tell you, the number of men who believe that I have an extra toe or that I have a sibling with the same name and think that my mom being a rocket scientist is the lie? “Red flag. Immediate red flag. And I send that to them. That’s all the response that they get from me,” she said. “Men will really out themselves before the conversation has even begun,” she added in the caption. Samantha said she gets especially riled up by men who find it outlandish that her mother could be a rocket scientist because she grew up hearing the sexist assumptions made about her mom. Whenever her mother would wear clothing from her prestigious alma mater, strangers would ask if her son or husband went to that school. “They never asked if her daughter went, they never asked her if she went,” Samantha said. TikTok commenters have applauded Samantha’s clever prompt. “I approve of this system, this is great,” wrote one, while others called it “amazing” and “so smart.” “Absolutely support this, didn’t even consider your mom being a rocket scientist as the lie,” wrote another. “This is genius (like your mom!),” wrote a third.
