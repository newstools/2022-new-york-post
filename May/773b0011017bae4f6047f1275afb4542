Getting ready for Monday night’s Met Gala is proving quite a feet for Mayor Eric Adams. The Ferragamo-loving pol took time out of his busy schedule in the afternoon to treat himself to a pedicure ahead of the city’s fashion event of the year. Video posted on Twitter showed Hizzoner barefoot in the beauty chair at Cuccio Nail Salon in Washington Heights, Manhattan, while one of the staff washed his feet. “The Met Ball — so we’ll make sure I have a pedi done before I go,” Adams quips in the short clip. A City Hall spokesman confirmed that Adams received the pedicure before 2 p.m. — adding that the mayor did not have his nails painted. Hizzoner has “been dying to go” to the A-list fashion function “for years,” a longtime pal previously told The Post. “Whatever [Adams is] planning to [wear] will be fabulous, and it won’t be a conventional pinstripe suit,” the source added. The City Hall rep said Adams would wear “a very nice suit.”
