Before game two between the Golden State Warriors and Dallas Mavericks tips off at 9:00 p.m. ET on TNT, Brandon Anderson of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The Warriors claimed the opening game 112-87, its second straight win by double-digits in the playoffs. Tonight, Anderson likes the Warriors but with a specific angle in mind. Rather than backing the Warriors spread for the whole game, Anderson is choosing to lay one-and-a-half points in the third quarter with the hosts. “The Warriors take care of business in the third quarter,” Anderson says. “That’s what we saw in In game one, where the Warriors won the third quarter by 10 points.” That’s indicative of a larger trend for the Warriors in the postseason. So far, Golden State is 7-0 straight up at home with a +16 net rating, but that rating goes up quite a bit in the second half. Across those seven games, the Warriors’ net rating in the second half goes up to north of +22. Additionally, the Mavericks tend to struggle away from home in the second half. So far this postseason, Dallas owns a -11.5 net rating in the second half away from Dallas after generally playing pretty evenly in the first half. Anderson believes the Mavericks will have a strong opening half and hang tough with Golden State, but that tired legs will continue to show as the Warriors rip open the game beginning with the third quarter.  For those reasons, lay the point-and-a-half with the Warriors as it seeks to win the frame for the second straight contest.
