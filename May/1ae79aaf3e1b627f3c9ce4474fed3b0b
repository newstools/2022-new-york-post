After over a century in the same family, this Upper East Side stunner is ready for some new blood. Two blocks from Central Park, this five-story Italianate brownstone has been occupied by the same brood since 1907. Now, though, for the first time in 115 years, that could change, as the property is freshly listed for $13 million. “This is one of the very best blocks on the Upper East Side, and a house in this location so rarely comes to market,” listing agent Kristi Ambrosetti of Sotheby’s International Realty told The Post. “For those who love prewar details such as pocket doors and original woodwork throughout, this house offers all of that and more.” Designed by the architect Charles Graham circa 1884, the approximately 5,000-square-foot townhouse at 38 East 70th St. features six bedrooms, four-and-a-half baths and an abundance of original details that have been “painstakingly restored and maintained,” Ambrosetti added. There are three skylights, eight fireplaces, restored original woodwork, crown moldings, embrasured shutters and plenty of bay windows with northern and southern exposures throughout, as well as modern conveniences including central air, communication and alarm systems. The home opens to a foyer which leads to a grand parlor level with 12-foot ceilings and a formal gallery, living room, sitting room and dining room with butler’s pantry and dumbwaiter. The kitchen is on the garden level, as are the breakfast room, den, powder room and a small, private garden. There are two bedrooms and one bath each on the upper three levels, and in the basement are storage, laundry and a fifty-case wine cellar. The home is located within the Upper East Side Historic District just a few blocks from where one stool pigeon recently landed in a crappy situation after allegedly pooping in a condo building’s pool. The defecation disaster is currently the subject of a lawsuit filed this month in New York State Supreme Court.
