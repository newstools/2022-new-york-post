The Penguins might get back their No. 1 center and their first-string goalie for Game 7 against the Rangers. Injured captain Sidney Crosby and netminder Tristan Jarry both participated in practice Saturday, and Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan did not rule out either or both playing in the series-deciding game Sunday night at the Garden. “We’ll take each day as it comes,” Sullivan told reporters. “I’m not going to speculate at this point. They’re obviously on the ice. At this point, that’s encouraging. They’re making progress.” Crosby sat out Game 6, which the Rangers won 5-3 Friday night in Pittsburgh with a reported concussion following a hit by defenseman Jacob Trouba in Game 5. The two-time Hart Trophy winner skated on his own before Game 6, then rejoined his teammates on the ice Saturday. “I think anytime he’s on the ice, it’s good for our team, it’s good for our players, it’s good for our morale. That’s certainly a boost for our guys,” Sullivan said. Jarry hasn’t played since April 14 due to a reported fractured foot. Third-stringer Louis Domingue has started the past five games after replacing injured backup Casey DeSmith in the second of three overtime periods in the series opener.

Coach Gerard Gallant said the Rangers “expect Sid to play” Sunday and believe Jarry’s return is “a possibility.” Forward Tyler Motte had two hits and a plus-1 rating in 9:32 of ice-time (2:11 on the penalty kill) in his first appearance since April 7 after suffering an upper-body injury. “Great, excellent. Everything we needed,” Gallant said.
