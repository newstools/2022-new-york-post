Jake Sanford’s new team has his back. The 24-year-old outfielder joined the Ottawa Titans of the Frontier League after being cut by the Yankees on May 12 for allegedly stealing from his teammates. His Ontario-based team believes Sanford has paid his dues amid the alleged scandal. “Jacob Sanford made us aware of the allegations against him and has already paid dearly for it,” the club said in a statement about the Nova Scotia native. “The Ottawa Titans Baseball Organization will supply him with all the necessary tools to ensure his path to being the player and person he wishes to be. The club, player and the league will have no further comment on these allegations.” Sanford — whom the Yankees took in the third round of the 2019 MLB Draft — was released by New York last week after a team investigation found Sanford had stolen from teammates, including equipment that he would then try to sell online, a source confirmed to The Post’s Dan Martin. The news was first reported by NJ Advance Media. Sanford allegedly accepted money from prospective buyers for the equipment then failed to deliver the products, the source added. Sanford has played in five games for the Titans since joining the team, going 5-for-19 with two home runs and three RBIs. Ottawa’s record currently stands at 5-4. The lefty-hitting Sanford split last season between Low-A Tampa and High-A Hudson Valley, and hit a combined 16 homers and finished an .823 OPS. He made his professional debut in the 2019 season, before the 2020 minor league season was canceled due to COVID-19. The Titans begin a three-game series against the Evansville Otters on Tuesday at home.
