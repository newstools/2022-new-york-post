While staying warm and comfortable in the pajamas and loungewear sets is our jam, there’s nothing quite like a solid jumpsuit. The head-to-toe ensemble not only is the ideal throw-on while running late to work (we’ve all been there) but they’re also super stylish and can be dressed up or down. From strapless and wide-leg to ruffled and belted, it’s extraordinary how versatile they come, too. They’re great to stash in your wardrobe as a go-to option next to your favorite cocktail dresses, rompers and matching sets. We adore styles from Lulus and Revolve, specifically, but there are so many brands to choose from. Jumpsuits are great for wineries (especially those dreamy burgundy selects) and optimal for your 9-to-5 if tightly fitting business pants are not your thing (though, we do love our list of the best work pants for women). What’s more, any of these dreamy selects would be wonderful paired the best nude heels we listed or the most comfortable heels you’ll find. Ahead, find the best places to buy jumpsuits from, along with our top 30 selections for 2022. These styles will have you movin’ and groovin’ in pure bliss — in the most seamless fit around. Let’s start off with the retailer that offers practically everything, from best-selling products to grocery store items. Its valor extends to women’s jumpsuits, too, with popular selects we can’t get over. From Amazon’s best-selling Happy Sailed Jumpsuit ($20) to its Pink Queen Button-Up Jumpsuit ($39), the styles will take you from your office to after-office drinks in a snap. We also adore Zesica’s Strapless Wide-Leg Jumpsuit ($34) for a summertime-ready outfit that’s much like your favorite wide-leg pants, along with Amazon Essentials’ Terry Fleece Jumpsuit ($16) for an around-the-house, casual one-piece. Truthfully, we turn to Revolve for the cutest — yet ultra-sophisticated — styles (including its Wedding Shop for some bridal glam). Much like our favorite bodysuits and white dresses, the brand offers some lovely jumpsuits to choose from if a seamless fit is what you’re after. For a wardrobe basic, we 100% recommend Superdown’s Victoria Ruffle Jumpsuit ($74) — an all-black, cropped-leg jumper we love styling with our favorite denim jackets. If you love loungewear but don’t want to think too much about getting ready, L’Academie’s Cohen Jumpsuit ($198) is a sweet splurge. What’s more, we feel pretty in pink with Pistola’s Grover Jumpsuit ($168) that has more of a utilitarian fit. Two other favorites? Pick up Norma Kamali’s KamaliKulture Rectangle Jog Jumpsuit ($145) or Amanda Uprichard’s Zahara Jumpsuit ($242) for a sexy plunging black number or a winery-ready one-piece, respectively. All hail Lulus for the cutest women’s fashions (seriously, just check our wardrobes for proof). From the home of the cutest work pants for women — and cocktail dresses — here’s the scoop on our favorite jumpsuits. For something stunning and chic, Lulus’ Power of Love Emerald Green Strapless Jumpsuit ($68) and Out Tonight Magenta Two-Piece Jumpsuit ($88) won’t let you down. If you’re seeking something more casual, add Lulus’ Raine Washed Red Print Strapless Jumpsuit ($60) to your cart. What’s more, Lulus’ Views of Vacation White Multi Floral Lace-Up Two-Piece Jumpsuit ($78) — as its name suggests — is ideal for vacation resort wear. Plus, the brand’s Turn Up the Temp White Sleeveless Wide-Leg Jumpsuit ($55, original price: $68) is a closet staple. Some say SHEIN can be hit or miss, but we definitely think it’s a hit as far as women’s jumpsuits go. For one, how can you resist the brand’s Surplice Neck Ruffle Belted Wide-Leg Jumpsuit ($18) in its powder-blue valor? But, onto even more. We love the Butterfly Sleeve Wide-Leg Belted Jumpsuit ($21) for a simplistic, delicate outfit that’s bound to collect dozens of compliments. If you’re into all things emerald, the brand’s Knot Shoulder Belted Cami Jumpsuit ($19) is clean and sophisticated for any type of wear. Wanting to grab something versatile for work and outdoor parties alike? Look no further than SHEIN’s Mock-Neck Ruffle Cuff Belted Jumpsuit ($19) and the Allover Floral One-Shoulder Jumpsuit ($16) for girly, pretty-in-patterns ensembles. There’s a reason those little, medium and large brown bags have a universal following — the designer department knows what’s up, especially in the realm of women’s jumpsuits. We adore the flattering, sexy fit of Bardot’s Cut-Out Jumpsuit ($139), which resembles some of this year’s hottest cut-out dresses we rounded up. For a similar wide-leg design, AQUA’s Floral Print Jumpsuit ($78) has adorable tie-string straps and is less than $100. If you want to turn heads, you’ll pick up BCBGMaxazria’s Pleated Jumpsuit ($358) for a punchy coral splurge that’s ideal for a fancy dinner or wedding. We also approve of Paige’s Anessa Belted Denim Jumpsuit ($259) for a timeless take on your favorite jeans. Enter the boho side of jumpsuits: the whimsical prints, loose cotton and linen fabrics and unbeatable, flowy fits. Starting with Free People’s best-selling Homecoming Jumper ($78), this vacation-esque, stretchy one-piece comes in a moody mauve color, among other hues we’re obsessing over. Its Leona Jumpsuit ($128) is similar, offering a bikini-like, string-tie top with an adorable beach-y print. If you’re into the coverall trend, Free People’s Quinn Coveralls ($148) are a supreme option, with a relaxed silhouette and drawstring middle. Not to mention, the brand’s Bali Citrus Skies One-Piece ($148) makes us want to become salsa dancers. Much like Anthropologie’s whimsical and eclectic home decor (take a look at its mirrors and coupe glasses for proof), its jumpsuit selection is top-tier and top-notch. Starting off with some Costa Rican-flair, Farm Rio’s Printed Linen Jumpsuit ($180) is a rose-embossed, puff-sleeve design that’s bound to be one of your most cherished. Similarly, Traffic People’s Jumpsuit ($160) is the royal blue and white, baggy fit you need — for any occasion, TBH. Oh, and to celebrate the warmer temps, we’re all about Anthropologie’s Picnic Jumpsuit ($198), a unique, collared approach to a one-piece outfit. Not to mention, it pairs well with this season’s best picnic essentials. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
