After the sudden passing of Naomi Judd over the weekend, fellow country music singer Dolly Parton paid tribute to her dear friend. “We were very similar. We were the same age and both Capricorns. We loved big hair, makeup and music,” she wrote in a heartfelt Instagram post, calling Naomi’s daughters Ashley and Wynonna her “sisters.” “Congratulations Wynonna for you and your mom being inducted into the Hall of Fame yesterday,” Parton, 76, continued. “I am sorry I couldn’t be there but I can hear Naomi saying now, ‘Oh well, a day late and a Dolly short.'” She ended her note with her iconic signature, complete with a butterfly at the end of her name, concluding her message with: “Just know that I will always love you.” Both Naomi and Wynonna were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame Sunday, following Naomi’s passing, reportedly caused by suicide. At the induction ceremony, Ashley and Wynonna appeared, tearing up as they spoke on behalf of their late mother. “I didn’t prepare anything tonight because I knew mom would probably talk the most,” Wynonna, 57, said. “I’m gonna make this fast, because my heart’s broken, and I feel so blessed. It’s a very strange dynamic, to be this broken and this blessed.” “My mama loved you so much — and I’m sorry that she couldn’t hang on until today,” Ashley, 54, added. Fellow country music star Parton was recently nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, despite previously thinking she hadn’t “earned the right” to be amongst the other famed musicians. “I’ll accept gracefully,” she said. “I’ll say ‘thanks’ and accept that.”
