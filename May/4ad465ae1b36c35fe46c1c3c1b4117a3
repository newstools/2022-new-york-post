Bullets flew during a fight on a Manhattan subway Sunday morning — but nobody was struck, cops said. Multiple shots were fired on the No. 6 subway at East 116th Street and Lexington Avenue in East Harlem during a dispute between two groups of men around 3 a.m., cops said. “Someone let rounds off,” a police spokesman said. “Nobody was struck.” Police found multiple shell casings on the subway platform but believe the shooting took place on the train, cops said. The shooter fled the station and was not apprehended, cops said.
