Joe Douglas has turned the Jets roster around pretty remarkably over the past year. While the record with Douglas as GM is a rough 13-36, this team seems to be turning a corner. On paper, this team looks like it can at least be in the hunt for a playoff spot, which was a pipe dream the past few years. The rebuild is being done right. On a special edition of the “Gang’s All Here” podcast with Brian Costello and me, we were joined by Douglas. He chats with us about their draft picks, Zach Wilson, the future of the team and more.
