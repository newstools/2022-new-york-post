Damian Lillard was the biggest star at the 2022 NBA Draft lottery in Chicago — but he probably had the worst night. The Blazers guard reacted in horror as Portland dropped to the seventh pick in the draft. The team spent most of the second half of the season tanking, spectacularly winning two of its final 23 games. Portland traded away shooting guard CJ McCollum to the Pelicans at the deadline, while Lillard missed all but 29 games due to a severe abdominal injury. The Blazers had the sixth-best odds to land the top pick in the draft but instead slid back one spot. The Kings were the beneficiary, jumping up from seventh to fourth. Lillard tilted his head back in frustration before producing a wry smile. Kings star Damontas Sabonis had the opposite reaction, giving an excited smile at his franchise’s luck. Their fellow representatives on the dais had a good laugh at the diverse reaction of the two NBA stars that were seated next to each other. The Magic earned the No. 1 pick, with the Thunder, Rockets, and Kings behind them. The 2022 NBA Draft gets underway in June.
