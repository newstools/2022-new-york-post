The Philadelphia 76ers find themselves in a tough spot without Joel Embiid, who remains out with a right orbital fracture and concussion. Philadelphia scored just 92 points on 101.5 points per possession in their Game 1 loss to the Miami Heat, and while many think this team is dead, it feels as if they left some meat on the bone offensively. The 76ers could benefit by pushing the pace more and playing small with James Harden, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, Tobias Harris and Georges Niang. They also come off a game in which they shot an abysmal 6 of 34 (17.6 percent) from behind the arc, so we can expect some positive regression in that area. Maxey was just 6 of 15 (40 percent) and Harden 5 of 13 (38.5 percent) from the field. I’m expecting a better performance from the 76ers’ stars in Game 2.  Even with offensive regression from the 76ers, I can’t back this team again with their defense having problems stopping the Heat. DeAndre Jordan was a -22 in 17 minutes, allowing the Heat to essentially hold a layup line during his time on the court. I’ll play the Over 207.5 in what should be a higher scoring affair on Wednesday. The play: 76ers-Heat Over 207.5
