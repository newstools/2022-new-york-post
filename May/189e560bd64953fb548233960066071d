There’s a 100% chance it’s raining creepy men. Amanda Seyfried told Marie Claire that the interactions she had with male fans after “Mean Girls” came out were anything but fetch. The actress said men would approach her and ask if it was raining, as her character Karen Smith believed she could tell the forecast by holding her breasts. “I always felt really grossed out by that,” Seyfried said. “I was like 18 years old. It was just gross.” She also recalled the early fear of being typecast as the “the pretty blonde” in every future role after the cult classic’s release, a bullet she dodged by joining HBO’s “Big Love.” Seyfried added, “I remember for one movie — I can’t say the name — it was between me and some model for a kind of ancillary character. And I was like, ‘Oh God, it doesn’t matter who it is! And if it doesn’t matter, I don’t know if I want to be a part of it.’ But at the same time, I wanted to work, and I wanted to work with the actors involved. Luckily, I then had opportunities that went a different way pretty quickly, and I’m grateful for that.”
