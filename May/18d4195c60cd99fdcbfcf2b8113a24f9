A 73-year-old woman was killed and eight others hurt in a massive blaze at a Bronx home Tuesday morning, officials said. The fire erupted in the two-story home on Valentine Avenue near East 182nd Street in Fordham Heights just after 9 a.m. and spread to two neighboring buildings, according to the FDNY. “Units arrived within 4 minutes and found a heavy volume of fire in the rear of the occupancy,” FDNY Acting Chief of Operations Richard Blatus said at the scene. “A wind condition contributed to the spread of fire to adjoining structures.” The elderly woman, who was discovered on the first floor, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to cops and fire officials. It was not immediately clear whether she lived in the home. Her name has not been released pending family notification. Five civilians and three firefighters also suffered minor injuries, Blatus said. The inferno reached four alarms — calling 75 FDNY and EMS units to the scene before it was placed under control, according to Blatus. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
