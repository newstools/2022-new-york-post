A naked Florida man was arrested after he allegedly murdered a woman and her infant child — then killed another person and injured several more as he tried to flee, police said on Saturday. Dan Spidle, 35, was in three separate hit-and-run car crashes in his botched getaway — and fatally shot the driver of one vehicle that he hit, WSVN reported. Spidle began his crazed crime spree at an apartment complex in Coral Springs, where cops say he killed a woman and left her 1-year-old child mortally wounded. The baby was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, according to local reports. It’s unclear how the two were killed. Spidle fled in a silver 2019 Kia, and was involved in a hit-and-run crash at the corner of West Sample Road and Powerline Road in Pompano Beach, cops told Local 10. Shortly after, he was involved in a four-car collision near Powerline and Sample roads in Coconut Creek. He shot and killed the driver of a white pickup he had hit, and two others were injured in the crash, according to police. Spidle then fled in the truck. Spidle crashed again outside a Walgreens at the corner of Sample Road and Lyons Road in Coconut Creek. He fled the stolen vehicle and attempted to steal a woman’s necklace, authorities said. When Coconut Creek officers arrived on the scene, he was walking around naked. He was arrested and faces charges of murder, burglary and fleeing the scenes of multiple accidents, WSVN reported.
