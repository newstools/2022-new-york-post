Former NHL center Mike Ribeiro is facing sexual assault charges in Texas, court records show. Ribeiro, who retired in 2017, was indicted on two counts of sexual assault on April 13 in Franklin County, according to records cited Wednesday by the Dallas Morning News. The 42-year-old Tennessee resident owns a lakefront property in Mount Vernon, roughly 100 miles northeast of Dallas, where he allegedly assaulted two women last June. Ribeiro allegedly sexually assaulted one woman with his finger and the second with his “sexual organ,” the indictments show. The former Dallas Stars standout was arrested on April 28. He was released later that day after posting $200,000 bond, jail records show. An attorney for Ribeiro did not respond to a request for comment and attempts to reach the veteran ex-center were unsuccessful, the Dallas Morning News reported. The alleged incident is not the first time Ribeiro has been accused of sexual misconduct. In 2015, a former nanny sued him and his wife, claiming he had assaulted her three years earlier, according to the report. The 18-year-old nanny claimed in her lawsuit she was tasked to help Ribeiro’s family move into their new home in Virginia after he was traded by the Stars to the Washington Capitals in 2012. The nanny alleged she was asleep in the basement with two of Ribeiro’s kids when he sexually assaulted her. She also accused him of unwanted touching at other times, the Dallas Morning News reported. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in 2015 after eight hours of mediation, according to court records cited by the newspaper. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, CBS Sports reported at the time. Ribeiro, a native of Montreal, Canada, was drafted as the 45th overall pick by the Canadiens in 1998. He appeared in 1,074 games over the next 17 seasons for five teams and was selected to the All-Star Game in 2008.
