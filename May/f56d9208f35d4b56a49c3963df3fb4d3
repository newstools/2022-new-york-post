A Texas jury convicted a woman of hiring an undercover police officer to kill her boyfriend’s sister over money the other woman owed her for helping to smuggle her into the country. Angelica Navarro-DePaz, 44, was found guilty of solicitation of capital murder in San Antonio court after three hours of deliberation on Wednesday. Prosecutors during the trial presented a recording they said was proof of the murder-for-hire plot on her then-boyfriend’s sister, Anayeli Mendoza Flores, in 2017. In the recording, Navarro-DePaz, an Austin businesswoman, could be heard making a deal with an undercover officer. “I don’t care how she dies. Snatch her, slit her throat, do whatever,” Navarro-DePaz said, according to the San Antonio Express News. Video also showed her agreeing to pay the would-be hitman $1,700 and counting out a $850 deposit, the outlet reported. Prosecutors alleged Flores owed Navarro-DePaz $40,000 for smuggling her into the country. When she took the stand, Navarro-DePaz admitted to making the recording, but only because she was the victim of a criminal organization that had threatened her and her children’s lives. Her defense attorney — who asked his name be kept private due to fear of the same criminal organization his client feared to — said Navarro-DePaz never intended for a murder to actually happen. “There has to be intent from the defendant to have the hit carried out to find her guilty and there’s no proof she ever wanted this crime carried out,” the defense attorney said, according to KSAT. She faces 5 to 99 years or life in prison. The sentencing phase of the trial is ongoing.
