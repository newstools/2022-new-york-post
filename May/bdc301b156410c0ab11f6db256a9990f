For the summer months especially, a hydrating and lightweight skincare routine is the move. But, that all boils down to the formulas you’re using. Luckily, TULA Skincare is here to provide you with a worry-free regimen that’s great all year round, but notably pristine for warmer temps. The brand, which is probiotic-infused to help give you skin that’s brighter and healthier than ever, has a catalog of cult-favorite products, from cleansers and serums to eye creams and moisturizers. Whether you have dry skin or oily skin, TULA Skincare can help mitigate your problem areas and make you feel refreshed. The brand even offers a sweet range of facial sunscreens, moisturizers with SPF and lip balms. Ahead, find every TULA Skincare product we find worthy of an add-to-cart motion. This gentle, milky cleanser not only helps remove makeup and rejuvenate the face, but it also does so without stripping the skin. Plus, it’s formulated with probiotic extracts, colloidal oatmeal (with our dermatologist experts say is great for sensitive skin and to help treat eczema), aloe, ginger and cucumber. As one of our favorite vitamin C serums we tested, TULA Skincare’s Brightening Treatment Drops are next-level. It’s a potent formulation with a 10% triple vitamin C complex, where two types of the vitamin help to reduce the appearance of dark spots, while the other acts as a reactivator to help defend against dull skin. If experiencing acne-prone skin, consider picking up the Clear It Up Acne Clearing + Tone Correcting Gel. This product is great for dry and oily skin types alike — along with combination and mature — to help fade breakout marks. Plus, it’s infused with niacinamide, which covers a whole lot of skin-boosting bases, most notably hydration. If you’re on the market for a new retinol serum, consider the Wrinkle Treatment Drops. Impressively, this formula contains three retinol-alternative ingredients: bakuchiol, alfalfa sprouts and stevia, which help to deeply nourish the skin. It’s also great as a premature anti-aging step in your skincare routine. If your under eyes need some love and attention, the brand’s Instant De-Puff Eye Renewal Serum is your best bet. Encased in travel-friendly packaging, this product is creamy, powered by peptides to help reduce the appearance of under-eye circles (much like your favorite concealer) and is cooling and soothing at the same time. Enter one of the brand’s best-selling products: the Rose Glow & Get It Cooling & Brightening Eye Balm. This $30 staple is infused with hyaluronic acid for unmatched nourishment, along with rosehip oil, a retinol alternative. Plus, it serves as a great makeup primer before your all-day glam. Seeking a decadent eye cream? Look no further than TULA Skincare’s Revive & Rewind Revitalizing Eye Cream. Not only does it help improve the firmness of the skin, but it’s great for day and night use, many thanks to superstar ingredient squalane, which is a lovely soother. Celebrate one of TULA’s new products, the Bright Start Vitamin C Antioxidant Brightening Moisturizer. According to our dermatologist experts, moisturizers with SPF or vitamin C confers many benefits for your skin (like protection, first and foremost) and this product, specifically, contains mandarin orange to really brighten your skin to a noticeable improvement. We’re the first to understand that skincare can cost a pretty penny, so why not pick up a double-agent from TULA Skincare? The brand’s 24/7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream is perfect for your AM and PM routines, especially if glowy, supple skin is what you’re after. That said, it’s like your favorite moisturizer and night cream had a baby. If there’s anything that’s pristine for summer, it’s a whipped body butter or nurturing body lotion. With TULA’s new Take Care + Nourish Advanced Hydrating Body Moisturizer, you’ll be experiencing pure bliss after every shower and refresh. Make sure you’re getting maximum protection with TULA’s Protect + Glow Daily Sunscreen. Ideal to follow your moisturizer, this facial sunscreen is a handy, travel-friendly product to help protect against UVA and UVB rays. Sometimes, you want a beady, textured exfoliant to help reverse the effects of dull skin (without being abrasive, of course). Luckily, TULA’s So Polished Exfoliating Sugar Scrub is a fan favorite, combining sugar, pineapple and papaya to serve as a refreshing summertime skin cocktail. If you’re looking for a product to double as your makeup remover and toner, the Balancing Act Purifying & pH Balancing Biogradable Toner Pads is an answered prayer. Impressively, these toner pads can be tossed into your compost bin (a sustainable win!) and are formulated with witch hazel to help diminish the look of large pores. For summer, there’s nothing better than tinted skincare to make you feel lightweight and easy-breezy. The Filter Primer will soon become your new skincare BFF, notably for its skin-blurring nature and ability to tackle an uneven complexion. Plus, it works on all skin types. Especially for the warmer months, you can’t skip on lip balm for protection and hydration. With a gentle touch of color, the Lip SOS contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and probiotic extracts to provide antioxidant protection and give you the perfect bit of gloss for confident, all-day wear.
