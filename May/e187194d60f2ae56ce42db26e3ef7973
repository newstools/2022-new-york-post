The right suitcase can make a huge difference when you’re traveling. Get one that’s the wrong size and you can be left with no room for anything but your clothes or extra fees for a last-minute checked bag. The Rollux 2-in-1 Expandable Suitcase can transform according to your need, and for a limited time it’s on sale for $199.97 (Reg. $349). A unique expandable suitcase, the Rollux gives you options for how much you want to pack. The patented design can switch from a compact personal bag to a full-sized rolling suitcase over twice its original volume. Its simple collapsing and expanding design works for overnight trips or weeks-long stints abroad and everything in between. The Rollux is unique in how many travel needs it anticipates in one cohesive design. If you like leaving home with the bare essentials and coming back with a full bag of souvenirs and keepsakes, you can do it all with the same bag. For one Amazon reviewer, that versatility made a huge difference: “It truly transforms from carry on to a full size suitcase in a matter of seconds, which is crazy and pretty useful. I recently used it one way from NY to Florida as a carry- on, and returned with the Rollux as a full size to bring home some gifts I bought in the Keys.” If you’re worried about your phone battery and don’t want to fight for an outlet before getting on the plane, just use the removable power bank that lets you plug your phone right into your bag. It even has quick-access pockets for your keys, wallet, or other fast-grab accessories that you don’t want to rifle through your luggage for. And when you’re not traveling, storage is simple. Collapse your Rollux and store it in a fraction of the space a comparable bag might take up. Pack a bag that will literally rise to the occasion.
