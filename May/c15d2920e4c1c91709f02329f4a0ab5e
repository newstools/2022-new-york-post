Dramatic new videos show a column of Russian tanks being picked out and blown up — while another explodes in a massive ball of flames, with debris blown sky-high in front of watching motorists. Ukraine’s 54th Mechanized Brigade, based in the Donbas region, shared footage Tuesday of a platoon getting destroyed — setting the clip to upbeat, patriotic music. The clip shows the line of tanks driven by invading troops — whom the unit termed “tourists” — driven along an unidentified road as smoke from repeated airstrikes fills the sky. Several of the military vehicles then suffer direct hits, bursting into balls of flame — including one where debris exploded high into the sky. Similar devastation was caught in a graphic dashcam clip caught by a Chinese state TV reporter in Mariupol, according to his station, Phoenix TV. The footage shows the reporter and his local fixer driving through the city on the way to interview those hunkered down at the Azovstal steel plant, passing numerous buses, cars and even pedestrians. Their dashcam then caught a massive explosion — with what looked like a tank turret thrown more than 100 feet into the sky. Phoenix TV said the blast happened last Friday, hitting at least one of two Russian tanks ahead of the reporter — who said he was only saved after a soldier had earlier told him to slow down. As of Thursday, Ukraine’s military claimed it had destroyed nearly 1,200 tanks and another 2,873 armored vehicles, as well as more than 2,000 assorted military vehicles and nearly 200 aircraft. The armed forces also claimed to have killed at least 26,650 invading troops. Western intelligence services have repeatedly highlighted the surprise failings of the Kremlin’s ambitions, with the US this week suggesting they had left it in a likely drawn-out “stalemate” with Ukraine.
