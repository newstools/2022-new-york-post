Members of the British royal family have secretly opened their doors to Ukrainian refugees, offering housing for “a number” of people displaced by  Russia’s invasion. It’s not known how many of the six million refugees that have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict in February have been given shelter in royal households or which members of the family are involved, according to a report in Britain’s the Sun newspaper. A Buckingham Palace spokesman told the newspaper Saturday: “The Royal Household is looking at a number of ways to offer practical help and support.” Sources told the Daily Express that a few members of the royal family are involved in helping the refugees but they have “a firm wish” for no publicity.
