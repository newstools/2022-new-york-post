It turns out the way you’re applying makeup can make you look older than necessary. Luckily, there are a handful of smart tips to follow to create a more youthful appearance. According to Celia Mendes on Facebook, “40 is the new 20!” She uploaded a video showcasing some of the smartest beauty tips older women can follow to achieve a more youthful appearance. She starts her video out by asking: “Is your makeup placement aging you?” She continues: “If you’re over 40, I’m going to show you how makeup placement can change your face shape.” Celia’s first tip is to avoid applying darker colored contour way too low on your face. She says you should start at the top of your ear and draw a line parallel to your eye across the top of your cheekbone. Creating a triangle shape with concealer underneath your eye is another no-go, according to Celia. You might think making a triangle shape is the best thing to do to hide dark circles under your eyes, but that would be totally false. Concealer made in a triangle shape actually ends up sitting deep in the fine lines of your face, exposing wrinkles that shouldn’t be seen. Instead, Celia advises dabbing your concealer in the inner and outer corners of your eyes. She explains: “This will actually lift – and not sit in your fine lines or wrinkles.” Lastly, she talks about how women were taught to apply blush to the apples of our cheeks when we were younger. Celia says you should be adding blush to the higher parts of your cheeks for a more lifted look. The old-school theory of blush on the apples of cheeks simply doesn’t work for women in their 40s. There’s nothing wrong with getting older, and many people believe the aging process is actually quite beautiful. Even so, it’s completely fine to practice beauty techniques that might help create a more youthful appearance. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
