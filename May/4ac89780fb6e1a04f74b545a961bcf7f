Penguins coach Mike Sullivan had no update on Sidney Crosby’s status Thursday morning after Crosby left Wednesday’s Game 5 loss to the Rangers in the second period with an upper-body injury following a hit by Jacob Trouba and didn’t return. Sullivan told reporters Thursday that Crosby, 34, would be traveling back with the team to Pittsburgh, where he’d get further evaluated. Sullivan declined to get into more specifics about the injury. Trouba made contact with Crosby’s head in a collision after reaching his stick out for the puck. Asked if Trouba’s hit warrants NHL discipline, Sullivan told reporters it’s “not my responsibility” to make that determination. However, The Post’s Larry Brooks reported Thursday that the Rangers have been told the NHL will not be punishing Trouba for the hit. Sullivan made clear his thoughts on the contact Wednesday night: “Did you see the hit? You probably have the same opinion I do.” The Rangers scored three second-period goals in a span of 2:42 after Crosby left to take a 3-2 lead before the Penguins quickly tied it. The Rangers went on to win 5-3, cutting the series deficit to 3-2 with Game 6 set for Friday in Pittsburgh. “We can win games regardless of who is in our lineup,” Sullivan said Thursday. “We have a lot of depth at all of the positions. We believe we have what it takes to win.”
