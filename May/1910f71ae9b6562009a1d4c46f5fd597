Thieves on scooters are zooming up to unsuspecting pedestrians and, in a matter of seconds, swiping thousands of dollars worth of gold chains before taking off, according to the NYPD. Police are investigating five such robberies between March 18 and April 17 in the Bronx and Manhattan. The first robbery happened at 12:38 p.m. March 18, when two men on a black scooter approached a 47-year-old man on East Fordham Road in Fordham Heights and ripped an $8,000 gold chain from his neck, police said. About 20 minutes later that same day, a 42-year-old man was standing in front of 516 West 181st St. in Washington Heights when a man on a black scooter rode up to him, showed a gun and grabbed gold chains worth $10,000 from his neck, police said.
