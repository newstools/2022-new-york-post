Paige Spiranac is used to being flooded with DMs on a regular basis, and this week, she pulled back the curtain on some of the disturbing words sent her way. Taking to her Instagram Stories, the “Playing A Round” podcast host, 29, shared a screenshot of some of the DMs received, with some followers vocalizing their desires while others inquired about her mom, who was featured in a Mother’s Day post from last weekend. “Is your mom single by chance? I’m closer to her age then yours. Just throwing that out there. Have her call me,” the message read. In a separate video, Spiranac asked her 3.3 million Instagram followers if they wanted to keep seeing the messages, even setting up a poll. “Let me know if you want me to keep this going, should I do this more often or no?” she said. The results from Spiranac’s poll have yet to be revealed. Although this week’s DMs definitely did not go unnoticed by Spiranac, she revealed in 2020 which comments grab her attention “a lot.” “I hate when someone will just send, ‘Hey,’ or ‘How are you,’ ‘What’s up.’ I want to laugh, I want to be entertained, I want to have a connection from the very start, to start a conversation,” she said at the time. “It’s so hard when someone says, ‘Hey.’ What do you say back to that, you know? You can’t do anything.” Spiranac also said she’s found it clever when gents have added furniture emojis in their messages as a way to say, “Hey sorry, just moving into your DMs.”
