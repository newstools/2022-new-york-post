An elderly woman celebrating her grandchild’s high school graduation was shot dead and two men were wounded at a New Orleans college on Tuesday, according to authorities and reports. The gunfire erupted during an argument in the Xavier University of Louisiana parking lot, near the college’s convocation center where a graduation ceremony for Morris Jeff High School had taken place, WVUE reported, citing police. The age and name of the slain woman — who was believed to be an innocent bystander — were not immediately available. The two male victims were shot in the leg and shoulder and their injuries were not life-threatening, New Orleans Police Department Deputy Superintendent Christopher Goodly told the local Fox affiliate. Three people were taken into custody for questioning, but no charges had been announced as of early Tuesday afternoon. The department confirmed on Twitter at around 1:15 p.m. that three people had been shot and taken to local hospitals. Labeling the incident a “senseless act of violence,” Goodly said it began with a fight between two women that escalated when shots were fired. Witnesses told the outlet that the brawl started following the graduation ceremony, and that they heard between five and 12 gunshots. After the gunfire, a handgun remained in the parking lot and an SUV’s window was broken as cops investigated the crime scene, the Times-Picayune reported. An anonymous witness to the shooting told the newspaper they heard about 20 shots. Another witness, who attended his niece’s graduation, told the outlet he heard the shots about 10 minutes after the ceremony concluded. The elderly woman who was fatally shot was the grandmother of a graduating student, a witness said on WDSU-TV, according to the Times-Picayune. “This is supposed to be a joyous occasion and it is very sad for us to have to go through something like this. This is horrible,” another witness reportedly told WDSU-TV. “It’s too much.”
