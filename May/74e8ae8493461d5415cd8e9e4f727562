Despite calling The Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop a “Trump campaign product” and blasting Republican concerns about the teaching of “critical race theory” in public schools as “weaponizing people’s emotion,” the now-former head of the Biden administration’s short-lived disinformation board is denying she has a pro-Democrat bias. Nina Jankowicz made the far-fetched claim to MSNBC “All In” host Chris Hayes hours after she announced her resignation following the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to “pause” the Disinformation Governance Board. “To say that I am just a partisan actor was wildly out of context,” claimed Jankowicz, who went on to say she had received death threats almost every day during her three weeks on the job. “Over the last three weeks I have had maybe one or two days [where] I didn’t report a violent threat, something like, ‘We’re coming for you and your family, ‘You and your family should be sent to Russia to be killed,'” she said. The board was criticized almost from the moment of its creation last month by conservatives, libertarians and even some liberals, who compared it to the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell’s novel “1984.” The criticism grew after it was revealed that Jankowicz herself had pushed the since-debunked claim in 2016 that then-presidential candidate Donald Trump had a tie to a Russian bank. The so-called “disinformation expert” also repeatedly tried to spread doubt about The Post’s verified scoop on Hunter Biden’s notorious laptop, telling the Associated Press in October 2020 that it should be viewed as “a Trump campaign product.”
