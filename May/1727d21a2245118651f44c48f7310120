City violence only grows more painful. The latest horror: an 11-year-old girl caught in the crossfire at a Bronx shooting. How many more innocents must die before Gov. Kathy Hochul and legislative leaders deign to fix — i.e., really fix — the state’s pro-criminal bail and Raise the Age laws? Kyhara Tay, 11, was just standing outside a nail salon Monday when a gunman opened fire, aiming for someone else but fatally striking her in the stomach. And the long line of young victims is sure to grow. “This is very difficult for us to accept,” Bronx detectives Deputy Chief Timothy McCormack said, noting that the shooting comes just months after an 11-month-old was hit. Indeed, only hours before Tay’s killing, bullets struck two teen boys in Brooklyn. Over Sunday night, eight people were fired on citywide. Last week, police say Terrel Norman fired at a crowd in Brooklyn. Norman has more than two dozen busts under his belt, served time for armed robbery and was on parole at the time and awaiting trial on another gun charge. But liberty for his like is what state lawmakers clearly want. After all, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins refuse to fix the “reforms” that are clearly fueling the nightmare. Sure, they caved to Hochul’s pressure and made minor tweaks to the laws this year. But they still won’t let judges consider the “dangerousness” of a defendant — i.e., whether he’s a threat to public safety — in setting bail or jailing him, leaving New York the only state in the nation with such a restriction. They’re also against any rollback of the Raise the Age law, which sends serious crime cases involving 16- and 17-year-olds to Family Court, where perps face virtually no consequences. Mayor Eric Adams raised these issues in Albany again Tuesday, along with the rest of his end-of-session agenda. But Heastie, Stewart-Cousins and all the Democrats who support them won’t lift a finger to prevent more tragedies like Kyhara Tay’s.
