You’ll want to get moving if you want to get your hands (and feet) on this new footwear launch. From Free People’s athletic division, FP Movement, comes a super swift collaboration with HOKA footwear. The two companies came up with three amazing options, including two sneakers and one pair of slides, perfect for the poolside. “HOKA couldn’t be more excited to partner with FP Movement, a true leader in the fashion forward fitness and wellness space. Our design teams worked together seamlessly to create a beautiful collection that celebrates how color can infuse excitement and joy into every day movement,” said Gretchen Weimer, Vice President of Product at HOKA in a press release. You do need to run to your computers fast, though, as one pair of the kicks have already sold out in just a few hours after the May 16 launch. The HOKA x FP Movement Clifton 8 Sneakers in green and blue are gone for now, but be sure to bookmark this link in case they come back to shelves in the near future. In the meantime, shop these two styles below, one for the track and one for the beach, now on the FP Movement site. Also, make note that the site also sells other HOKA styles, should you need to stock up on their other essential shoes for spring and summer. These sneakers scream spring and summer, coming in a delightful yellow shade with pink and white flowers and detailing. They have HOKA’s ultralight construction that makes running a breeze, plus breathable mesh to keep your feet cool as your workout heats up. Slide into summer with these HOKA x FP Movement slides. They come in both the pictured pastel pattern above or in a periwinkle purple shade. They are super comfy, too, with HOKA’s signature ONE ONE oversized midsole and the strategic groove placements on the sole for a cushioned effect. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
