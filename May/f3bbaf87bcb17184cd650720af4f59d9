Coco Gauff is at the brink of greatness at the French Open. Gauff has yet to drop a set on her way to the semifinals at Roland Garros after knocking off fellow American Sloane Stephens 7-5, 6-2 on Tuesday. “I am just enjoying life,” the 18-year-old Gauff told Tennis Channel after the victory. “Before I would be so hyper-focused, wouldn’t even walk around the city because it was just (all about) tennis, tennis, tennis.” Gauff will next face another first-time semifinalist in Martina Trevisan, who earlier beat Leylah Fernandez. Gauff will likely be favored over the unseeded Italian and has a chance to pay off the promise that many saw in the Georgia native when she reached the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2019. Gauff built early leads in both sets and Stephens made errors at key points on Court Philippe Chatrier. The 18th-seeded Gauff led 3-1 in the second set when Stephens missed an opportunity to get back on serve, sending a drive volley long on her third break-point chance before Gauff won the next two points. “Just staying composed,” Gauff said about the closing games. “Got a little nervous. At the changeover I just told myself to focus on the moment.” Stephens had won three straight games to even the first set at 5-5 but Gauff won the next seven points and broke for the set. Stephens missed a backhand volley to hand Gauff her first set-point opportunity. The 29-year-old Stephens, the former No. 3, won at Flushing Meadows in 2017 and was the runner-up at Roland Garros the next year. Tennis Channel analyst Lindsay Davenport has also noticed a difference in Gauff. “She’s been waiting for her time,” Davenport said. “She’s almost wanted it too bad (in the past).” Gauff’s time could be now. — With AP
