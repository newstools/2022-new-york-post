The Browns couldn’t find a deal. And thus, the Baker Mayfield saga continues. The Panthers were in talks to acquire the disgruntled quarterback from Cleveland on Friday night during Day 2 of the 2022 NFL Draft, but with a deal in the works, talks ended up falling through. Per Yahoo’s Charles Robinson, the sticking point came over the remaining $18.8 million on Mayfield’s contract, which Carolina did not want to shoulder. Apparently, neither did the Browns. Now what? “It’s a fluid situation,” Browns GM Andrew Berry said while appearing on 92.3 The Fan. “We will deal with it day by day. We are pleased with the weekend and pleased with the guys that we added.” The Browns traded for controversial quarterback Deshaun Watson earlier in the offseason, giving him a $230 million guaranteed contract despite nearly two dozen allegations of sexual misconduct against him. It left Mayfield, who just four years ago was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, in limbo with the team that made him the face of the franchise. Mayfield has made it known he wants out. Recently, he went on the “Ya Neva Know” podcast and said he feels “disrespected” by the team. However, amid a big offseason of quarterback movement, the Browns have yet to find a taker, likely due to his struggles in 2021. A season after winning Cleveland’s first playoff game in nearly three decades, Mayfield managed just 3,010 yards, 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions last year, while playing through a variety of injuries. His attitude and relationship with teammates has also come into question. The Panthers were long considered to be the most likely destination for Mayfield, but they ended up drafting Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral in the third round instead. It’s possible the Browns could hang onto Mayfield as a backup – or a starter in case Watson gets suspended by the NFL. It’s hard to imagine that would be a situation the 27-year-old would enjoy.
