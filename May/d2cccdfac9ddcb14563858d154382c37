Well, someone broke the rules. A naughty audience member snuck pictures and video — warning: you see it all — of a naked Jesse Williams during the Broadway show “Take Me Out.” The full-frontal footage, which surfaced on social media Monday, was captured during a shower scene of the play, which tells the story of a gay professional baseball player dealing with coming out to his teammates and in the press. It opened on Broadway last month. The footage dropped on the same day Williams received a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play. All spectators are required to place their phones and smart devices in a sealed Yondr case before the show “out of respect and support for our actors and in order to create a phone-free space,” according to 2nd Stage Theater’s website. The case can only be reopened by placing it on an unlocking tab in the lobby. The NSFW site GayBlog.ca appeared to be the first to share the videos, and fans quickly reacted on Twitter, with some thanking the sneaky photographer for the leak and others suggesting a second career for Williams on the adult site OnlyFans. Williams recently revealed that he was “terrified” of putting his body on display for the show, “but then I noted that that was what I asked God for,” he said. “I asked to be terrified. I asked to do something that was scary and challenging and made me earn it and made me feel alive and not comfortable.” The Post has reached out to reps for Williams and the Broadway show for comments about the surreptitious shots. Williams and “Take Me Out” co-star Jesse Tyler Ferguson were scheduled to appear on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Monday at 10 p.m. on Bravo.
