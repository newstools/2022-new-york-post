Mike Tyson had another heated fan encounter this past weekend in Las Vegas — just days after he was filmed punching an overly excited fan aboard a JetBlue flight. Tyson — who was in Vegas attending events ahead of the Shakur Stevenson’s unanimous decision win over Oscar Valdez at MGM Grand Garden Arena — was taking photos with fans when a woman stuck her finger close to his face from behind. Tyson wasn’t having it, and instantly turned around to confront the woman when her pink fingernail came close to nose. His security appeared to rush over to the woman to de-escalate the situation, and Tyson’s entourage escorted him away from the crowd. Tyson has been busy recording his “Hotboxin” podcast and promoting his Tyson 2.0 bud line, which he launched late last year. The former heavyweight champion was traveling from San Francisco to Miami for a speaking engagement at the Benzinga Cannabis Conference, when the April 21 airplane altercation took place. Tyson’s reps claimed the fan on the plane, Melvin Townsend III, threw a water bottle at Tyson to provoke him. Townsend’s attorney denied the latter claim. Townsend reportedly declined to press charges at the time, and both he and Tyson were free to leave after the incident. It’s unclear if an investigation is ongoing.
