Tyrann Mathieu appears to be closing out his 20s in style. The newly signed Saints safety appears to be getting his 30th birthday festivities underway with fiancée Sydni Paige, according to an Instagram Story she shared Monday. “Birthday week stars now #30,” Sydni captioned the post, which featured Mathieu aboard a private jet. Although Mathieu doesn’t technically turn the big 3-0 until Friday, May 13, he’ll be entering his next decade as a member of the Saints following the past three years with the Chiefs. The Saints initially expressed interest in Mathieu early last month, with the organization making a renewed push to sign the New Orleans native after the NFL Draft. Both parties agreed on a three-year, $33 million deal with $18 million guaranteed. Prior to being chosen by the Cardinals in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Mathieu played college football at LSU. Mathieu, a three-time Pro Bowler, won his first and only Super Bowl in February 2020 with the Chiefs, where he initially landed in 2019 on a three-year contract. During Mathieu’s time in Kansas City, Sydni was a game-day staple, often watching from a suite at Arrowhead Stadium with fellow Chiefs WAGs, including Brittany Matthews, the wife of quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Paige joined Matthews for her epic bachelorette party in February, weeks before she and Mahomes tied the knot in Hawaii. Mathieu and Paige have been engaged since 2019.
