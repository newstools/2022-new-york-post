The Twins haven’t treated us well this season. They’ve played well, but obviously the pressure of being the “Stitch pick” is weighing heavily on their collective psyche. The Astros will play at Minnesota on Thursday afternoon. Houston’s Luis Garcia (2-1, 3.45) has been an ace at night, a joker in day games. He has allowed 11 runs on the year, but seven in just 12 afternoon innings. The Twins’ Josh Winder (2-0, 1.61) has been stingy, allowing four runs over 22 ²/₃ and no runs in his last 12. Afternoon delight. Play 10 units on the Twinkies.  Like night and day. These Mets do not resemble the 2021 edition. Not even close. Latest example? Tuesday night when that rat ran on the field. Francisco Lindor and Jeff McNeil didn’t even flinch … So what happened?! The Mets jumped out to a 3-0 lead, so I watched the Rangers stave off elimination by beating the Penguins. Turned the Mets back on to find the lowly Nats up 8-3. Boxscore shows Tylor Megill gave up (WHAT?) eight runs in 1 ¹/₃ innings?  WTF?! Loss. Still up +163 throneberrys.
