Yankees manager Aaron Boone didn’t exit the field quietly after he was tossed in Wednesday’s 2-1 loss to the Blue Jays. Boone went off on home plate umpire Marty Foster in the bottom of the eighth over strike calls on Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge. In a video posted by Jomboy, Boone can be seen yelling, “Make the f–king adjustment,” repeatedly at the ump, which led to him getting ejected. Boone then threw his gum and stomped onto the field, getting in the umpire’s face to continue the argument. “F–king make the f–king adjustment. You just missed the same f–king call,” Boone continued. Foster responded, “What was wrong with that pitch?” “That ball is f–king down. He’s 6 f–king 7,” Boone screamed, referring to Judge and the pitches below his knees that were called strikes. “He’s 6-7, that’s a strike if he’s 6-8,” Foster replied to Boone. “He’s f–king pitching around him and you’re calling f–king strikes in the dirt,” Boone continued yelling. Warning: Graphic language When the ump told Boone to “get out of my face,” Boone yelled again to “make the f—ing adjustment.” The umpire hit back, accusing Boone of spitting on him, and said, “You make the f–king adjustment.” Boone eventually exited the field. After the game, he addressed the argument. “We’re playing for a lot and I felt like there were a couple there in situations that didn’t go our way,” he said. When asked about the umpire’s claim that he spit on him, Boone said, “I don’t know. I was pretty mad out there so hopefully not any suspension or anything. I kept it in control somewhat.” The Yankees begin a three-game series against the Rangers on Friday.
