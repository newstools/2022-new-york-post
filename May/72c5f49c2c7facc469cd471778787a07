The NFL could do away with the Pro Bowl. According to multiple reports, team officials and owners discussed eliminating the annual all-star game at a meeting in Atlanta on Monday. While no decision has been made official,  the Washington Post reported that a seven-on-seven competition is being considered to take the place of the Pro Bowl, that would not include a full game with tackling. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported the NFL could use Pro Bowl Sunday to showcase players who are voted to the Pro Bowl, without holding an actual game. A flag football game could be a possible alternative solution, among others, per Rapoport. The report came after the 2022 Pro Bowl produced its lowest viewership (6.7 million) for the game in 16 years. Many players took to Twitter in February to poke fun at the intensity in this year’s Pro Bowl — including Cardinals star JJ Watt, who tweeted, “I’ve seen walk-thrus more intense than this.” When the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the 2021 Pro Bowl being canceled, the NFL held a number of events to honor players, instead of an actual game.
