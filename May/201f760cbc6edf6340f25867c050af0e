ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The Yankees added some bullpen depth in the minors, signing right-hander Shane Greene to a minor league deal on Thursday and sending him to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The 33-year-old was most recently with the Dodgers and made one appearance with Los Angeles this season before being designated for assignment on May 17. Originally a 2009 draft pick of the Yankees, Greene was part of the three-team trade with Detroit and Arizona that brought Didi Gregorius to The Bronx. Greene went on to become an All-Star with the Tigers in 2019.
