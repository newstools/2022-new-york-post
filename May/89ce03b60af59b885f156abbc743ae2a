Any big buckets in Sunday’s huge Heat-Celtics Game 7 will be missing Mike Breen’s signature “bang” call. Breen has tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the winner-take-all Eastern Conference Finals game for ESPN. Mark Jones will handle play-by-play duties in Breen’s place. Breen “feels fine,” according to The Post’s Andrew Marchand, and the network hopes he’ll be able to call Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday. While Jones is also the play-by-player for the Sacramento Kings, he has lived in South Florida and isn’t shy about his Heat fandom. “I’m admittedly a Miami Heat homer,” Jones told the South Florida Sun Sentinel in 2020. “But on the air, I’m professional and I’m unbiased and impartial. But I enjoy telling the stories of players who are part of the Heat organization and the lineage of the Heat organization.” The Heat-Celtics winner will face the Warriors in the NBA Finals.
