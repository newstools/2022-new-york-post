Congratulations, football fan! Your favorite team has won the draft! The combination of 1) an absolute, nationwide obsession with the NFL and 2) an absolute dearth of quality information about a sport that is nearly impossible to properly dissect in real time has led to a booming draft-coverage economy. Seemingly every outlet publishes plenty of mock drafts leading up to Draft Day(s) then offers instant analyses on how each team performed. The goal is to contextualize every pick because fans care and fans click. Draft grades are fun! Everyone reads them, even if years later, when the prospects have or have not developed, the grades may look terribly informed. If you look far enough, you can find hope for every single team in the NFL. In a year or two (or a month or two), every team will notice mistakes it has made and bemoan at least a few picks. At the moment, though, there is optimism around every single name you had not heard of a week ago.
