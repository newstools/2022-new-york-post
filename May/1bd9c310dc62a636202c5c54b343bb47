The longtime Manhattan home of the late model Jacqueline Eckert — who worked under the stage name Adrian Storms — is up for sale for $5 million. Eckert, who passed away in 2018 at age 93, lived in the three-bedroom, three-bathroom Upper West Side spread for more than four decades after she purchased the residence with her late husband, Thor Eckert, in 1968. Her estate is now putting the home up for sale for the first time since that deal. She was known as one of the top Manhattan socialites and fashion models during the 1940s — having appeared on the cover of Vogue, and adorned billboards and ads for brands like Railway Express and Lucky Strike. Stepping into the home, located at 101 Central Park West, it appears to be stuck in time, with a very pragmatic yet vintage vibe. “Capture the feeling of living like New York City royalty,” the listing states. Upon entry is a gallery, which connects to almost every room. The residence, on the eighth floor, features a living room with a fireplace, a library with another fireplace and built-in bookshelves, a formal dining room and a time-capsule kitchen with its own service entrance. Directly across from Central Park, the pre-war building was also once home to Harrison Ford, Rick Moranis and Noah Emmerich. Lisa Tarnopol Deslauriers and Linda Reiner of Coldwell Banker Warburg hold the listing.
