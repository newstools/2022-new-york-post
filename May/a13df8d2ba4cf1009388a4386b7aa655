BALTIMORE — The Yankees bullpen has been among the highlights of their historically good start to the season. Thursday, though, was not a good day. Chad Green was pulled with right forearm discomfort while facing Austin Hays with two outs in the bottom of the sixth against the Orioles at Camden Yards. He’ll be reevaluated in New York on Friday. After getting off to a rough start to the season, the right-hander had allowed just two hits, a pair of walks and a run in his previous six outings, while striking out 10. On Thursday, Green had already allowed a go-ahead single by pinch-hitter Rougned Odor and a game-tying sacrifice fly to Cedric Mullins. Green came in with the bases loaded and no one out thanks to a rough outing by Miguel Castro, who loaded the bases to start the frame. Jonathan Loaisiga finally finished the inning.
