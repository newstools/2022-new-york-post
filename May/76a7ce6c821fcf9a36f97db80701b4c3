The Mets suddenly have a vacancy to fill in their rotation. Four days after his worst career start, the team has placed Tylor Megill on the injured list with right biceps inflammation. The right-hander will undergo an MRI exam Sunday to determine the extent of his injury. Megill lasted only 1 1/3 innings and allowed eight earned runs in his start against the Nationals on Wednesday. Overall he is 4-2 with a 4.41 ERA in seven starts as Jacob deGrom’s replacement in the rotation. DeGrom has been on the IL since the season started, after he was diagnosed with a stress reaction in his right scapula. Colin Holderman was selected from Triple-A Syracuse to fill Megill’s roster spot. The Mets moved Trevor May to the 60-day injured list to place Holderman on the 40-man roster. David Peterson could be an option in the longer term to replace MegIll in the rotation. But the left-hander just pitched Friday for Syracuse. The Mets will need a starter in Megill’s place for Monday night against the Cardinals
