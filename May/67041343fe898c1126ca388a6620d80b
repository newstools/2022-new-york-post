“Modern Family” star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and his husband, Tony Award-winning producer Justin Mikita, have just sold their Gramercy Park home. The 200 E. 16th St. co-op traded hands for $1.44 million, according to public records. The sale comes as Ferguson told Bravo’s Andy Cohen earlier this week that it might be time — after the show’s popular run — for a “Modern Family” spin-off. (The series, which won 22 Emmys, ended with Ferguson’s character, Mitch, and Eric Stonestreet’s Cam, moving to Missouri.) Ferguson and Mikita relisted this apartment in January for $1.44 million — as they previously moved with their child into a bigger two-bedroom home in Chelsea. That $3 million home, at d’Orsay, is reportedly 1,402 square feet and comes with a private elevator landing, an open chef’s kitchen and a terrace. It first listed for $1.49 million in 2018. Ferguson bought it for $1.23 million in 2015. At 900 square feet, this just-sold unit features 11-foot ceilings, sets of French doors and a master bedroom with double marble vanities in the ensuite bathroom. The home’s open chef’s kitchen is where the Emmy-nominated Ferguson created recipes for “Food Between Friends: A Cookbook,” which he co-authored. The pre-war building comes with a gym, a laundry room and bike storage. The listing broker was actor Sarah Saltzberg of Bohemia Realty Group.
