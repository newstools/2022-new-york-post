Tom Brady’s life after football just got a little clearer. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced on Tuesday that Brady agreed to a long-term deal with the network and will be Fox Sports’ lead NFL analyst when he retires. The Post’s Andrew Marchand reports Brady’s deal is for $375 million over 10 years. Brady will work alongside Kevin Burkhardt whenever his NFL career ends. “Over the course of this long-term agreement, Tom will not only call our biggest NFL games with Kevin Burkhardt, but will also serve as an ambassador for us, particularly with respect to client and promotional initiatives,” Fox Sports said in a statement. The seven-time Super Bowl champ briefly called it a career in February before announcing 40 days later that he’d be returning to the Buccaneers for his 23rd NFL season. Brady, 44, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that while he’s “excited” about his post-NFL venture, there’s “a lot of unfinished business on the field” with the Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were bounced from the playoffs in January following a NFC Divisional round loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Rams. Two months later, head coach Bruce Arians announced he’d be shifting to a front-office job, with former defensive coordinator Todd Bowles being named his successor. The Brady news comes after Fox Joe Buck and Troy Aikman departed the network for ESPN. Buck and Aikman, who have called more than 300 games together for Fox, will slide into the “Monday Night Football” booth on Sept. 12.
