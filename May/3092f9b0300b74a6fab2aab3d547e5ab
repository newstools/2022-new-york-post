There’s shameless and then there’s Media Matters for America. Angelo Carusone, president of the group that claims to be a “press watchdog” but is really a partisan political outfit, told a C-SPAN caller that Twitter was right to block The New York Post. The New York Times and Washington Post might be writing exactly what we wrote in October 2020, but our original reports, Carusone claims, were “journalistically unsound.” They “did not meet any minimum editorial standards” and “did not provide any evidence: they did not verify anything that they were reporting.” This is horse manure. The Post interviewed the computer repairman who worked on the laptop. We checked various e-mails with the times and dates of Hunter’s travels that we knew about. We went through literally hundreds of pictures of him on the hard drive, which would have taken a Herculean effort to photoshop. Recipients of e-mails, including businessman Tony Bobulinski, confirmed their authenticity after our first report. And here’s the cherry on top: Hunter and Joe Biden never denied the laptop was real. Oh, the Bidens claimed it was a political hit job, but how does that make it “unsound”? Funny how Media Matters has no problem with Politico running a draft opinion from the Supreme Court, obviously given to it anonymously for political reasons. Would it have been right for Twitter to ban the media outlet? Founded by Democratic operatives and working with them hand-in-glove, Media Matters helps suppress stories that hurt liberals. Carusone’s efforts to discredit the Hunter Biden story and his continued slander of our reporting show the group has no credibility. The Media Matters crew aren’t “sound journalists.” They aren’t journalists at all. And no one should ever quote them as an independent or expert source ever again.
