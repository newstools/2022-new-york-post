A Chinese food delivery man making a food drop on a scooter in Queens was shot and killed Saturday night, possibly by a stray bullet, according to police. Zhiwen Yan, 45, was making a delivery near 108th Street and 67th Drive in Forest Hills around 9:30 p.m. when he was struck once in the chest, police said on Sunday. Yan, of Queens, was found unconscious at the scene after police responded to a 911 call, and rushed to Elmhurst Hospital, according to police. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Police said there have been no arrests and the investigation is continuing for a motive — although cops believe Yan was hit by a stray bullet. But according to a GoFundMe page posted on Sunday for Yan’s three children, the shooting was “a random act of road rage” while he was on a delivery run for Chinese restaurant Great Wall. Witnesses told cops a Lexus was seen fleeing the scene, sources told The Post. Yan migrated from China more than 20 years ago and delivers for the eatery seven days a week, the GoFundMe page said, and leaves behind three children, ages 2, 12 and 14. The page had raised more than $8,500 by midday Sunday and has a goal of $100,000. Cops are now scouring the neighborhood for surveillance footage of the shooting.
