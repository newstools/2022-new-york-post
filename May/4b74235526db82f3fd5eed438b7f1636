Bullets buzzed past Bronx Council Member Pierina Sanchez’s office for the second week in a row, sending the pol and her team ducking for cover on Tuesday. “Shots fired outside our office again this afternoon. Again in broad daylight,” Sanchez said on Twitter hours after the gunfire outside her  Morris Avenue office. “Down to the ground went our team, to take cover. It hit even harder this week than last. Went out went on the block and our community’s trauma was thick in the air,” the lawmaker wrote. Tuesday’s scare came eight days after a 24-year-old man was shot in the leg right outside her office door. The NYPD said officers responded to the latest report of shots fired at about 4:30 p.m., but didn’t immediately find any victims. The council member, who was born and raised in the Bronx, said gun violence has taken its toll on her community. “Our collective hurt, palpable,” Sanchez tweeted. “Neighbors who ran for the lives, again. Moms hugging their children tightly. Community leaders, our OGs & partners in this work, who give so much to make things better, yelling out WHY.” She said she checked on neighbors and community members following last week’s shooting as well. The gunman in last week’s shooting fled southbound on Morris Avenue and remains at large, police said. On Tuesday, Sanchez said she wasn’t shocked by the gun violence, but angry. “Am I in shock? No. I grew up here,” she said in the aftermath. “This is what we face in the ‘hood year after year. I’m thankful it wasn’t worse. Thankful our team is okay. But I’m angry it ever comes to violence.” The council member said the city must take guns off the streets and invest in affordable housing, after school programs and job development to address the root cause of gun violence. “We shouldn’t have to think twice about walking down our own block. Whether our kids can play in the garden,” Sanchez said. “We deserve more.”
