A lash technician has shown off a client’s glamorous results but people have been quick to comment with their less-than-complimentary views. TikTok user @luxuryxlash uploaded a video of the finished result with the caption: “Cant beat lash day.” The clip showed the client wearing very full lashes that were sure to stand out. While some people liked the look, others were quick to slam it in the comments. One likened the look to “CATERPILLARS” and another said they looked “clumpy.” Another person wrote: “she’s about to take flight.” A third wrote: “wait is this a joke.” And one commented: “I could fly away with that.” The video has racked up 23,000 likes and in another video, the technician specified that she likes to go “over the top.” Previously, a beautician warned women to NEVER use eyelash curlers. In a viral TikTok video, Ipek Ozcan — who runs IPS Salon in London – urged people to NEVER use curlers on their natural lashes. The beautician wrote: “So today while I was cleansing my client’s lashes, I noticed so many natural lashes that looked like they’d been cut.” Filming the short, stunted lashes, Ipek continued: “They looked blunt. “Do you know why they look this way? It’s because she uses eyelash curlers!” Picking apart the fake lashes from the broken real ones, the beautician claimed: “They’re a quick fix for getting lifted lashes but they are so damaging and literally cut your natural lashes!” The expert then warned her 502,000 followers to “step away from the eyelash curlers” and only use them when you’ve had a lift. Instead, she recommended using a heated curler which doesn’t clamp down on lashes or having a lift to achieve a voluminous look.
