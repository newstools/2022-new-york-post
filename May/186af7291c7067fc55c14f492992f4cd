Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals tips off tonight and Brandon Anderson of The Action Network is here to give you a best bet (video above). For Anderson, he believes that the Golden State Warriors, which arrive as consensus five-and-a-half-point favorites for the series opener, are the correct side to back tonight. The reasoning? Dating back to 2015, the Warriors hold a near-impeccable record in series openers. Odds provided by Caesars Spread: DAL +5.5 (-110) vs. GSW -5.5 (-110) Moneyline: DAL (+185) vs. GSW (-225) Total: Over 214.5 (-110) | Under 214.5 (-110) “Since the [2015] postseason, the Golden State Warriors in Game 1 are 20-2 straight-up,” Anderson explains. Additionally, the Warriors have dominated teams against the spread in Game 1’s played on its home floor. Across that same span (2015-2022), the Warriors are 8-2 against the spread as a single-digit home favorite and have covered by an average of 6.4 points per game in those 10 contests. Anderson also believes that the Mavericks defense will struggle to contain a potent Warriors offense, another reason he believes Golden State will cover. “[Golden State makes] a lot of back-cuts [and] there’s a lot of movement – you’re chasing Steph [Curry], you’re chasing [Jordan] Poole all over the court,” Anderson says.  Add in that the Dallas defense will likely have tired legs after finishing a seven-game series against Phoenix and Anderson believes the Warriors to have their way and claim Game 1.
