Patrick Beverley continues to catch heat for his ESPN appearances this week. Beverley, who called Chris Paul a “cone” on defense earlier this week, was repudiated by Damian Lillard and Matt Barnes for the remarks. Sixers guard Danny Green, speaking with NBC Sports Philadelphia for a show coming out this weekend, got in on the lashing as well. “Bro, people target you too, Pat Bev. You ain’t playing no f–king defense out there,” Green said. “You ain’t stopping Luka! Time and time again I’ve seen Luka point at you and say, ‘Little man! He’s too f–king small!’ and go right at you every chance he got. When you play Luka, you’re a cone too.” Green’s Spurs defeated Beverley’s Rockets in the 2017 Western Conference semifinals. Every current and former player who comes at Beverley for his comments on Chris Paul is only raising the Timberwolves guard’s media stock — nothing is more valuable than having your name resonate in the news.
