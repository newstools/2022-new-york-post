Elon Musk mocked Apple’s return-to-office policy on Twitter Wednesday with a meme of an obese dog taking a nap. Apple said it Tuesday was pushing back its requirement that employees work in-person three days per week due to coronavirus concerns. Employees are still required to come into the office twice per week. In response to a news story about Apple’s move, Musk posted a meme Wednesday that seemed to imply Apple employees are lazy. “PUT ON GYM CLOTHES,” reads the meme, which features a picture of a fat dog sleeping. “WATCH TV.” The Post reported in April that Apple employees were angry about CEO Tim Cook’s return to office push, with one ranting online: “I don’t give a single f—k about ever coming back to work here.” Then in May, a top executive in Apple’s artificial intelligence division quit over the company’s return to office policy. He was scooped up weeks later by Google, which has looser in-person work requirements than Apple. Musk, who has described himself as a hands-on “nano-manager,” has taken a derisive tone toward remote work. Days after Musk took a 9% stake in Twitter this April, he suggested converting Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter “since no one shows up anyway” — a jab at the company’s loose remote work policy. Musk has also repeatedly taken shots at Apple, calling its app store fees a “30% tax on the internet” and parodying a $19 Apple polishing cloth. He has also claimed in 2020 that he previously tried to approach Cook about buying Tesla — but that Cook refused to take the meeting.
