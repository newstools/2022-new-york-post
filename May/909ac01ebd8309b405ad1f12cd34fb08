Google has plans to launch a new ‘time travel’ feature for its Street View application. To celebrate its 15th birthday, Google’s Street View is allowing users to travel back in time via a new tool. Specifically, this tool will let users see how landscapes have changed over the years — straight from their phones. To make the feature even more fun, Google has curated a list of popular places that users can explore. The top three areas on the list are The White House at Christmas, followed by The Taj Mahal, and then the Floating Market in Thailand. Users can also take a ride in Space, virtually visit Japan’s Famous Cherry Blossom, or check out Yosemite National Park. Rounding on the list is world-famous attractions like the Great Barrier Reef, the Eiffel Tower, the Venice Canals, and the Colorado River (in a boat!) Google Street View is a revolutionary technology utilized in Google Maps and Google Earth that lets users interact with many streets around the globe. In fact, over the last 15 years, Street View cars have traveled over 10 million miles around more than 100 countries and territories. Throughout their travels, the fleet of cars has collected more than 220 billion images, making it possible for us to use Street View. This new update comes just weeks after a similar ‘timelapse’ tool was released for Google Earth. The clever time lapse feature lets users see how neighborhoods have changed over the last 37 years. Googler sourced more than 24 million satellite photos taken over four decades for the tool. This feature aims to show “not just problems but also solutions,” per a Google blog post.
