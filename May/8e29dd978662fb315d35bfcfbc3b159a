With the Nets announcing that Ben Simmons underwent successful back surgery this week — microdiscectomy surgery Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Marina Del Rey Hospital in Los Angeles, to be specific — it begs the question of where things stand now with Brooklyn and their injured young star? What will Simmons be doing this summer? How did things get to this point? And where do he and the Nets go from here? Sports+ put together a complete timeline to chronicle what’s gone on and what’s next for Simmons, from how he ended up moving from Philadelphia to Brooklyn in the first place to the road he’ll have to travel to make his Nets debut. June 20: This was the last time Simmons actually played, when he struggled in Philadelphia’s second-round loss to Atlanta. The spring had already brought its share of complications for Simmons, who was navigating some family drama involving his sister and half brother back in Australia, of which the 76ers were aware. Four days later, agent Rich Paul started talks with the team about his future.
