An older Indian couple desperate for grandkids is suing their son and daughter-in-law, demanding that they produce an offspring within a year — or pay them the equivalent of $675,000. Sanjeev Ranjan Prasad, a 61-year-old retired government officer, said it was an emotional and sensitive issue for him and his wife, Sadhana Prasad, and they cannot wait for grandchildren any longer. The Prasads’ son, who works as a pilot, was married six years ago. “We want a grandson or a granddaughter within a year or compensation, because I have spent my life’s earnings on my son’s education,” Sanjeev told reporters Thursday. Prasad said he spent 3.5 million rupees, which is about $47,300, for his son’s pilot training in the US. “The main issue is that at this age we need a grandchild, but these people [my son and daughter-in-law] have an attitude that they don’t think about us,’” Sanjeev said. “We got him married in the hope we would have the pleasure of becoming grandparents. It has been six years since their marriage,” Sanjeev said. “It feels as if despite having everything we have nothing.” The court accepted the peeved parents’ complaint and scheduled a hearing next Monday in Haridwar, a city in northern Uttarakhand state, media reports said. Sanjeev said he and his wife love children. “We are not getting love and affection from where we want it the most,” he said. “I feel very unlucky.” With Post Wires
