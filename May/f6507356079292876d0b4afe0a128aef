Doug Larsen, Staten Island, after the Rangers dropped both games in Carolina. “All weekend I had a line from Joni Mitchell’s song as an earworm — that we got to get ourselves back to the Garden.” Let Go Rangers, Doug. Cubs vs. Reds?! I haven’t been this excited since ABC decided to renew “Celebrity Family Feud!” The two clubs are in rebuild mode. The Cubs since 2020. The Reds since 1990 when Eric Davis and Barry Larkin were fielding grounders and shagging flies. Marcus Stroman throws for Chicago. Stroman, never short on confidence, has come up well short of expectations. He’s been better lately, allowing two runs over 12 innings. Cincinnati’s Tyler Mahle has given up three runs over his last 12 frames. Pitching matchup is a wash. The Cubs are somewhat better and are playing .500 ball on the road. Play 10 units on the Cubbies. Let the good times roll. Phillies 7, Bravos 3. Rhys Hoskins with three RBIs. Zach Wheeler went 6 ²/₃ for the W. Phantastic. Up +438 delunsers.
