A palatial California abode with breathtaking ocean views was just “one signature away” from being sold for nearly $10 million when it was gutted by the Laguna Beach wildfire this week, according to its real estate agent. The mansion’s owner was abroad at the time — and watched helplessly as security cameras showed the property being destroyed. The 10,000-square-foot pad — known as the crown jewel of a luxury gated neighborhood in Laguna Niguel — “burnt to a crisp” as the wind-fueled brush fire ripped through the ritzy region,  the listing agent told the Orange County Register. “It’s a very special property. You cannot duplicate that home,” said realtor Leo Goldschwartz. “The house had separate wings. The adults went one way, the kids went another way. … It was like a palace. The house was a really beautiful home. The finishes were impressive.” The custom-built house, on the top of a ridge in the Coronado Pointe neighborhood, had a pool, an elegant parking area and canyon-side twin wings overlooking the beach. Built in 1999, it was designed by a French architect with feng shui values and likely the priciest home in the gated community. “It’s a very exclusive neighborhood … very quiet,” Goldschwartz said. “It’s an under-the-wire, luxury community that’s little known.” At least 11 homes were damaged and 20 destroyed by the fast-moving wildfire that overtook the tony Southern California area Wednesday, fire officials said. Prices for the fire-ravaged homes along Coronado Pointe ranged from $2.8 million to $9.6 million, according to the most recent Zillow estimates. Most of them were 4,000 to 6,000 square feet. The owner of the $10 million mansion, who also has a home in Canada, was insured, Goldschwartz said — although wildfires have made insurance harder to get and more expensive in California. The abode’s would-be buyers are devastated, he said.
