Moments before Minnesota police arrested Julissa Thaler, 28, in the death of her 6-year-old son Eli Hart, officers found blood in her car but drove her home without further incident. Her excuse: the blood was from a tampon and the flesh found on her body and in the seats was from a deer she picked up from a butcher, new documents show, FOX 9 of Minneapolis reported. In the new documents, Orono police officers said they located Thaler’s car after they were initially notified about a car with a smashed window driving on a flat tire. During the traffic stop, Orono officers said they found what appeared to be blood on her person and additional blood and bits of flesh in the car, FOX Minneapolis reported. The officers also saw a bullet hole in the car and shell casings, but none of those details resulted in them initially detaining Thaler, according to the documents. Instead, officers drove Thaler to her home while other officers who remained at the scene inspected the vehicle, according to the report. Officers then found the body of Thaler’s son in the trunk of the car. The body was found alongside a shotgun and an autopsy later revealed young Eli’s body was shot up to nine times, including his head, Fox 9 reported. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office subsequently charged Thaler with second-degree murder. Thaler’s boyfriend was in the car during the initial traffic stop and was taken into custody before he was released due to a lack of evidence to charge him.
