A federal judge in Manhattan Wednesday denied a “Hail Mary” effort by Democrats to reinstate gerrymandered congressional lines for the upcoming midterm elections after a ruling by New York’s highest court last week that declared them an illegal gerrymander under the state constitution. “I would be hard pressed to imagine a scenario that would cast into greater disrepute the rationality, the fairness, the consistency of the holding of elections in this great country than to precipitate that,” Judge Lewis Kaplan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said. He called the effort by Democrats a “Hail Mary.” Democrats had requested a temporary restraining order from Kaplan as the state gets ready ready to finalize the ballot for the June 28 primary for Assembly and statewide offices. Redistricting is a matter of national importance as Democrats continue efforts to defend their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House and Republicans seek to reclaim that majority. Party primaries for Congress and the state Senate are currently set for Aug. 23 following a ruling by the state Court of Appeals, which also upheld a decision by a lower court striking down new lines for the state Senate for procedural reasons. Court-appointed special master Jonathan Cervas has until May 20 to submit new maps for Congress and state Senate for court approval.
