An eagle-eyed TikToker has found shots of mythical and frightening creatures on Google Street View. A shocking Bigfoot look-a-like and giant snakes were spotted by Google’s cameras. The TikTok was posted by @googlemapsfun, a popular account with over eight million followers. “A Google Street View user was searching in the woods of Russia when he suddenly discovered something very mysterious,” the digitized voice-over said. The poster zoomed in on an ape-like figure that’s a dead giveaway for Bigfoot or Sasquatch. While some are intrigued by the video, the top comment is skeptical – a user wrote the Bigfoot figure is a “man in a bigfoot suit who knew Google was coming”. The video shifts countries and goes from Russian forests to the coast of France. A 30-meter spindly figure can be seen partially burrowed in the sand. Set to ominous music, the voice-over said “users believe this to be a giant snake … bigger than any snake ever caught before.” While it may be fun to believe, this “creature” is actually the Serpent d’océan, a massive aluminum sculpture set in the Loire River. The last portion of the video lands in Indonesia, a collection of islands north of Australia. A massive, curling figure is spotted just beneath the murky waters’ surface. One of the largest snakes ever recorded was a 23-foot reticulated python in Indonesia – the snake swallowed a woman whole. “If you don’t want to get attacked by giant snakes, I would suggest you do not visit these dangerous-seeming places,” the voiceover concluded. Spotting irregular occurrences and shady figures is a popular TikTok genre. @googlemapsfun’s video has over 225,000 likes on TikTok to date.
