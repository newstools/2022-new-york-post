Former Alabama jail boss Vicky White was hit with additional charges Monday for allegedly using an alias to purchase the distinctive getaway car used in convicted killer Casey Cole White’s escape. The charges of second-degree forgery and identity theft have now been added to the warrant for Vicky’s arrest, the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office said. The 56-year-old is accused of using a fake name to buy the orange 2007 Ford Edge that she and Casey, 38, allegedly used when they fled the Lauderdale County jail two weeks ago. The car was later found dumped on a rural Tennessee road just hours after their alleged escape. Vicky, the former assistant corrections director at the jail, is believed to have had a “jailhouse romance” with Casey — and helped him plan and execute the breakout, authorities said. Casey, who is covered in white supremacist tattoos, was awaiting trial in a capital murder case when he allegedly managed to break free. A nationwide manhunt has been ongoing since the pair vanished together on April 29 after Vicky allegedly told co-workers she was taking Casey to a mental health evaluation at the courthouse. Casey was captured on surveillance footage walking out of the jail and getting into Vicky’s sheriff’s cruiser. The two left in a patrol car, which was later found abandoned nearby in a parking lot where investigators believe Vicky had parked the getaway car. When Vicky failed to return that afternoon and didn’t answer her phone, authorities realized the pair were missing. They eventually learned the mental health evaluation had never been scheduled.
