Cheaters tend to leave evidence of their infidelity behind such as a sneaky text message or a forgotten piece of clothing. For one woman, it was something completely different – but she says it instantly revealed her boyfriend was cheating on her. In a video, a woman named Ximena Salazar shared exactly what gave it away that her boyfriend was being unfaithful. She wrote that she had been away visiting her family for a week but when she came home, she found all of her bathroom things underneath the sink. It would seem like her boyfriend was trying to hide the fact that she always lives there. Salazar also wrote in the video’s caption: “I didn’t even put two and two together at the time.” Meanwhile, in the comments sections, others shared similar stories about how they caught their boyfriend cheating. One wrote: “Yup. I was out of town for work and he put all my stuff in the guest bathroom downstairs because I was ‘his roommate.'” Another added: “My toothbrush was in the trash! His excuse ‘I was using it to clean?’ What? Her mouth out with soap?” Someone else commented: “One time I came home from work and all the pictures were off the walls and I asked why and the man said ‘oh I don’t know’ and I just … accepted that?” Salazar also added in a comment: “It’s easy to overlook the flags when you just assume the best in people.” On the bright side, Salazar said in the following video that although she is sad, she learned her worth through her experience with her boyfriend. She explained: “I’ve accepted sadness to be a part of this journey, but it will never be the main aspect of this journey because I choose to find joy within myself.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
