Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ripped comedian Trevor Noah for “lying” about his presence at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner last week, noting that his interest in the annual event is nil. Noah said the Republican firebrand was in the audience at one point during the show before tossing a few jabs at the phantom Floridian. “One of my favorites, Ron DeSantis, is here,” Noah declared. “Oh man, I’m actually surprised that he found the time. You know he has been so busy trying to outmaneuver Trump for 2024. I see you, Ron. I see you, player.” DeSantis clarified Monday that he was not present. “I would never attend that,” he said at an unrelated press conference in Jacksonville after being asked about Noah’s routine. “I have no interest in that.” DeSantis said he was perplexed by Noah’s “verifiable” falsehood and that it was a curious choice given the nature of the gathering. “Why they would want to perpetuate a lie about that I don’t know,” DeSantis said. “But I think it just shows you why that cabal of people in DC, NY is so reviled by so many Americans. I think it’s a reputation that’s been well-deserved.” Noah zinged DeSantis over several recent Florida controversies, including the state banning what the Department of Education deemed needlessly politicized math textbooks. He also cast him as an upgraded version of President Donald Trump. “You’re smarter than him, you’re slicker than him, you can walk down ramps,” Noah said. “Because you see, no, Trump said he won the election, but everyone was just able to look at the numbers and see he was wrong. That’s why Ron DeSantis is one step ahead, first you ban the math textbooks, then nobody knows how to count the votes. Boom, my man!” DeSantis said Monday that his office had received an invite to the event but that it was “rejected.”
