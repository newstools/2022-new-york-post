Justin Bieber called racism “diabolical” at a sold-out concert in Buffalo on Saturday night, just hours after a white supremacist killed 10 people at a local supermarket. The singer posted a clip of the performance on Instagram where he asked his screaming legion of fans to become allies in the fight against racism. “There’s so much division in this world,” the crooner told the crowd. “So much racial injustice. And as you and I both know, racism is evil, and it is diabolical. But what you and I get to do — we get to be difference makers.” Bieber urged attendees to start dialogues with friends and family over social justice issues. “We get to be the people who get to continue to have the conversations with our friends and our families and our loved ones,” he said. “We continue to be allies, to continue the conversation.” Bieber also posted a message along with the video clip. “RACISM WILL NOT PREVAIL GOD DOES,” Bieber wrote in all caps to his 235 million followers on the platform.  “WE STAND WITH YOU BUFFALO AND STAND AGAINST THIS RACIST ACT OF TERROR.” Earlier, Bieber posted reposted a message from associate and music producer Harv, who was also close to the carnage when it happened. “That could’ve been me because I’m a BLACK living in America. Why is there so much hate?? This is [an] evil cycle that is on a loop,” the original message stated. Payton Gendron, 18, allegedly traveled 200 miles from his family’s home to a supermarket in a predominately black neighborhood where he shot 13 people, leaving 10 dead.
