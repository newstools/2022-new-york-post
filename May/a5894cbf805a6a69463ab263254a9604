About $14 million in cocaine was found near the body of a diver who washed up on a riverbank in Australia, according to cops. “We are trying to identify whether the two incidents are linked,” said New South Wales Detective Superintendent Robert Critchlow to reporters, as cops announced they were investigating the incident Tuesday. “They may well be, but we are open-minded as to the options in front of us.” The drug cache entailed about 110 pounds of the white powder, which was found in several packages near the unidentified dead man, who was wearing high-end diving equipment, authorities said. The diver’s body was discovered Monday on the banks of Hunter River in Newcastle, north of Sydney. Divers will continue to search the surrounding area alongside officers from the Australian Border Force as part of an ongoing probe, officials said. With Post wires
