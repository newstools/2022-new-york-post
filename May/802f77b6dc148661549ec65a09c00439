A TikToker is revealing some of the questions she gets asked as a female employee at a GameStop store. TikToker @ikissedsafiree said that a lot of shoppers are surprised that she works there and knows a lot about video games. Her TikTok was set to the viral sound “Miami, My Amy,” by Keith Whitley. The video starts with the caption “being a girl and working at GameStop.” It then runs through a series of questions she has been asked at work. Text over a photo of a man shows the question: “When did you start working here? What’s your gamer tag?” Other questions included: “Are you sure you know what you’re talking about?” “Do you have GTA-5?” Other TikTokers commented, sharing similar experiences from their time at GameStop. “Worked for GS for 9 years,” @thejetttt commented. “Was an ASM. Can confirm this is how the female employees were treated. I usually stepped in if I could.” Another TikToker, @nes.ttv has also been documenting her experience as a female employee at the video game store. Some commenters on TikTok were actually surprised by that the comments weren’t very offensive. “That’s far less sexist than I thought it was going to be,” wrote one user. Others supported @ikissedsafiree, writing “you are not alone.” “OMG I swear I’ve witnessed all of these comments just browsing at GameStop, you guys really need a raise,” another commenter said.
