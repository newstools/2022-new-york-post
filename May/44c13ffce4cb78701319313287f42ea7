Kelsey Wingert, a reporter for the Rockies, is on the mend after she “took a 95 mph line drive” to the forehead in Colorado’s 7-6 loss to the San Francisco Giants on Monday. Wingert took to Twitter on Wednesday after she was treated at a hospital following the hit, and shared a photo of a vertical gash in the middle of her forehead that was stitched up. “Checking in – Monday, I took a 95 MPH line drive to my head,” Wingert tweeted. “The @Rockies & @ATTSportsNetRM have treated me like family. Getting me treatment & to the best hospital ASAP. I was at hospital for 5 hours w/ David Woodman (GM of AT&T SN), his wife, Paula & my producer Alison Vigil.” In a follow-up tweet, Wingert shared that she had a CT scan to check for internal bleeding and fractures, which came back clear. “Thank God. I received internal & external stitches. I’ve been staying at my GM’s house,” the reporter tweeted. “I can’t say enough about AT&TSN & the Rox. I’ve never experienced support like this. Thank you for the prayers.” After being hit with the foul ball, Wingert was seen standing while she received medical attention in the Rockies’ dugout. On Monday, AT&T SportsNet in Colorado tweeted, “Reporter @KelsWingert was hit by a foul ball during Monday’s Rockies game. Kelsey immediately received medical attention and we’re happy to share that she’s doing well under the circumstances. We’re wishing Kelsey a speedy recovery and we’ll see her soon on the @Rockies broadcast.” Wingert has been a trooper throughout her MLB career. In 2018, she suffered a fractured eye socket after being hit with a foul ball while working as a sideline reporter for the Atlanta Braves and Fox Sports South. After Monday’s loss to the Giants, the Rockies fell to San Fransisco 10-7 on Tuesday. Colorado came back to beat the Giants 5-3 on Wednesday. The Rockies kick off a three-game series at home against the Mets on Friday.
