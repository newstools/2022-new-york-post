For shopping fans, there’s nothing quite like perusing through the aisles of Target, however, a major haul doesn’t make for easy transportation. Thankfully, there’s a simple solution built right into Target bags that makes shopping hassle-free. A Target superfan named Jamie shared her genius trick to making sure all of her items are nice and secured in a video. Unfortunately, the trick only works with the new, canvas Target bags and not the plastic ones. In the video, Jamie simply takes the straps through the holes at the top of the bag and pulls them tightly shut. This closes the bag in a matter of moments, making it that much easier to haul all of your goods to your home. People in the comments section were very grateful to Jaime for sharing this useful trick. One wrote: “New Jersey people thank you, I was wondering what the holes were for.” Another added: “Wish I saw this yesterday when I was carrying my open bags on the bus.” Someone else commented: “TikTok with another lesson,” while another quipped: “Wait that’s so cool.” Meanwhile, one person pointed out that the holes at the top of the Target bags have a different use. They wrote: “The holes are used for when they hang them on the stand like they did the plastic bags.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
