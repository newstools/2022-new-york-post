No one is having a more exciting offseason than Matthew Stafford and his wife, Kelly. Over the weekend, the Rams’ Super Bowl-winning quarterback attended Game 4 of the Los Angeles Kings’ first-round NHL playoffs series against the Edmonton Oilers, where he and Kelly watched from a suite at Crypto.com Arena. Joined by the newly retired Andrew Whitworth, Stafford, 34, was first seen wearing a mullet wig on the Jumbotron, with Kelly briefly appearing in the background. Later in the game, Kelly stole the show with a solo appearance on the Jumbotron in which she’s seen waving a towel and busting a move. Following Sunday’s game, in which the Kings shut out the Oilers, 4-0, Kelly elaborated on her performance during the most recent episode of her podcast, “The Morning After with Kelly Stafford.” “The dance cam came on, and obviously I love a good dance — not good at it, by any means — but probably my best performance,” Kelly quipped Tuesday. “They did get me on their twice. The first time I didn’t even realize it, the second time I did realize it, and they left it on a little too long, like to the point where I was getting, ‘OK, next person, please,’ but I was having a good time.” The Staffords have been living it up in recent months following the Rams’ Super Bowl win over the Bengals in February. From a trip to Las Vegas, to an NBA date night, and, most recently, a weekend at the Stagecoach music festival with NFL reporters and fellow podcasters, Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson, the couple is certainly enjoying every moment of this whirlwind victory lap. The Staffords have been married since 2015 and have four daughters together. Recently, the quarterback signed a four-year, $160 million contract extension with the Rams, whom he was traded to in January 2021 after 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions.
