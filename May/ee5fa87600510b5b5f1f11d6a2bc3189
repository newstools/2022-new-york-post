Paige Spiranac is getting real about her social media persona. While taking part in an Instagram Q&A on Monday, the “Playing A Round” podcast host was asked, “What was the turning point for you when social media become [sic] what you owned instead of feared?” Spiranac then explained how she was able to “detach” herself from the hateful commentary and lean into the “Paige Renee” her 3.3 million followers love. “I really struggled with the negative comments at first but then I realized that they don’t know me, the true, real me. They just know this persona, this character that I play, and so, I was able to detach myself from the negative comments and really just have so much fun with it,” she said in an Instagram Story. Spiranac then elaborated further on how the “Paige Renee” fans see on her Instagram page is the “most fun, sexy, confident version” of herself. “And when I say this character that I play, I always try to be very authentic and genuine, but this is just one facet of my personality. So this ‘Paige Renee’ character is the most fun, sexy, confident version of myself and that’s what I like to put out on social media,” she continued in a separate Instagram Story. Though Spiranac frequently shares sultry snaps from the course, the 29-year-influencer has also pulled back the curtain on different areas of her life, ranging from matters of the heart to the shocking DMs she receives on the regular. Recently, however, Spiranac spoke about a more light-hearted life change: switching up her hairstyle. “I’ve had a very difficult relationship with bangs. I’ve had this feeling that I can just pull off bangs my entire life and I never could,” Spiranac said on a recent installment of her podcast, adding how a photo of Hailey Bieber served as inspiration that she “wanted to do bangs again.” Spiranac revealed the new look on Instagram last week with her fans — unsurprisingly — dropping a slew of heart-eyed emojis in the comments.
