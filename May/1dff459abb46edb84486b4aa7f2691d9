The Washington Capitals pulled off the biggest upset of the first two days of the NHL postseason, defeating the Florida Panthers, 4-2, as +200 underdogs in Game 1. The victory was well-earned for the Capitals, who generated 4.11 expected goals and conceded only 2.21 at all strengths. Florida remains a robust -175 favorite to win the series, but a stumble in Game 2 on Thursday would see that number shorten drastically. The Capitals are one of the best road teams in the NHL and their style of play translates well in a matchup with the Panthers, who feel most comfortable in back-and-forth contests. Washington is adept at gumming up the neutral zone, which makes Florida’s preferred up-tempo, transition style much harder to pull off. A team that can tighten things up against the Panthers takes away their biggest strength. Often in the NHL playoffs, bookmakers will adjust numbers based on a “must-win” narrative. It’s hard to fathom the Presidents’ Trophy winners going down 0-2 in the first round, so it’s quite possible that the Capitals will close at a higher price than they did for Game 1. Washington has already proven that it can hang with the Panthers, so don’t be afraid to back the Capitals at a big number once again on Thursday night. The play: Capitals +200.
