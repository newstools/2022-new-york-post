An elderly man was slugged in the face while riding an A train in Manhattan on Sunday — the latest violent attack on the city’s subway system. The 73-year-old man was riding a northbound A train when he was punched in the face by a teenager at around 4 p.m., according to police. The teen hit the older man after the two got into an argument as the train neared Chambers Street. EMS rushed the victim to Bellevue Hospital. The suspect hopped off the train and fled the scene. No arrested were immediately made on Sunday. The assault follows a recent string of violent — and sometimes — deadly subway attacks. Hours earlier on Sunday, a 48-year-old man was shot dead in a random and unprovoked killing on a Q train in Manhattan. Police are still searching for the suspect responsible for the shooting and have pushed additional officers onto the transit system.
