Kate Upton certainly brought the heat to Instagram this week. The three-time Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model shared a sultry snap on Wednesday that featured her modeling a white bikini against a tropical backdrop. Upton’s post unsurprisingly caught the eye of many on social media, including husband Justin Verlander. The Astros pitcher, 39, not only doubled-tapped his wife’s photo, but he dropped the heart-eyed smiley face emoji in the comments, as well as a fire animation. Verlander and Upton, who have been married since 2017 and share 3-year-old daughter Genevieve, frequently get playful with one another on social media. Earlier this year, the two-time Cy Young Award winner channeled his inner swimsuit model as he struck a pose aboard a yacht. “Not the only swimsuit model in the family,” Verlander quipped in January. Weeks later, Verlander also joked about coordinating outfits with Upton during a night out. Prior to the start of the 2022 MLB season, Verlander — who rejoined the Astros late last year — sharpened his skillset in the special effects space by helping to direct Upton’s Celine Dion-inspired music video. In a post shared on Instagram in January, Verlander can be seen adjusting the lighting for Upton’s shot and waving a cardboard box to create wind. “It takes a village.. and some wine,” Upton captioned the post. Verlander has since returned to the mound, with the Astros currently leading the AL West at 24-14.
