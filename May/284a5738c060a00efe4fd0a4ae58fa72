The Golden State Warriors have another chance to close out the Dallas Mavericks tonight as it brings a 3-1 series lead back to the Bay Area. Game 5 between the two teams tips off at 9:00 p.m. ET on TNT. But before tonight’s Western Conference Finals Game 5 tips off, Raheem Palmer of the Action Network is here to share his best bet for the contest. Rather than backing either side, Palmer is choosing to back the total tonight, specifically over 215.5 points. Palmer believes that both sides are capable of lighting up the scoreboard and, with the Mavericks experiencing some positive offensive regression, the game will be wide open. Odds courtesy of BetMGM Plus, Palmer explains that the Warriors have demonstrated an ability to score efficiently from close-range. “The Warriors continue to shoot 60 percent from two-point range,” Palmer says. “Running this team off the three-point line doesn’t work because they can get anything they want in two-point range.” Add in the efficiency of Steph Curry, Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson from beyond the arc — the trio has combined to shoot 38.4 percent from deep this series, with Curry leading the way at 46 percent — and Palmer expects the Warriors will score points with ease.  The last element of this handicap by Palmer is that in order to win, the Mavericks will need to score a lot of points, which will open it up on the defensive end. For those reasons, Palmer recommends taking the over 215.5 points, a benchmark these teams have cleared in two of the last three games.
