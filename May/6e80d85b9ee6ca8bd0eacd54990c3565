Shocking video captures the moment a duo brutally beat a man in the middle of a Manhattan street – in front of passing drivers — leaving him with a fractured skull. The 46-year-old victim was standing at the corner of East Fourth Street and Second Avenue in the East Village around 3:40 a.m. May 18 when he was attacked by two men, back-to-back, authorities said. Video released by the NYPD on Tuesday shows the victim standing at the corner when the first assailant, wearing a white shirt, comes up behind him, grabs him by his clothing and drags him backwards onto the ground in the crosswalk. Then the suspect punches the victim in the face as he lies helpless in the street, the footage shows. The video then cuts to the victim standing up again — at which time another man knocks him to the ground. The suspect then punches the victim and stands over him for a moment before dragging him closer to the curb. At least seven cars — including a taxi that appears toward the end of the clip — pass down the block during the heinous attack. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he is listed in critical condition with a skull fracture. His injuries are so serious that he has not been able to speak to authorities about the circumstances leading up to the attack, cops said. Both suspects, who cops say have a light complexion and are between 25 and 35 years old, fled after the attack. Police are still looking to track them down.
