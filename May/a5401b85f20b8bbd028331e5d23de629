A woman in love with a plane insists her desire is not a flight of fancy. Sarah Rodo, 23, even refers to the Boeing 737 as her boyfriend. She flies on the aircraft as often as possible and has 50 replica models of the plane at home. Sarah calls the Boeing Dicki and hopes to wed one day, even though it is illegal in Germany. The Dortmund resident identifies as an Objectum Sexual, meaning that she is sexually attracted to inanimate objects. She said past romances with men didn’t get her flying high. She has also been in love with a train. Sarah said: “My plane is called Dicki. “I love everything about him, but particularly his face, wings and engine — they’re so sexy to me. “Some people don’t understand my love but my friends took my coming-out very well and encouraged me.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
