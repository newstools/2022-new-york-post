The past day has been “absolutely nuts” for Claire Couv Smith, the wife of Texas Rangers prospect Josh Smith, who made his MLB debut on Monday night. The 24-year-old infielder was called up to the majors from the Round Rock Triple-A club, with Brad Smith injured. For Monday’s game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Couv Smith watched from Globe Life Field, as she chronicled her husband’s big night. “Y’all, the last 24 hours have been absolutely nuts,” Couv Smith said in an Instagram story. “I am literally in Arlington, Texas, right now — fully suited up for tonight. Josh is starting at third. We’re so excited!” Couv Smith continued the social media celebrations in honor of her favorite Ranger, whom the Yankees drafted with the 67th overall pick in 2019. “Your dreams came true,” Couv Smith gushed. “Go kill it @joshsmth8.” Smith had a night to remember, recording three hits in the Rangers’ 9-5 win over the Rays. Following the game, Couv Smith made her way to the field for a sweet selfie with Smith. “Can’t even believe that just happened and that we’re on this field together rn [right now]!!!” Couv Smith captioned an Instagram story as the duo shared a kiss in the outfield. Hours later, Couv Smith thanked fans for their sweet support, even showing off the souvenir Smith received: the ball of his first major league hit. “It’s crazy to see how many ppl actually cared about Josh’s debut and turned on the tv to watch & support him. Never did we ever think we would have a community like this who cared so much but we are so damn thankful to say the least,” she wrote, adding that Monday was “truly the best day ever.” Smith — who has been married to Couv Smith since 2021 — landed in Texas last summer as part of a multi-player trade, with the Yankees receiving Joey Gallo and Joely Rodriguez.
