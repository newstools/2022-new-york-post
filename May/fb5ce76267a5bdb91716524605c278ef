The mother of a teenager killed in a freak sand hole collapse on the Jersey Shore said Wednesday that she’s trying to accept the heartbreaking loss. “It is what it is. You can’t change it,” Angela Caverly, of Union, Maine, told NJ.com of her 18-year-old son Levi Caverly’s death. The distraught mom said the family was on a trip to Toms River’s Ocean Beach 3 Tuesday when her son and 17-year-old daughter dug a 10-foot-deep hole that suddenly caved in and crushed Levi to death. She said her daughter, who was buried up to her neck, was well enough to drive them home to Maine, according to the outlet. “Physically, my daughter is OK. She’s helping drive us home right now,” Angela Caverly said. Levi Caverly was home-schooled, had three siblings and had recently been teaching himself computer programming, she said. “He was trying to learn computer coding, self-taught. He loved music and was playing drums in a praise band at our church,” his mom said. “We did home school and [2021] was his last year.” Angela Caverly — a devout church-goer who has worked at a Baptist church in Maine, according to her Facebook page — said she’s finding comfort in her faith and in the rescuers who rushed to help her son. “We had lots of people trying to help and we’re very grateful for that,” Angela Caverly told NJ Advance Media on Wednesday. “We know he’s with Jesus and smiling down on us.” The family rented a house in Toms River to be near the ocean earlier this week, she said. They spent most of the day on the beach Tuesday afternoon on the beach before tragedy struck. The siblings spent hours digging a hole in the sand with frisbees before it collapsed, police said.
