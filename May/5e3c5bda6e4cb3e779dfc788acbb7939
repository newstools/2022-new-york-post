Disgraced former NBC anchor Matt Lauer, 64, has finally found a buyer his Hamptons mansion, The Post has learned exclusively. The former “Today” host — who was fired from NBC nearly five years ago after facing allegations of sexual misconduct — bought the home on Actors Colony Road in North Haven, NY, from actor Richard Gere for $36.5 million in 2016. (Gere had originally listed the estate for $65 million in 2013.) Lauer first listed the property for $44.8 million in 2019, the year he finalized his divorce from Annette Roque, 55. It spent time on and off the market, and he most recently brought it back for sale in 2021 for $43.99 million. It closed for a yet to be disclosed price. The estate includes a main house, known as Strongheart Manor, built in 1902 that has been renovated and is now energy-efficient and geothermal, as well as a guest house — for a total of 12 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. There’s also a pond with a bridge and a tea house. The main house features a wraparound screened porch, a large kitchen, formal living and dining rooms and multiple fireplaces. There’s also a 60-foot heated gunite pool with water views, landscaped gardens, specimen trees, a gym and a basketball court. The gated estate sits on 6.3 acres and boasts views of the Peconic waterways and Mashomack Preserve, with 300 feet of direct bay frontage, a 240-foot-long private deepwater dock and a sandy beach. Neighbors include the singer Jimmy Buffett. The sale doesn’t mean Lauer is leaving the Hamptons. He still owns a 25-acre estate nearby in Sag Harbor. Roque will also keep Bright Side Farm, which the former couple bought for $3.5 million in 2012. Listing broker Susan Breitenbach, of Corcoran, was not available for comment.
