The betting market viewed the Bruins-Hurricanes series as a coin flip, with Carolina getting the slightest edge for home-ice advantage. Twelve days later, not all that much has changed as the teams prepared to meet Saturday in Game 7, with the Canes priced as the favorite on home ice. And while not one of the games has been close (there hasn’t been a one-goal game yet), the overall series numbers are quite tight. Carolina has the slight edge in goals scored, 21-18, but when you take out empty-net goals, it becomes a little tighter, at 18-16. The Canes have also outscored the B’s, 13-9, at 5-on-5, but the expected goals favor Boston 10.5 to 9.3. In other words, even if the games haven’t been nail-biters, this series deserves a Game 7, as neither side has separated itself from the other through six games. Although the Bruins have yet to break through on the road, you have to be impressed with the way they’ve fought to stay alive. Down 2-0 and then again 3-2, the B’s have responded with impressive wins each and every time. One of those wins came with Boston missing its top two defensemen. This game is a coin flip, so the plus-money price on Boston is worth a bet. The play: Bruins +110
