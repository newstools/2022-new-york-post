Looking ahead to Game 2, which will tip off on Friday, May 20 at 9:00 p.m. ET on TNT, there are more than a few ways that bettors could look to wager on this meeting. But, two prop bets stick out as must-plays. All odds courtesy of BetMGM. A key reason that the Warriors are back in the Western Conference Finals after a two-year hiatus is the emergence of Poole as a legitimate scoring threat. He’s been doing it all season, averaging 18.5 points per game, knocking down 44.8% of his shots, shooting a respectable 36.4% from three, and is automatic at the free throw line at 92.5%. His scoring prowess has only been elevated in the playoffs. In 12 playoff games, Poole is averaging 19.3 points on a 51.3% field goal percentage. Poole has averaged 13.3 field goal attempts and 3.3 free throw attempts per game, giving him plenty of volume to put up numbers. This number feels very much in range for him in Game 2.  Green is an important asset for the Warriors, and the forward has played in a whopping 135 career playoff games. That experience matters. Despite averaging a career 6.9 rebounds per game player, he has continuously pushed his numbers to new heights in the postseason. Green averages 9.2 rebounds per game in the postseason. While that number is down slightly at 7.3 rebounds per game in this year’s playoffs, he has topped nine rebounds in four of his last six games, including posting nine rebounds in 28:50 in Game 1. Green will have fresh legs for Game 2, and the Warriors out-rebounded Dallas 51-35 in the series opener.
