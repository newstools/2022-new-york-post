There were no gripes from Giants fans at the top of the 2022 NFL Draft. They got themselves a potentially elite pass rusher in Kayvon Thibodeaux. Then they got themselves a starting right tackle in Evan Neal. The rest of the draft can be up for discussion, but it’s hard debating that Joe Schoen got two potential franchise-altering players in the first round that can hopefully start to change things in Giants land. To break down all the Giants picks, we bring you a new episode of the “Blue Rush” podcast with Lawrence Tynes and Paul Schwartz. Giants second-round pick Wan’Dale Robinson joined Paul and I in the second half of the show for a fun interview.
