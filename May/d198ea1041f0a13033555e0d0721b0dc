The Yankees’ good fortune has taken a stark turn with Giancarlo Stanton and Jonathan Loaisiga going on the injured list Wednesday. An MRI exam revealed a right calf strain that meant a trip to the 10-day IL for Stanton, who is hitting .285 with 11 homers and 35 RBIs. The Yankees also announced that Loaisiga would be going on the IL with right shoulder discomfort in another major blow to their bullpen. “He’s gone through some tests in the last couple of days,” manager Aaron Boone said. “Similar to what he dealt with last year, probably not as severe. Just feels like it’s probably something as a precaution we need to be smart here and take a couple of weeks and hopefully that’s all it is.” Loaisiga will join Aroldis Chapman and Chad Green as shelved top relievers. Stanton, who left Wednesday’s extra-inning win over the Orioles in the the seventh inning, told Boone he was feeling better on Thursday. But the manager still didn’t rule out an IL stint. Loaisiga has been shut down from throwing for the time being. Perhaps this break could be a reset for him. The right-hander has struggled this year, pitching to a 7.02 ERA in 16.2 innings with a 1.56 WHIP.
