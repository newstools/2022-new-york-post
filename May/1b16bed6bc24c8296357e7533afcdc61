The Maple Leafs’ destruction of the Lightning on Monday night got ugly and bloody in the third period. With Toronto well on its way to a 5-0 win in Game 1 of the NHL playoff first-round series, a line brawl broke out with Tampa Bay clearly frustrated by the one-sided affair. Corey Perry and Patrick Maroon were trying to bait Wayne Simmonds into a fight; Simmonds wasn’t having it. But Simmonds seemed to finally have enough as he later put his hands on Victor Hedman, which sparked a melee between all the players on the ice, with sticks and gloves strewn about. Lightning defenseman Jan Rutta appeared to get the worst of it, as his head was busted open after some blows from Morgan Reilly. Perry was fined $2,500 by the NHL on Tuesday for unsportsmanlike conduct, while Maroon and Simmonds were fined $2,250. “I thought we handled their physicality well,” Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said, via USA Today, “both in making plays and keeping the puck moving and not getting rattled by it, and then just standing our ground when the nonsense starts late in the third.” Before the series started, Keefe said he was expecting the matchup to be “borderline violent.” Andrei Vasilevskiy, the reigning Conn Smythe winner for the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Lightning, allowed five goals on 33 shots in the loss. Game 2 is set for Wednesday night in Toronto.
