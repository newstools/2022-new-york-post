The Big Apple’s going to bake this weekend. A sweltering heat wave will hit the city with temperatures expected to peak at nearly 90 degrees on Sunday, according to meteorologists. The city will start to sizzle Saturday afternoon when temperatures soar to a high of 88 degrees — followed by a high of 89 degrees on Sunday, according to Fox Weather meteorologist Samantha Thomas. “It gets hotter the farther inland you go, so if you want to avoid the heat, go to the beach,” Thomas told The Post. “This could be the first 90-degree day in a year, and that first day is a rude awakening. So take it extra slow, drink plenty of water and don’t forget to wear sunscreen.” The summer-like swelter will cool down by Sunday night when a thunderstorm is likely to strike and break up the heat, Thomas said. The weekend temps are roughly ten degrees hotter than average for New York City in late May. The record for Sunday’s date in Central Park of  96 degrees, set in 1941, won’t likely be broken — but heat upstate will likely shatter records, Thomas said. Albany’s weather is expected to peak at a high of 95 degrees Sunday,  3 degrees above the record set for the day in 1941. Forecasters on Friday also issued a heat advisory in much of the Tri-State area, including New Jersey, The Hudson Valley, and Connecticut.
