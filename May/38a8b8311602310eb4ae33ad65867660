A woman was stabbed Wednesday during a vicious broad-daylight attack in Manhattan that was captured on video. Footage obtained by The Post shows a man repeatedly plunging what appears to be a knife into the victim’s lower body at around 1 p.m. in front of 379 Eighth Ave. near West 29th St. in Chelsea, cops said. The woman then falls to the sidewalk in distress, as people walk around her, the chilling video shows. The victim was stabbed in the leg and rushed to Bellevue Hospital, cops said. Her condition wasn’t immediately available. The attacker, who was believed to be in his 20s, fled and was being sought by police. He was was wearing a black sweater, black sweatpants and a red head-covering. It wasn’t immediately clear if he knew the victim or what led up to the attack.
