The Washington Post deleted a tweet on Monday that wrongly indicated that George Floyd was “shot and killed” while in Minneapolis police custody two years ago. “On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was shot and killed in police custody,” read the tweet which appeared on the newspaper’s official Twitter account. The timestamp indicated that the tweet was posted at 9:42 p.m. Eastern time. “His death sparked outrage, wide scale protests and calls to change policing. Two years later, what has — or hasn’t changed?” Curtis Houck of the right-leaning Media Research Center posted a screenshot showing that the error was repeated in a Washington Post news story. The error was corrected a short time later, according to the news site Mediaite. Floyd is the 46-year-old black man who was arrested by four Minneapolis police officers on May 25, 2020. Bystander video showed one of the officers, Derek Chauvin, press his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes as he lay on the ground face-first. Floyd is heard in the video repeatedly saying that he was not able to breathe before eventually lost consciousness. A short time later, he was hauled into the police cruiser and driven to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Floyd’s death ignited massive demonstrations and protests nationwide, many of which turned violent as arsonists rioted and looted stores, shops, and businesses in some of the country’s largest cities. Chauvin was convicted and sentenced to prison for Floyd’s death, but he never used a gun to shoot him. Thomas Lane, one of the other three officers who was involved in Floyd’s fatal arrest, pleaded guilty last week to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. The New York Post has reached out to The Washington Post seeking comment on the errant tweet and reference to a fatal shooting.
