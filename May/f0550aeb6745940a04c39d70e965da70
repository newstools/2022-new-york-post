The Indianapolis 500 returns on Sunday, May 29 on NBC, with the green flag scheduled to wave at 12:45  p.m. Eastern. Before the race starts, here are the betting odds of each racer to win this year’s Indy 500, with odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook. Row 1- Scott Dixon, Alex Palou, Rinus VeeKayRow 2- Ed Carpenter, Marcus Ericsson, Tony KanaanRow 3- Pato O’Ward, Felix Rosenqvist, Romain GrosjeanRow 4- Takuma Sato, Will Power, Jimmie JohnsonRow 5- David Malukas, Josef Newgarden, Santino FerruciRow 6- Simon Pagenaud, J.R. Hildebrand, Conor DalyRow 7- Callum Ilott, Alexander Rossi, Graham RahalRow 8- Sage Karam, Marco Andretti, Devlin DeFrancescoRow 9- Colton Herta, Scott McLaughlin, Helio CastronevesRow 10- Kyle Kirkwood, Dalton Kellett, Juan Pablo MontoyaRow 11- Christian Lundgaard, Jack Harvey, Stefan Wilson Scott Dixon came away with pole position, which has produced more winners than any other grid spot in the race’s previous 105 runnings. 21 of the 105 winners started from the pole position. He’s the odds-on favorite for a reason. Helio Castrovance who became the fourth four-time winner of the Indy 500 with his victory last year, has history in his sights on Sunday. He would set the record for the most wins at the Indy 500 if he can pull off his fifth victory. Castrovance finds himself with long odds at +2200, and he will have to work out of the 9th row after qualifying. Racers starting beyond the 23rd spot have only produced four total winners in the history of the race, so his chances are slim. A familiar name to racing fans, NASCAR legend Jimmie Johnson will make his IndyCar debut at 46-years-old on Sunday. While IndyCar will be new to him, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is not — Johnson has four wins in the Brickyard 400. Johnson starts on the outside of Row 4 after kissing the wall in his qualification. Johnson is one of the most legendary racers to ever take the track — and I’m not one to count him out in his newest venture.
