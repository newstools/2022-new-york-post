The knife-wielding maniac who allegedly threatened to behead a straphanger on a packed Manhattan train over the weekend turned himself in Thursday, authorities said. Aaron Ramos, 26, surrendered to cops shortly before noon in connection to the frightening incident that unfolded around 3:30 p.m. Sunday on a southbound No. 6 subway in the East 77th Street and Lexington Avenue station on the Upper East Side, cops said. The armed suspect followed a 35-year-old man into the crowded car and became irate as the train left the station, holding a switchblade in plain view, cops said. “I’m not riding this train pressed up against this door,” Ramos allegedly yelled, as he repeatedly flicked the blade in and out in the victim’s direction. “I’ll take your head off your f—–g neck.” The victim blocked the knifeman, keeping him at a distance from the other commuters, cops said. When the southbound train arrived at the 68th Street/Lexington Avenue subway station, the suspect fled. No injuries were reported. Ramos, of the Bronx, was charged with menacing, according to police.
