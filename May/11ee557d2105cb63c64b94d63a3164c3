Shocking new video captures the moment a trio brutally beat a woman – breaking her jaw – during a dust-up in the Bronx. The 37-year-old victim was arguing with a man at the northwest corner of Lydig Avenue and White Plains Road in Pelham Parkway around 9:15 p.m. May 18 when the squabble came to blows, cops said. Footage released early Wednesday shows two men shoving the woman, sending her falling backwards onto the sidewalk. All three repeatedly punched and kicked her – and one even dealt a single final kick in the face as the woman tried to sit up, the clip shows. The victim, who suffered a broken jaw in the attack, was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where she was treated and released. Police are still looking for all three suspects. One is described as having a medium complexion and medium build, with brown eyes and short dark hair. He was last seen wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with a graphic on the front stating “Legends never die,” a blue baseball cap, gray sweatpants, a red backpack and white sneakers. The second suspect has a medium complexion and slim build, with brown eyes and short, close-cut dark hair, cops said. He wore a blue, white and red hooded sweatshirt, a light-colored baseball cap, blue jeans, a black backpack and boots. Police are also looking for another man with a medium complexion and medium build, with brown eyes and short dark hair. During the attack, he wore a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, a red T-shirt, dark-colored pants and white sneakers.
