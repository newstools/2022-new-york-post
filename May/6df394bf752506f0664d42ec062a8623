How soon is too soon to commit to someone you’ve gone out with? Social media user Carrie Pyle posted a video explaining what happened on her disaster date. She said that she and a man met at a wine bar and had a really great first date. “He was a gentleman,” she said. “I thought it was a great first date.” Though she claimed she usually doesn’t see guys two days in a row, they went on a second date the following day. “Second date comes along and it’s equally as good.” Pyle found out that the man is too divorced like her, giving them something in common. Despite being divorced for over four years, he told Pyle that this was his first date since being with his wife. Pyle explained that she learned a lot about herself throughout her time dating, and she knows better than to commit to someone after just two dates. “I got to get to know them and figure out who they are before I” commit to them.” When she urged him to get back out and date around, he said: “Well why do I need to do that when I found you?” “I just love you,” he told her. “Like I want to hear that, but it seems a little fast,” she said. The woman said she got a creepy feeling inside and found herself pulling away from the man. Rather than ghosting him after his fast confession, she told him that the feelings talk and his level of commitment were freaking her out. Many viewers of the video were shocked at his quick catch of feelings, saying: “Confessing love on a second date is a red flag.” and “RUN.” “Premature declarations are a reflection of immaturity. Mature love takes time.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
