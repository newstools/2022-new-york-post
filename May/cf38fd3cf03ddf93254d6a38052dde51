TobyKeith the Chihuahua had a quick reign as the world’s oldest living dog, but that’s before Guinness World Records met Pebbles the toy fox terrier. The 4-pound pup from Taylors, South Carolina, is now the oldest dog alive at 22 years and 59 days old. Pebbles’ parents, Bobby and Julie Gregory, told Guinness they decided to reach out to the record-keeping company after seeing TobyKeith’s story all over the news. “Bobby was sitting on the couch and friends and family started texting and calling about a story they saw about a 21-year-old dog getting the record,” Julie said. Julie said the pocket-sized dog and her husband had an immediate connection when they visited an adoption center, originally searching for a big dog. Although Pebbles didn’t fit their ideal description, they couldn’t pass up the bug-eyed canine. In her spare time, Pebbles likes to play under palm trees in the backyard, go on walks with Bobby and sunbathe by the pool. She also enjoys getting dressed up in different outfits, and a cowboy hat is her favorite accessory. When asked about Pebbles’ secret to longevity, Julie said, “Treat [your pet] like family, because they are. Give them a happy, positive environment as much as possible, good clean food, and proper health care.” Pebbles celebrated her record-breaking achievement with a special meal and bubble bath.
