The Rangers bounced back in a big way in Game 2 of their first-round series against the Penguins, winning 5-2 Thursday night and sending the best-of-seven showdown to Pittsburgh tied at one game apiece. Let’s set the stage for a crucial Game 3 by answering some questions (edited for clarity) submitted by our Texts from the Blue Seats subscribers… What is the status of Barclay Goodrow, Ryan Lindgren, Tyler Motte and Sammy Blais?— Everyone Let’s take these in order… Goodrow (lower-body injury) probably won’t play for the remainder of the Rangers’ first-round series against the Penguins, head coach Gerard Gallant said Friday after practice. I think he may have gotten hurt when he blocked a Mike Matheson shot with either his leg or ankle in Game 1. It’s a tough loss, considering his playoff and Stanley Cup-winning experience, in addition to him being a utility player, penalty killer and someone who drives the Rangers forecheck.
