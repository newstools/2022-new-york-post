A Bronx day care worker was busted on child pornography charges after one of the kids from the center he worked at appeared in lewd footage, authorities said this week. Silfredo A. Castillo Martinez, 32 – who works at Lina’s Garden Day Care – operating out of his home on Decatur Avenue near East Gun Hill Road in Williamsbridge – was busted May 3, cops said Monday. According to the police, he is accused of “possessing multiple pornographic images of sex acts with children.” Police said one of the day care’s charges was a victim – and released Martinez’s mugshot as they investigate whether he had any other young victims. He was charged with promoting a sexual performance by a child, and possessing a sexual performance by a child, authorities said. Martinez was employed by the center from July 2011 until his arrest this month, cops said. The day care search website Winnie indicates the license for Lina’s Garden Day Care “is currently inactive, in renewal, or no longer in use.” State records show the day care had the capacity for 12 children, ages 6 weeks to 12 years, plus four additional school-aged kids.
