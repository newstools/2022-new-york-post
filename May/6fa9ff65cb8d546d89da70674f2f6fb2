FAIRFAX, Va. — Actress Amber Heard struggled with anxiety, insecurity and substance abuse — and was jealous of Johnny Depp’s fame, her former nurse testified at the couple’s defamation trial on Tuesday. Private nurse Erin Falati also said that Heard, 36, told her that she had a history of bipolar disorder, ADHD, co-dependency and insomnia during her tumultuous marriage with Depp. “I have a generalized memory of there being … jealous and anxiety issues, including mistrust within the relationship,” Falati testified. “I have a vague sense of those issues popping up throughout the years, but I wouldn’t say that was a constant theme.” Falati testified in a pre-recorded video deposition at the trial stemming from Depp’s $50 million lawsuit claiming Heard’s abuse allegations against him damaged his career, with the trial now in its 13th day. Falati, who also uses the name Erin Boerum, was a private nurse hired to evaluate Heard starting in 2014 — describing the actress as “agitated” and “screaming” in her notes. The nurse’s notes also cite a history of substance abuse, “including an addiction to cocaine and liquor,” and said Heard “reports she drinks 1-3 glasses of red wine a day. “[Heard] reports [a] familial history of substance abuse,” the notes said. “Both mother and father have abused and become dependent on stimulants (methamphetamine) opiates and alcohol.” In one instance, Falati writes that Heard “reports [a] history of substance abuse including addiction to cocaine and liquor.” Heard also told the nurse that she felt jealous of Depp and felt he did not support her. Depp, 58, is suing Heard for $50 million, alleging her claims that he was abusive seriously damaged his career, costing him in excess of $40 million in earnings. Heard’s lawyers say the actor’s own demons, not Heard’s allegations, cost him his role in the Disney movie franchise “Pirates of the Caribbean” and other jobs.
