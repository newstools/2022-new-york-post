EGOT-winning actress Rita Moreno is bringing some grandmotherly love to the upcoming “Fast & Furious” sequel “Fast X.” Vin Diesel, 54, announced the news Tuesday in an Instagram video, sitting between 90-year-old Moreno and co-star Michelle Rodriguez, 43. “It’s been my dream forever to work with Rita Moreno, and the fact that she’s here playing my grandmother makes my soul smile,” Diesel said of the “West Side Story” legend, who will play the grandma of Diesel’s character, Dominic Toretto. “I’m so blessed.” Moreno gladly accepted the role. “You know what? I think I was getting … I think my old age was waiting for you to invite me. Isn’t that nice? And I’m here. And the answer is yes, I’ll do it,” she said about the part. The casting addition comes weeks after the previous “Fast” director, Justin Lim, left the project. Louis Leterrier will now direct the 10th installment, which will reportedly premiere on May 19, 2023. Diesel previously welcomed Brie Larson to the movie in April.
