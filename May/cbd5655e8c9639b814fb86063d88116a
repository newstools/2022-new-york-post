Ciara is still getting used to her new surroundings. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover star, 36, appeared on “The Late Late Show with James Corden” on Monday, when she was asked about moving to Denver after husband Russell Wilson’s trade to the Broncos, and how she’s adjusting to the altitude. “Oh my goodness, you feel it,” Ciara began. “My last rehearsal was crazy. I was like, I need a break. We had a couple breaks in the schedule, like just take a moment and pause, and breathe, you can really feel it. Going upstairs, it’s like I literally worked out for one hour.” Ciara and Wilson, who have been married since 2016, headed to Denver after the 33-year-old quarterback was traded by the Seattle Seahawks in March. And while the change of scenery has taken some getting used to, the “Level Up” singer did note a few competitive advantages. “Training there for a good bit, then you’re going to be ready for the opponents, you’re going to be ready when it’s time to hit the stage, I had extra wind and I was like, ‘Let’s go!'” Wilson and Ciara have long been each other’s biggest cheerleaders, with the nine-time Pro Bowler supporting the mother of three’s most recent performances and career milestones, including her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover. “You are not only the most beautiful woman in the world, but your heart, your kindness, your love for others, your ability to make the world dance, your a big time CEO, an incredible wife and mother! You Inspire me!There is nothing you can’t do! Worth more than Gold! I love you baby! Congrats Cover Girl!” Wilson gushed Monday on Instagram. In addition to Ciara, Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk, and Yumi Nu also appear on Sports Illustrated Swimsuit covers this year.
