Eva Mendes could return to acting but has very specific guidelines on what kinds of roles she would accept. The 48-year-old actress appeared on “The View” on Tuesday and talked about what it would take to break her nearly 8-year hiatus from TV shows and movies. “I have such a short list of what I will do,” she said. “Before kids, I mean, if it was a fun project — but now I won’t do violence, I don’t want to do sexuality; the list is short.” Mendes’ last acting role came in 2014 in “The Lost River,” which was written and directed by her husband, Ryan Gosling, 41. When asked if Mendes would consider taking on a project that met her criteria, she said, “I hope so. It has to be nice and clean.” “Stuff like Disney does,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg suggested. “Disney! Perfect,” Mendes responded. Mendes has been keeping busy as a co-owner and brand ambassador for Skura Style, a “smart sponge” that tells you when it’s time to replace the kitchen scrubby.
