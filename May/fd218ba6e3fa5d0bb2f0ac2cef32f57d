Publicly funded CUNY Law School has chosen a flagrant anti-Semite for this year’s commencement speaker. Nerdeen Mohsen Kiswani is the founder and a leader of Within Our Lifetime, an outfit dedicated to the complete eradication of Israel. The group’s been banned from Instagram for hate speech; StopAntisemitism.org named Kiswani its anti-Semite of the year for 2020. At WOL’s violent protests, the hate-monitor Canary Mission reports, “activists physically attack Jews and passersby. The group targets Jewish groups, businesses and individual philanthropists who support the state of Israel.” Kiswani is typically front and center at WOL rallies, leading such chants as “There is only one solution, Intifada revolution.” (“Globalize the Intifada” is WOL’s latest campaign). At a protest last July, she allegedly told the crowd, “I hope that a pop-pop is the last noise that some Zionists hear in their lifetime.” Anti-Semitic hate crimes are up 24% in New York (the highest in the nation). And CUNY Law is looking to make it worse, at taxpayer expense.
