Rebel Wilson is opening up about an “awful and disgusting” #MeToo moment that involved a male former co-star on a film shoot. The 42-year-old Aussie alleged to People that she was harassed by a castmate, whom she did not identify, on a movie set several years ago — and it shockingly was done in front of a group of his friends. “He called me into a room and pulled down his pants,” she said. The “awful guy” then reportedly proceeded to make an unspecified “gross” request of the “Bridesmaids” actress. “It was awful and disgusting,” she added. “And all the behavior afterwards — this was all before #MeToo — where they kind of tried to destroy me and my career. “If it had happened after #MeToo, then I could have just blasted them,” the “Senior Year” star added, noting that her law degree came in handy. “Because I’m a lawyer, I documented it,” said Wilson, who graduated from the University of New South Wales in 2009. “I called my rep. I got certain things in writing about what happened.” She said she also “made sure people knew what happened” to her. “I should have left. It wasn’t worth it,” she said of her experience on the set. “But at the same time, I was like, ‘Oh well, do the right thing, be a professional and finish the movie.’ Now I would never do that.” She recalled reporting the incident to higher-ups, though she was hesitant to do so. “I thought even complaining to my agency was a big step. And to complain to the studio,” Wilson said. “I found out I was like the fourth person to complain about the guy. Such gross behavior, but a lot of women have had it way worse.” Since then, however, she realized she could take things a step further. “If it happened again, I would probably stand up for myself even more just because of the bravery of the other women that have stood up and now allowed me an opportunity,” Wilson explained.
