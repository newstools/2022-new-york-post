The suspect who fatally shot an innocent straphanger on a Manhattan train handed off the gun to a homeless man — who then sold the murder weapon to a third person, police sources said. Shortly after the unidentified gunman blasted 48-year-old David Enriquez in the chest Sunday — without provocation — he fled the train at Canal Street and went up the stairs, where he randomly handed the gun to a 46-year-old vagrant, the sources said. Investigators found surveillance footage showing the suspect giving the gun to the man, the sources said. That man was taken into custody and charged with criminal possession of a loaded firearm, the sources said. Further investigation revealed that the homeless man held onto the gun for about eight hours before selling it to a third man for $10 and a bag of cocaine, according to the sources. The man who bought the gun approached a detective on scene and said he had the weapon, but he was not arrested, according to the sources. He “made it clear” that neither he nor the seller were responsible for the shooting, the sources said. The relationship between the two men, if any, is not known. Enriquez, who lived in Park Slope and had worked for Goldman Sachs for nine years as an investment researcher, was on his way to brunch when he was killed, his sister, Griselda Vile, said Sunday. “I wish you guys would go back to Mayor [Eric] Adams and tell him the city is not safe,” she added. “My brother just became a statistic on the way to the city. He was shot at close range.” In an early Monday tweet, Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell identified the suspect in the slaying as a man shown in surveillance images wearing a dark jacket, white mask and light-colored pants. “We need all eyes on this,” Sewell wrote. “@NYPDDetectives need your help identifying & locating this man who is wanted for homicide in the tragic, senseless shooting of a man on a ‘Q’ train that was approaching the Canal/Centre St. station on Sunday.”
