The Yankees are going to have sit on one of their rare losses just a little longer. The Yankees-White Sox game was postponed by rain Friday night and will be made up Sunday as part of a single-admission doubleheader set for 3:05 p.m., with the nightcap beginning no earlier than 7:05 p.m. So, the Yankees’ walk-off loss Thursday in Baltimore — only their second defeat in the last 11 games — will stew until the delayed homestand opener Saturday. Tickets for Friday will not be valid for Sunday. Paid tickets for the game Friday may be exchanged for tickets to a similar regular-season home game subject to availability. The Andy Pettitte bobblehead giveaway for the first 18,000 fans has been rescheduled for Friday, June 10. That game is eligible for the ticket exchange under the team’s rain check policy. Nestor Cortes will pitch Saturday against the White Sox and the plan for the doubleheader remains up in the air. The Yankees will need a sixth starter this week. Boone said there are a number of candidates, including minor league pitcher JP Sears, who appeared in two games as a reliever for the Yankees in April. He has been building up his pitch count in the minors. The first game of Sunday’s doubleheader will be broadcast by Prime Video — as Friday’s game would have — and the second will air on ESPN.
