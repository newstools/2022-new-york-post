Things are looking upside-down for the spoiler-conscious “Stranger Things” creators, the Duffer brothers. A Monopoly tie-in boardgame has spilled the beans on key plot points of the upcoming season, which made the Duffer brothers have a “total meltdown,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. Customers who purchased the game took photos and posted them online last month, where they made the rounds on Reddit. The poster alleged that the game was purchased from Target and was likely put out early as a mistake since it can’t be purchased online yet. “If it was placed on the floor ahead of schedule….it was probably the fault of an employee improperly processing shipment,” they wrote. “…The Monopoly game is not a true leak, but rather a mistake on someone’s part.” The Duffer brothers were not consulted about the game, which isn’t unusual for toy tie-ins to TV shows. The Baby Yoda toy was not available long after “The Mandalorian” launched because showrunner Jon Favreau had similar spoiler concerns. Still, this continues a bad week of press for Netflix, after it laid off 150 workers following earlier reports of plummeting stocks and bleeding subscribers. Season 4 of “Stranger Things” begins after the death of Billy (Dacre Montgomery), and with the gang split up. Hopper (David Harbour) is being held in a sinister camp in remote Russia while everyone thinks he’s dead. Meanwhile, the Byers family, which includes Joyce (Winona Ryder), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Wil (Noah Schnapp) have moved away from Hawkins, Indiana. On top of all of that, as shown in the trailer, war is brewing. “Stranger Things” will end with Season 5. Season 4 will premiere in two parts, on May 27 and on July 1. Reps from “Stranger Things” and Netflix did not reply when The Post reached out for comment.
