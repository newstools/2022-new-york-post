Michigan police are searching for an “armed and dangerous” woman who is accused of killing her boyfriend and her brother on Sunday morning. The Oakland County Sheriff’s Office has warned the public not to approach 22-year-old Ruby Taverner — a petite double homicide suspect, MILive reported. Deputies responded to a report of gunshots at an apartment complex in Clarkston around 3:20 a.m. Sunday, cops said. At the scene, police discovered the bodies of Ruby Taverner’s boyfriend, 26-year-old Ray Muscat of Independence Township, and her brother, 25-year-old Bishop Taverner of Oxford. Both had been fatally shot. Bishop Taverner was found in the living room with a single gunshot wound, police said. Muscat’s body was found in a rear bedroom. Police said Ruby Taverner and Ray Muscat — formerly known as Amber Muscat — had lived together, but it was unclear how long they had been in a relationship. Ruby Taverner’s cellphone and vehicle were found at the scene. Cops said they believe she fled on foot. Police described her as a thin, white woman with purple hair. She stands at 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 115 pounds. She has three registered handguns in her name — including one that was purchased within the past week, cops said. Police are still investigating the circumstances that led to the shooting. “Our Fugitive Apprehension Team, other Detectives and assets are actively looking for this homicide suspect who we believe is armed and dangerous,” Oakland Sheriff Michael Bouchard said in a statement, MILive reported. “Please contact 911 if you see her or know of her whereabouts.”
