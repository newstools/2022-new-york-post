What was supposed to be a dazzling matchup that might symbolically determine the NBA’s future instead has harkened back to the NBA’s past.

Which superpower would emerge as a possible championship team in what was accurately hyped as the league’s most intriguing second-round matchup? What has emerged, through three games, is a series whose biggest moments evoke the 1990s — when bodies were flying, tempers were raging and the game was more about force than beauty.
