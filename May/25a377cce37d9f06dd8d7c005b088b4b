The final score for Sunday’s Game 3 between the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes may have looked in line with what we saw from the first two games in Raleigh, but anybody watching would tell you that is not the case. Through the first two games of the series, both teams seemed OK with focusing on playing well-structured defense and keeping the game predictable. That pragmatic style of hockey culminated in Game 2, when the two teams combined for 10 high-danger scoring chances between them at five-on-five. On Sunday, that total ballooned to 25 and if it weren’t for superb goaltending, especially from the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin, this game could have sailed over the total with plenty of time to spare. Savvy bettors know that the final box score is often misleading and even though the Under hasn’t been in jeopardy in any of the first three games, Sunday’s 3-1 Rangers victory could have easily featured more scoring. And with all three games going Under the total so far, bookmakers are forced to adjust the total, knowing that plenty of Under money will show up ahead of puck drop. It’s also worth noting that there were plenty of extracurricular activities after Game 3 and both camps seem to be pretty heated. If that emotion spills into Tuesday night, we could see more power plays, which is always a good thing when backing the Over. Best bet: Rangers-Hurricanes Over 5.5 goals (+120) — FanDuel
