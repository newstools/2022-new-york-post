A sicko straphanger is wanted for sexually abusing a 36-year-old woman aboard a 3 train in Manhattan in April, police said. The unknown suspect approached the unsuspecting woman on a moving southbound 3 train on April 29 shortly after 1 p.m., cops said. The twisted train passenger kissed his victim near her mouth and ear and then touched her inner thigh, grabbed her breast and genital area over her clothing, police said. The wanted individual stepped off the train at the Park Place station following the unprovoked attack, authorities said. The shaken victim was not injured in the sexual abuse incident. The NYPD on Friday released a photo of the unidentified suspect and is hoping anyone with information will come forward. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
