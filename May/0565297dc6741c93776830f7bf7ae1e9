Jay Taikeff from Brooklyn writes, “You’re an entertaining handicapper. I think management is encouraging you to pick local games as that is good for business. Since you got off to a hot start, perfect at Citi Field picking the Mets, a continuation could result in you throwing out the first ball at Citi Field for the playoffs. It gives you a full year to choose the Stitches walk-on music.” Got it down to three. “Bad Luck,” “Dazed and Confused” and “I’m a Loser.” So we’re heading back to Citi Field, Jay. The Mariners’ George Kirby, a Rye, N.Y., native, will make his second career start because his first one was surprisingly effective. He four-hit the Rays over six scoreless on Sunday. Chris Bassitt (4-2, 2.45 ERA) has given the Mets a rotation upgrade. Bassitt’s last start was a gem as he limited the Phillies to a run over 5 ²/₃ on Sunday. Play 10 units on the Mets. “The Beat Goes On” may also be a tune that fits. Rays 5, Jays 2. Kevin Gausman made 98 pitches, the last eight killed us. Loss has us at +53 zeppelins.
