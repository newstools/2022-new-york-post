Patrick Mahomes and wife Brittany Matthews are adding another teammate to their family. The longtime couple announced Sunday that they’re expecting their second child together, two months after tying the knot. In a photo post shared on Instagram, Mahomes is seen sitting beside Matthews and their 1-year-old daughter, Sterling Skye, who holds a sign that reads, “Big sister duties coming soon.” A separate image features Matthews, a Kansas City Current soccer club co-owner, holding up a sonogram as the Chiefs quarterback, 26, smiles beside her. Together since their high-school days, Mahomes and Matthews made their decades-long love official in March when they wed in a lavish Hawaiian ceremony. The pair then jetted off for a dreamy honeymoon in St. Barts. Matthews, who boasts over one million Instagram followers, shared photos from her and Mahomes’ tropical getaway, calling their honeymoon “perfect.” Since returning stateside, the past few weeks have been busy for Matthews and Mahomes, with the duo checking out Coachella and NBA playoff games in April. Mahomes and Matthews initially announced their engagement in September 2020. Weeks later, the couple confirmed that they were expecting, with Matthews giving birth to daughter Sterling in February 2021. Though Matthews and Mahomes are preparing for their new addition, the Super Bowl-winning quarterback is also gearing for Wednesday’s highly-anticipated golf event, “The Match,” in which he and Bills quarterback Josh Allen will face Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.
