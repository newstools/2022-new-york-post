Beauty comes with age, right? Social media user Annamaria Kalebic posted a video revealing how she feels she is much most attractive in her 50s compared to her at 40. “I lost my groove in my 40s, but thankfully I found it again in my 50s,” said Kalebic. In the photos she shared of her at 50, her skin is glowing and looks much smoother compared to the selfies of her at 40. Her face is now also much thinner and her hair is fuller. “Good nutrition, strength training, and taking good care of myself are just some of the changes I’ve made which have given me my confidence back,” she said. “I feel healthier and more beautiful than ever.” On her Instagram, she shares her healthy glow-up tips with her followers, crediting healthy eating, workouts, and prioritizing her gut health as her age rewind secrets. “I count plants not calories,” she said. “It’s the reason why I feel fitter now in my 50s than I did in my 20s.” Though she credits her healthy lifestyle to her stunning glow-up, many viewers claim she’s faking it. “Makeup and good lighting,” said one user. “A filter by the look of it,” another said. “Filters and Fillers!” “We don’t grow younger,” said another.
