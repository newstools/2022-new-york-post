It’s going for B.I.G. bucks now. The limited-edition MetroCards released to commemorate Notorious B.I.G.’s 50th birthday are now being re-sold on eBay for nearly $5,000. Last weekend, fans of the late Brooklyn rapper stood in line for hours to get their hands on some of the 50,000 MetroCards released to the public. By Wednesday, several appeared on eBay with one intrepid seller auctioning one off for almost $5,000, according to Curbed. Christopher George Latore Wallace, also known as Notorious B.I.G., was widely considered the greatest rapper of all time until he was killed by four gunshot wounds on March 9, 1997, during a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. According to Twitter, fans lined up for hours in the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center subway station and and several other Brooklyn locations just to get their hands on the card. Fans who still want to get their hands on the limited-edition card can find several of them on eBay starting at an attainable $55 for a scratched card and a laminated option starting at $75. In order to get the card, MTA officials required that potential buyers purchase a minimum of two fares, which several sellers used to their advantage when advertising. The card currently going for $4,899 has been billed as a “brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item” and will have expedited shipping, according to the eBay seller. This is not the first time the Big Apple has released limited-edition cards. In April 2018, the MTA released 250,000 limited-edition David Bowie cards that featured five different photos from all different eras of the late glam-rock icon’s life. The streetwear brand Supreme also released its own MetroCard in 2017 that had people waiting in line at the SoHo store for over an hour just so they could get their hands on one.
