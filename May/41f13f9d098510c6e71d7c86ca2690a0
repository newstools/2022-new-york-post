Listings in London’s Meadway Estate — on the city’s most coveted corners, with just 34 homes — are rare. But currently there are not one, but two on the market at the same time. “This estate on the English Monopoly board would be Park Lane,” said Matt Turner, director of real estate agency Rash & Rash, which currently represents two Meadway Estate listings. “You literally feel like you’re in the Cotswolds,” he said of England’s popular rural area famed for its stone architecture, “but obviously you’re in the suburbs of London.” The first of the listings is a move-in-ready, semi-detached four-bedroom built in 1926 and set to hit the market Wednesday for $1.72 million. The address has one original fireplace and the potential for a rear extension. The current owners bought the home during the 2008 financial crisis and are selling now that their children are grown, Turner noted. The other listing, while on a significantly smaller lot with a more modest footprint is, uniquely, a time capsule in its own right — selling for the first time since it was built in 1926. “My client, the great grandson of the original buyer, he’s just been holding onto it, he didn’t want to sell it,” said Turner, noting the situation is “very, very rare” and houses from the home’s era have usually had a minimum of three owners. “It’s a very emotional sale for him.” The three-bedroom, one-bathroom home, which is asking for $1.23 million, is in need of some work — a small price for the right buyer, who will appreciate its barely touched charm and plentiful period details. Built in the Tudorbethan style, the home has a high pitched, gabled roof with timber elements and an abundance of millwork throughout. A side garage is in such a deteriorated state that it’s “pretty much falling down” and has been off limits on the many showings Turner has done of the house since it listed, he told Mansion Global. “We haven’t let anyone go in there.”
