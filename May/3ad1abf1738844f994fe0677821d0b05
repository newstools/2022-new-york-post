Are you smizing? A Chelsea loft once owned by Jay Manuel — the former “America’s Next Top Model“ creative director and author of the novel “The Wig, the Bitch & the Meltdown” — has hit the market for $3.25 million. Past residents in the same Chelsea Mercantile building (at 252 Seventh Ave.) include chef Bobby Flay, actress Katie Holmes and singer Lance Bass. Manuel and his partner, Alton Johnson, sold the fifth-floor home in 2011 for $2.55 million to its current owners. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit is a sprawling 2,268 square feet and features 11-foot-high beamed ceilings, hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, a foyer and an eat-in chef’s kitchen. The main bedroom boasts a large closet and ensuite bath. Fittingly, the building — which dates to 1907 — once housed the National Cloak and Suit Company, a service that produced and shipped made-to-order garments. Its current (fierce) amenities include a gym, a children’s playroom, bike storage, a rooftop deck — and a “secret” back entrance. The listing broker is Serhant’s Chloe Tucker Caine.
