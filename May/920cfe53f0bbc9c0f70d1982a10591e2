A Tennessee woman is back behind bars after allegedly firing a gun into a crowd and striking a 12-year-old boy a day after she was released on bond on separate charges. Latroya Lemons, 35, was arrested on Tuesday after she allegedly opened fire from a vehicle at a Memphis home where the child had been playing last Wednesday, hitting him in the leg, Fox 13 reported. Memphis police had taken Lemons into custody earlier in the week for harassment charges after she allegedly threatened to kill her ex-boyfriend. She was locked up and released on bond on those charges the day before the 12-year-old was shot, records show. Police said she pulled up on the home to find her ex-boyfriend and opened fire. Witnesses identified Lemons as the shooter who fired five shots from a gray Cadillac, according to Fox 13. She faces numerous new charges, including six counts of aggravated assault, six counts of reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon and four counts of violating bail conditions. Her bond has been set at $500,000, the outlet reported.
