The NYPD is expected to blow past its overtime budget by nearly $150 million — after already almost burning through its allotted funds earlier this year, a new projection shows. The figures from the city’s Independent Budget Office come as Mayor Eric Adams directs police brass to flood the streets and subways with officers and supervisors to try to stem the surge of violence in the Big Apple. The NYPD used $564.2 million of its allocated funds for overtime as of March 31, according to the IBO, which estimates the department will spend a total of $750 million in extra shift pay by the end of the fiscal year. That’s roughly $143 million over its $607.3 million budget — and, compared to the last six years, only second to 2020, when police overtime skyrocketed during the protests following George Floyd’s police death at $837.5 million. The new estimates are for all of the department’s overtime, including civilian employees and uniformed cops, the latter of whom account for about 80% of the added cost, according to the IBO. Police sources have told The Post over the last few weeks that paychecks were soaring with the added shifts, but the IBO has given the first glimpse this year of the NYPD’s overtime. The country’s largest police force has historically overshot its budget even after the cuts due to the pandemic and anti-police movement following Floyd’s death. “We are focused on ensuring the Department uses overtime, which is a critical and essential tool, particularly now given the nearly 1200 cut to our uniformed headcount, in the most effective and efficient ways,” a police spokesperson said.
