The Mets didn’t have a regular starting pitcher to throw on Monday, but now they don’t have a game. The series opener between the Mets and Cardinals has been postponed due to impending storms. It will be made up on Tuesday as part of a single-admission doubleheader, beginning at 3:10 p.m. Long man Trevor Williams had been set to make a spot start Monday night, which was supposed to be Tylor Megill’s day in the rotation before he landed on the injured list Sunday with right biceps tendinitis. The Mets will still need a starter for one of the games in Tuesday’s doubleheader – Taijuan Walker would be on turn to start the other game – but they can add an arm by calling up another pitcher to be the 27th man.
