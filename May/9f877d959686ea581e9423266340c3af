Comedian Whitney Cummings knows she has some haters. “It took me a long time to learn that I’m an inherently triggering person,” she told The Post at the Fox Upfront in New York. “I’m the woman who’s running my mouth.” The “Whitney” star, 39, revealed how she deals with men on her Instagram account posting “You’re not funny.” “You don’t have to like me but you watch my stuff so you’re already a radical feminist,” she explained. “You watched a woman talk for an hour and then you came to my account. You love me, you love me.” She also noted that “a lot of people get off on anger and self-righteous indignation.” So when someone comes spouting vitriol, Cummings tries to be the bigger person. “Like, maybe that’s what you needed today to feel better,” she explained. “To put me down and like, write it. I’m glad I can be of service. Like, it’s not the way I intended to make your day, but like, a lot of people need that. “I mean like I’m into all the programs and stuff and I’m very much like, ‘Oh, people hurt people and that’s just pain.'” The performer will be seen in the upcoming Fox crime anthology “Accused” in which she plays a comedian. “It’s interesting because there are a lot of TV shows where they have female comedians and they’re not played by comedians,” she noted. “So I was like, ‘Oh, there’s no way they’ll actually give this to a comedian.'” Cummings credits writer Howard Gordon with giving her the role. “I think they wanted someone who had a little bit of an unpredictable energy and a polarizing person, maybe. I mean actual female comedians are some of the most hated people on the planet,” she said with a laugh. “I mean, it’s you either love us or hate us kind of thing.”
