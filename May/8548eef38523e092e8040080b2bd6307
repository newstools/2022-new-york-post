Your next salad could help you build the perfect mini greenhouse to get seedlings started. The plastic clamshell container is the perfect size to get a group of seedlings budding before they’re ready to join your garden. When you finish your meal, clean out the container and poke some holes in the top to allow for ventilation. Add the potting mix of your choice to the bottom half. It’s best to follow the directions on the seed packet for spacing and how deep to plant your seeds, according to the Family Handyman. Add some water and close the lid then place the container in a sunny spot. The plastic will trap heat while making sure the soil stays moist. Another simple and low-cost hack for your garden involves diapers. Disposable diapers have hydrogel in them to make sure they absorb and retain liquids. This is the same stuff that’s sold in garden stores but usually advertised as water retention crystals, reports Gardening Know How. Pick up the cheapest box of diapers you can find at your local big-box store. Tear open the diaper and pour the contents into a mixing bowl. Don’t pick out the little pieces of cotton, as they also help absorb water. Add water to the mixture until you have a gel consistency, then add equal parts of potting soil. You can now use this mixture in pots for your new plants. If you’d rather not get your hands dirty, you can just peel away the part of the diaper that goes against the baby’s bottom and place it in the bottom of the pot.
