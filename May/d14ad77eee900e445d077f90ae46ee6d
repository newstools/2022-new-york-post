An MTA bus fatally struck a man in Staten Island early Friday and drove off, officials said. The man, believed to be in his 50s, was found just before 4:30 a.m. unconscious at the intersection of Forest Hill Road and Platinum Avenue, a block away from the MTA Yukon Bus Depot, cops said. The man, whose injuries appeared to be from a vehicle strike, died at the scene, according to police. A police spokeswoman said the vehicle did not stop and officials could not confirm an MTA bus was involved. A transit agency source later told The Post that the vehicle was an MTA bus. A spokesman for the MTA confirmed that a bus on the SIM10 line had struck a person at the same location and time but did not answer questions about it leaving the scene.
