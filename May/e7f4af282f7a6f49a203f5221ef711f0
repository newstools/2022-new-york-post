The Rangers played a game they could have won on Wednesday, and everything they’ve said about the 2-1 overtime loss to the Hurricanes in Game 1 of this second-round series has reflected that fact. They controlled play for 40 minutes, and it looked like that would be enough to escape PNC Arena with a 1-0 lead in the series until Sebastian Aho finally got one past Igor Shesterkin with 2:23 to go. Despite the unpleasant reality of the loss, coupled with the Hurricanes finding a groove in the final period of regulation, the tone emanating from coach Gerard Gallant and his players has been positive. Gallant pointed out to reporters on Thursday that Carolina had dominated the last two matchups between these teams in their building, and was right in saying that this one felt different. Reality, though, has a way of kicking you in the teeth. And the Rangers still woke up on Thursday needing to overcome a deficit to keep their season alive, just days after having successfully done just that against the Penguins.
