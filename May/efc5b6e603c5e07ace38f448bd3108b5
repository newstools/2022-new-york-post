There is a new fashion statement being made at One Jets Drive. Jets players, coaches and staff members have been wearing T-shirts this spring with the phrase “Positive Vibes Only” on them. The shirts are a statement not just about fashion, of course, but about the organization’s mentality as the 2022 season draws closer. There is an air of optimism around the Jets that has not existed in some time. You have to go back to 2015 for an offseason that created this much excitement. That year, new general manager Mike Maccagnan went on a free-agency spending spree, highlighted by the return of Darrelle Revis. That worked in the short term as the Jets went 10-6; a bad day in Buffalo kept them out of the playoffs.
