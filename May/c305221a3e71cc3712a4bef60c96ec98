A 33-year-old man was brutally stabbed outside a Bronx firehouse last week, authorities said. The victim was on Sedgwick Avenue near West Burnside Avenue, outside FDNY Engine 43/Ladder 59, in Morris Heights around 12:10 a.m. on May 23 when a man stabbed him three times, cops said late Monday. A surveillance image released by the NYPD shows the attacker approaching the victim with a threatening stance and raising a knife. The victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was listed in critical but stable condition. The circumstances leading up to the attack were unclear Tuesday. No one from the firehouse was involved in the incident, cops said. The suspect is shown on surveillance footage leaving the scene with at least one man, two women and a child. A group of others are seen standing on the sidewalk. Police are still looking for the suspect, who they describe as about 25-years-old with multiple tattoos on his arms and right hand. He was last wearing a white T-shirt, dark green camouflage pants and reflective sneakers.
