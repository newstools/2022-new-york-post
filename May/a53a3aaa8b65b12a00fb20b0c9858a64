Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor delivered an epic performance in Cleveland’s 12-9 win over the Chicago White Sox on Monday, which he capped off with an equally memorable victory lap after hitting his second home run of the night. Naylor first hit a grand slam in the top of the ninth, evening the score to 8-8. Two innings later, the 24-year-old crushed a three-run homer and completely lost it after making it back to home plate. In a video that has since made its way around the internet, an ecstatic Naylor is seen celebrating with teammates before tossing his helmet into the dugout and appearing to drop a few expletives along the way. Naylor swung his way into the history books on Monday, according to ESPN, after he became the first player to have eight RBIs from the eighth inning onward in a game since the stat itself became official in 1920. He also had an RBI double in the eighth inning. So far this season, Naylor has logged four home runs and 21 RBIs. He was sidelined for much of last season due to an ankle injury. Naylor was traded to Cleveland by the San Diego Padres in 2020.
