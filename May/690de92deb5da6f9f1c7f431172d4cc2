The Yankees returned home to a washout. The club’s series opener against the Rangers on Friday in The Bronx was postponed by rain. The game is scheduled to be made up as part of a single-admission doubleheader on Sunday, with the first game beginning at 1:35 p.m. The second game will start about 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first. The first game will be broadcast by Amazon Prime Video — which was supposed to air Friday’s game — with the second game on YES Network. Tickets for Friday’s game will not be valid for Sunday’s doubleheader. They may be exchanged for tickets to a similar regular-season game at Yankee Stadium, subject to availability. Gerrit Cole was set to get the ball Friday night for the Yankees, who have won 11 of their past 12 games. The forecast Saturday also calls for rain, though both the Yankees and Rangers have Monday off if it is needed for another makeup. The Yankees likely would prefer to avoid that because it would force them to play on 22 straight days, but this is Texas’ only trip to The Bronx this season. Cole will now start Saturday, assuming that game does not also get rained out. Luis Severino and Jordan Montgomery would then be available to start the doubleheader Sunday, though the Yankees could also opt to move things around with the off days giving them some flexibility. The Yankees won’t see former teammate Albert Abreu on the mound this weekend. The right-handed reliever, who was traded to the Rangers, along with minor league pitcher Robert Ahlstrom, for catcher Jose Trevino at the end of spring training, went on the 15-day injured list Tuesday with a left ankle sprain. For fans who had been hoping to attend the game Friday to get their hands on a Yoda bobblehead, that promotion item has been rescheduled for May 25.
