An 11-year-old girl was fighting for her life Monday after being caught in the crossfire of a shooting on a Bronx corner, police said. The shooting happened at Westchester Avenue and Fox Street in Foxhurst just before 5 p.m. when two men drove by on a moped and opened fire, cops said. Their target was a group of men also standing on the corner but instead hit the 11-year-old in the stomach, according to police. The girl was rushed to Lincoln Hospital where she was in critical condition, cops said.
