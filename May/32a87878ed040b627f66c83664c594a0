Detroit wasted no time making Aidan Hutchinson a Lion in last week’s NFL Draft. In a video shared Thursday by Hutchinson’s mom, Melissa, the former Michigan defensive end is seen in the green room with loved ones while speaking to Lions brass as commissioner Roger Goodell is heard in the background announcing the Jaguars’ first-overall selection, Georgia defensive end Travon Walker. “They weren’t lying when they said Detroit wasted no time,” Melissa captioned the video. “PS do u know how HARD it was to stay silent?!! I felt like I was in A Quiet Place!” Hutchinson, who became the second overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, will stay in Michigan, where he’ll help bolster the Lions’ defense. Although there was no question that Hutchinson would be off the board early, the Lions submitted their selection within a minute of the Jaguars grabbing Walker, according to Peter King of NBC Sports. “We turned the card in so fast the league got mad at us,” a Lions official said. Leading up to the draft, Hutchinson and his family had been enjoying their time in Las Vegas, where mom Melissa and his sisters, Aria and Mia, posted photos and videos of their outings on social media. Once Hutchinson had officially been selected by the Lions last Thursday, Mia celebrated with a touching tribute to her sibling. “To watch my brother’s wildest dreams unfold before his eyes is nothing short of miraculous. His grit, tenacity, and sacrifices are only part of why I admire him. He is someone who’s stayed on his path, never comparing himself to others. He is unafraid to put his head down and put in real, meaningful work,” she gushed on Instagram. “He is so ready for the next level. Can’t wait to come to every Lions game!!!”
