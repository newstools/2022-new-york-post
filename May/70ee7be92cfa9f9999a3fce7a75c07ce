The touch downs, trades and house flips continue for Kyle Van Noy, the two-time Super Bowl champion linebacker. Van Noy, 31 — a former Patriot player who just signed with the Los Angeles Chargers — and his interior designer wife Marissa have just listed their renovated home in Canton, Mass., located outside Boston, for $2.69 million. The couple have already earned almost $2 million buying and selling three homes since 2015, according to reports. The real estate deals reflect Van Noy’s professional career — from the Detroit Lions to the New England Patriots, then to the Miami Dolphins and back to the Pats. In their new home of LA, the couple own a home in Santa Monica, where Van Noy has trained in the off-season. This time, the home they’re selling at 30 Bullens Way has five bedrooms, five full bathrooms, a powder room and a heated six-car garage. At a roomy 6,510 square feet, the residence, which was built in 2019, sits on 1.79 acres on a quiet cul-de-sac. The property opens to a grand foyer that leads to a home office with coffered ceilings and a custom barn door. There’s also a dining room that connects to a kitchen — while the great room also features high ceilings and a fireplace. Upstairs, the main bedroom comes with a double-sided fireplace, a balcony, walk-in closet and a spa-like bath. In the basement, of course, there’s also a gym. The couple met when Kyle was playing football at Brigham Young University in Utah and Marissa was studying business at Westminster College. The listing broker is Douglas Elliman’s George Sarkis.
