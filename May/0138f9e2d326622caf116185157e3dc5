A woman is suing rapper Travis Scott, claiming she lost her pregnancy when she was trampled at his disastrous Astroworld concert in November, it was revealed on Thursday. Shanazia Williamson and her husband, Jarawd Owens, of Dayton, Ohio were expecting a baby — until she was “crushed” by a stampede of fans at the festival in Houston, Tex., according to a wrongful death lawsuit cited by Rolling Stone magazine. “While in attendance at the festival, Shanazia was trampled and crushed resulting in horrific injuries and ultimately the death of her and Jarawd’s unborn child,” the suit states. “In addition, Shanazia sustained injuries to her shoulder, back, leg, chest, stomach and other parts of her body.” The lawsuit claims the concert’s promoters, Live Nation and ScoreMore, had inadequate security and failed to prevent the massive crowd surge, which killed ten people and injured hundreds. “Defendants’ failure to plan, design, manage, operate, staff, and supervise the event was a direct and proximate cause of Shanazia’s injuries and death of her and Jarawd’s unborn child,” according to the suit, filed in December. The couple claims Scott and the promoters were “negligent” because they failed to set up medical personnel and to recognize the festival’s safety hazards, the outlet reported. The security companies Valle Services SMG, ASM Global, and the Harris County Sports and Convention corporation were also named as defendants in the lawsuit. Organizers of the concert have come under intense scrutiny in recent months and are facing several other lawsuits over their alleged failure to stop the performance while attendees were screaming for help. In total, more than 300 people were injured and 25 were hospitalized. The couple’s attorneys, Jason Itkin and Kurt Arnold, declined to comment on the case, citing a gag order. Reps for Scott and Live Nation didn’t immediately return The Post’s request for comment Thursday.
