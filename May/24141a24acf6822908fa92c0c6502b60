A scary scene unfolded on the diamond Tuesday during the Detroit Tigers’ doubleheader against the Oakland Athletics at Comerica Park. In the fifth inning, A’s shortstop Elvis Andrus and left-fielder Chad Pinder collided in left field while chasing a popup. The two teammates were focused on the ball while running full speed when Pinder’s face appeared to smash into Andrus’ knee. After the crash, Pinder and Andrus remained down on the field for several minutes. An infield umpire appeared to signal Oakland Athletics trainers to tend to the scene. Both players appeared to be fine and Pinder and Andrus both stayed in the game. Unfortunately for the duo, the A’s suffered a 6-0 loss to the Tigers in the first game of the doubleheader. Oakland beat Detroit 2-0 on Monday. The Tigers and A’s close the three-game series later Tuesday evening.
