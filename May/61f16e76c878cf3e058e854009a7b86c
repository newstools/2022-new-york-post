Blonds have more fun – even Kim Kardashian. Glittering in the glitzy, old Hollywood dress once worn by Marilyn Monroe, Kardashian shocked the 2022 Met Gala by donning the historic gown and dyeing her hair platinum blond for the occasion. The 41-year-old cautiously ambled up the Met steps as comedian boyfriend Pete Davidson, dressed in a classic black suit and sunglasses, helped her. She sported platinum blond hair and a white fur coat hiding her infamous rump. Kardashian wore the infamous “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” gown — dubbed the “most expensive” dress — that Monroe wore 60 years ago to serenade then-President John F. Kennedy. “I tried it on and it didn’t fit me,” Kardashian recalled on the red carpet as she retold the tale of her first fitting. “It was such a challenge. It was like a role, I was determined to fit in it.” Kardashian lost 16 pounds in three weeks to squeeze into the gown, even dyeing her hair blond to fit the part — and vowing she’ll keep it that way for a while. Meanwhile, Davidson stood by her side, ducking out of the interview to let his girlfriend shine, despite her beckoning him into the frame. “She wouldn’t let me wear my propellor hat,” he joked to red carpet co-host La La Anthony. “What’s the most American thing you can think of? And that’s Marilyn Monroe,” Kardashian told Vogue. Kardashian, known for showing off her curves much like Monroe, told Vogue she’s donning the “original naked dress.” “Nowadays, everyone wears sheer dresses, but back then that was not the case,” she said. “In a sense, it’s the original naked dress. That’s why it was so shocking.” Kardashian’s mom, Kris Jenner, followed suit, paying homage to Jackie Kennedy, the wife of JFK.
