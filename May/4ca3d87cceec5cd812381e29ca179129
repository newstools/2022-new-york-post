A young tennis fan was left in tears after a player bounced her racket into the stands at the French Open on Thursday, reportedly narrowly missing hitting the child. Irina-Camelia Begu bounced her racket off the clay in frustration during her second-round match against Ekaterina Alexandrova and the racket flew into the crowd. While the child wasn’t hit, according to Open Court, the kid cried after the close call and his parents had to console him. Begu was handed a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct for the incident. The Romanian ultimately defeated the Russian Alexandrova, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4. After the match was over, Begu went over to the child and posed for photos, picking him up in her arms to try to make him happy. In the third round, Begu will face French wild card Leolia Jeanjean, who stunned former world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova on Thursday in a 6-2, 6-2 victory.
