He’s lovin’ it. A man from Wisconsin marked the 50th anniversary of chomping down Big Macs almost every day by landing himself a well-earned spot in the Guinness World Records. Big Mac lover Donald Gorske, 68, who hails from Fond du Lac, Wis., made a routine stop at his local McDonald’s on Tuesday where he celebrated five decades of daily burger-loving fun. It seemed only fitting for Gorske to have a Big Mac in the same McDonald’s he had his first bite of the iconic burger in 1972. “In that moment I said ‘I’m going to probably eat these for the rest of my life,'” he told Guinness World Records. Gorske smashed the record for the most Big Mac burgers eaten in a lifetime in 1999 after wolfing down a whopping 15,490. Guinness last year updated the total to 32,340. In 2004, Gorske was featured in the “Super Size Me” documentary for his burger-eating efforts. In the docu-film, he said he always orders a cup of Coca-Cola with his Big Mac, and rarely eats the fries. To make the moment as special as can be, Gorske’s local McDonald’s displayed a sign outside the restaurant, which read, “Congrats Don on 50 years of Macs.” His portrait is even hung on the wall inside the restaurant he’s been visiting religiously. “I’ll probably be eating Big Macs every day for the rest of my life,” Gorske told the outlet. Throughout his half-a-century-long love affair with Bic Macs, Gorske missed only eight days. To make up for lost time, he sometimes eats two of the burgers a day. “When I like something, I stick with it all the time,” he added. Since then, he’s managed double the record and then some. As proof of his unprecedented achievement, Gorske keeps each individual burger carton and receipt each time he locks lips with the buns. Going a step further, the burger fiend boasts a glass case in which he proudly displays McDonald’s burger cartons from various decades. The Post has reached out to McDonald’s for comment.
