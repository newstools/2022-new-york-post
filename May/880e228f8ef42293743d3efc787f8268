Tom Brady just admitted the starting point of his greatness might have been fraudulent. OK, well not in so many words. But sort of. Brady shared on Twitter a video in response to Justin Bieber’s TikTok request asking for a new trend where people tell him something honest. “The ‘Tuck Rule’ game against the Raiders,” Brady said, before looking to his left and right to make sure no one was around to hear the secret he was about to whisper into the camera, “might have been a fumble.” Gasp! Making his first career playoff start for the Patriots in the 2001 AFC Divisional Round, Brady fumbled late in the fourth quarter and the Raiders recovered to likely seal a victory. But officials reviewed the play and determined that Brady was trying to “tuck” the ball back into his body — an obscure rule at the time that immediately gained fame — and thus overturned the call of a fumble for an incomplete pass. The Patriots kicked the tying field goal, won in overtime and went on to win Super Bowl XXXVI – the first of Brady’s seven championships. If the Patriots had lost that game to the Raiders, maybe Brady returns to the bench the next season behind a healthy Drew Bledsoe and the G.O.A.T.’s career becomes a big what-if. Of course, Raiders fans have been arguing for two decades that the “Tuck Rule” is nonsense and they were robbed of a path to the Super Bowl. The Raiders’ official TikTok account responded “I’m sorry what” to Brady’s video. The NFL’s account replied, “Tom said it, not us” with a crying laughing emoji. Brady originally published his video with the sarcastic note: “Everyone keep this on the down low please.” After it began to go viral that Brady was admitting the blown call, he added in a separate tweet, “I said ‘might.’ Such a tough call. No choice but to respect the officials’ probably correct decision.”
