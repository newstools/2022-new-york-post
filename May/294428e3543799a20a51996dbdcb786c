The Mariners and Astros close out their three-game series on Sunday. Lefty Marco Gonzales (3-4, 3.71) is expected to start for Seattle with Luis Garcia (3-3, 3.38 ERA) getting the call for Houston. Despite a combined record of 6-7, both Gonzales and Garcia have pitched well. Gonzales is coming off his worst outing of the season, in which he allowed eight hits and five runs over 5 ¹/₃ innings against the Athletics. Gonzales has given up two earned runs or fewer, however, in seven of nine starts in 2022. He has faced the Astros twice so far this season and has allowed just four runs in 13 innings of work. Meanwhile, Garcia has been equally impressive, giving up three earned runs or fewer in six of seven starts. This is Garcia’s first start against Seattle this season and that might be good news for the Mariners. Current Seattle hitters are batting .306 versus Garcia and have an on-base percentage of .867. Gonzales should have the edge in this matchup, mainly because the Astros really struggle against left-handed pitchers. Entering Saturday, Houston is batting just .208 and averaging 3.23 runs per game against left-handers this season. Both of those numbers rank near the bottom in MLB. The Astros have struggled in Seattle recently and given their low numbers against lefties, look for that trend to continue on Sunday. Best bet: Mariners, +130 (Caesars Sportsbook)
