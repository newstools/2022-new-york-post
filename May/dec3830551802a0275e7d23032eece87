Chicago fans battled in the bleachers at Wrigley Field on Tuesday during the Cubs’ 3-1 loss to the White Sox. The mayhem was captured by nearby fans, with video showing one Cubs fan pinning another to the bleachers, while another fan appeared to kick a man in the brawl. Although both fans sported Cubs gear, maybe they were unaware they were supporting the same team. Both fans appeared to exchange words in the standoff, though it’s unclear what was said. Security eventually arrived but appeared to struggle in separating the two. [GRAPHIC LANGUAGE] Meanwhile, a separate fight broke out nearby, and fans began screaming and filming the chaos. “He’s my ride home,” one fan yelled in social media footage, referring to one of the fans involved in the altercation. Another fan replied, “I don’t think you’re getting a ride home from him buddy.” It’s unclear if anyone was injured in the scuffle, or if any arrests were made. Either way, Cubs fans took an “L” on Tuesday night when they fell to the White Sox in their first of two meetings this week. The Cubs and White Sox face off again Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
