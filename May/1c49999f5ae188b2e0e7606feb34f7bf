This one is going to sting a bit, Giants fans. The Eagles have agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with former Giants cornerback James Bradberry, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday. Bradberry was released by the Giants this month after the team failed to find a trade partner leading up to April’s 2022 NFL Draft. Though new general manager Joe Schoen had sung Bradberry’s praises, the Pro Bowler carried a $21.9 million salary-cap charge for 2022. A second-round draft pick in 2016, Bradberry began his NFL career with the Panthers before joining the Giants in 2020 on a three-year, $45 million deal.
