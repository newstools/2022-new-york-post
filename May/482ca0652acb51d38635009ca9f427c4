Two games fill out the Tuesday NBA card and Munaf Manji of The Action Network has a favorite player prop bet for each (video above). His first best bet comes in the Eastern Conference matchup between the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics. In that contest, Manji is backing Celtics swingman Jaylen Brown over 2.5 three-pointers made -140 on BetMGM.  “Jaylen Brown has knocked down at least three three-pointers in seven of his last nine games against the Milwaukee Bucks,” Manji explains. Plus, the Celtics as a team put up 50 three-point attempts in the opening contest. Manji expects that trend will continue as the Celtics seek to avoid Milwaukee’s strong interior presence. Lastly, the Bucks have shown concerning defensive metrics from beyond the arc. In the regular season, the Bucks ranked dead-last in three-point defense, allowing opponents the most three-point makes and the most three-point attempts. For Manji’s second player prop, he’s taking Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant over 16.5 rebounds + assists on DraftKings against the Golden State Warriors. Even though Morant hasn’t produced very efficient shooting metrics in the postseason, the Murray State product has effectively transitioned into a supporting role. In that capacity, his rebound and assist numbers have been solid. “Morant is averaging close to 10.5 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game in the playoffs,” Manji says.  Plus, Morant has cleared this prop benchmark in six straight games for the Grizzlies. Add in that the Warriors’ defense ranks below average in opponent rebounding and assists per game amongst this year’s playoff teams and Manji expects Morant to clear this number for the seventh consecutive contest.
