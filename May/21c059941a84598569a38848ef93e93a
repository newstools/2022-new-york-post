After coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the first round against the Penguins in improbable fashion, the Rangers  went into Raleigh riding high for the second round. They could smell a Game 1 road victory to keep the good times rolling… and then the Hurricanes put in a rebound to tie the game at one with 2:23 remaining in the game. They would go on to win in overtime and hand the Rangers a gut-wrenching 2-1 loss. To talk about the loss and look ahead to Game 2, we bring you a new episode of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Ron Duguay and Mollie Walker. The Post’s Larry Brooks drops by to talk about what he saw from the Blueshirts in Game 1 and what may need to change if the Rangers want to pull off the upset this series.
