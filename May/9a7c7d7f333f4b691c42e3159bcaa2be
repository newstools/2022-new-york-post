The Rangers completed their series rally with a win over the Hurricanes on Monday, advancing to the Eastern Conference Final. Chris Kreider scored a pair of goals, Mika Zibanejad posted three assists, and Adam Fox a goal and a helper in a 6-2 pasting of Carolina in Game 7. Igor Shesterkin made 36 saves on the night, keeping the Hurricanes’ offense at bay. “He seems to raise his level every time we need him to,” Kreider said on “SportsCenter” after the win. “He’s so calm in net, handled the puck really well — that’s been huge for us too.” Despite finding themselves on the brink of elimination multiple times during these playoffs, there is plenty of belief in the Rangers locker room. “I think we’re a resilient group,” Adam Fox told ESPN. “Maybe we’re a little naive in here, we’re just coming to play. We don’t want our season to end. We come in with that mentality and it’s helped us a few times.” Despite maxing out their 2022 postseason playing time at 14 total games through two rounds, the Rangers are ready and raring to go. “Not sure there is a fatigue level right now,” Kreider said, “we’re playing pretty high.” As a reward for a second consecutive seven-game win, the Rangers will face the two-time defending Cup champion Lightning in the East final starting Wednesday — something they’re not taking lightly. “There’s a reason they’ve won back-to-back Stanley Cup,” Kreider said on “Sportscenter” following their Game 7 win.
