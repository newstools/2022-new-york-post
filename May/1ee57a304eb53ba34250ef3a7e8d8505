An 81-year-old woman was carjacked while she was handing out meals to homeless people outside of a supermarket in southern California, cops said. Nina Steinman was handing out food to the hungry in the parking lot of a Stater Bros in Redlands on Monday, which she told KTLA she had been doing regularly since January. While handing out the last of her homemade meals around 3:30 p.m., 24-year-old Roberto Carlos Sanchez Jr. approached Steinman’s silver vehicle and wrestled her keys from her, officials said. Video released by the Redlands Police Department allegedly shows Sanchez, dressed in all black, approach the back of the gray 2015 Kia Sportage while the trunk was propped open. After an apparent scuffle he runs into the driver’s seat and closes the door. Steinman can be seen trying to open the driver-side door to no avail. With the trunk still wide open, Sanchez Jr. quickly reverses out of the parking spot, dragging Steinman and knocking her to the ground as she holds on, video shows. He then speeds out of the parking lot as several witnesses try to stop him. Steinman was not seriously injured, but was left with bruises on her arm. The driver made off with her wallet and purse, the outlet reported. “Let me tell you, I’m not afraid,” the defiant senior told KTLA. “I was going to grab his shirt and just drag that little puppy right out of the front seat, but I couldn’t get the door open.” Police said the thief was spotted on the westbound 10 freeway with the rear hatch of the stolen car still open. The vehicle was also spotted on Wednesday in a parking structure in downtown Los Angeles, LAPD said. Sanchez Jr. was arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a stolen vehicle, cops told the outlet. He is being held at the  West Valley Detention Center in San Bernardino on charges of carjacking and elder abuse. His bail was set at $250,000, KTLA reported. Steinman, meanwhile, was reportedly heading to Los Angeles to retrieve her car — which is still drivable.
