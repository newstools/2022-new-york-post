It’s never too late to become a grad. Jessica Seinfeld — the wife of comedian Jerry Seinfeld — put on her cap and gown and strutted across the stage to receive her diploma from NYU’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service on May 25. The decorated author, 50, shared photos from the momentous occasion on Instagram as she celebrated becoming a graduate. Seinfeld beamed as she posed for photos with pals and classmates on the big day. “I spent the last two years learning alongside the best people working in public service @nyuwagner,” she posted to her over 500K Instagram followers. “So, on one of the darkest days in our country’s history, I feel hopeful that this group will help carry us, elevate us and advance us to a better place. I made lifelong friends and I could not feel more proud to be part of this truly remarkable cohort and the Wagner family.” In one snap, the “Vegan At Times” author posed for photos with sons Julian, 19, and Shepherd, 16, who seemingly attended the graduation ceremony. Seinfeld also posted a video of herself walking across the New York City Center stage to collect her diploma. The massive achievement comes hot on the heels of other notable celebs finally becoming college graduates. NBA star Stephen Curry, NFL Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis, former NFL star Colin Kaepernick, singer Taylor Swift, and actor Anthony Anderson successfully added yet another milestone to their already-long lists of achievements during this year’s graduation festivities.
