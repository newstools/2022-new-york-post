Johnny Depp’s former psychiatrist testified Thursday that the actor expressed “frustration” with Amber Heard during their marriage, comparing her to his abusive mother and calling her a “pain in the ass.” Dr. Alan Blaustein said in a deposition that Depp, 58, struggled to stay sober as his relationship with the 36-year-old actress crumbled. “He used drugs to cope with psychic wounds,” Blaustein said, according to a recording of his testimony played in court. The doctor said he expressed concern about Depp use of the ADHD medication Adderall and cited several instances in which the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star broke his promises to stay clean. According to a message sent to the doctor, Depp told Heard, “You’re being my mother and psychotic sister.” The actor has previously testified that his mom, Betty Sue Palmer, physically and psychologically abused him when he was growing up. In his notes from one of their sessions, Blaustein also said Depp referred to Heard as, “Such a pain in the ass.” He said the actor felt “frustration, impatience and anger” with Heard during their marriage. Blaustein, who was deposed in January 2022, also testified that Depp and Heard’s relationship issues started well before their doomed nuptials in February 2015. He recalled the actor saying he “might not want to go to marriage [at] 51 years old.” “[Their relationship was] a lot of love, a lot of disappointment, a lot of fear,” he said. Blaustein also testified that, despite the couple’s tumultuous time together, he did not recall any violence. Depp is now suing Heard for $50 million, claiming she defamed him in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she called herself “a public figure representing domestic abuse.” Heard is countersuing for $100 million, alleging that Depp launched a smear campaign against her that damaged her reputation and career. Blaustein was one of several witnesses the jury heard from Thursday, as both sides prepare to wrap up their arguments next week.
