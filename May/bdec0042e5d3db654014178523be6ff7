The Lakers head coach search will have to go on as the Sixers are sticking with Doc Rivers. In a press conference Friday — following the Sixers Game 6 elimination loss to the Heat in their Eastern Conference semifinals series — Daryl Morey, president of basketball operations of the Sixers, said Rivers will return as head coach next season. He has three years on his contract in Philadelphia. The news came after multiple reports this week said the Lakers were monitoring the situation closely in Philadelphia, and were interested in Rivers as a candidate for their head coach vacancy. “I don’t worry about my job,” Rivers said Thursday. “I think I do a terrific job and if you don’t then you should write it. I work my butt off to get this team here.” Before the Sixers’ collapse to the Heat in their Eastern Conference semifinals series on Thursday, Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke said earlier this week he believed the Lakers want to “bring back Doc.” That came after The Times published Plaschke’s hours-long interview with Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who expressed her frustration with the state of the team — which parted ways with former head coach Frank Vogel in April after the Lakers failed to make the playoffs. After Philadelphia’s 99-90 Game 6 loss, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst said on “Get Up” that the Lakers are “watching developments closely” in Philadelphia over the next few days because they will “definitely have interest” if Rivers is fired by the Sixers. The Lakers have already interviewed or requested interviews with at least six candidates, including Nets assistant Kenny Atkinson, Mark Jackson, Terry Stotts, Adrian Griffin, and Bucks assistants Darvin Ham and Charles Lee. Rivers’ postgame comments were quite glaring to some fans, who essentially believed he gave up on his team in the elimination game. “I came to the conclusion at the end of this game that we were not good enough to beat Miami,” said Rivers, who pulled his starters late in Game 6.
