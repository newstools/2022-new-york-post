Morale was not a problem. Fatigue could not be found — just the resilience of a team with the makeup to make a memorable postseason run. Returning to Madison Square Garden after a painful triple-overtime Game 1 loss to the Penguins, the Rangers bounced back to even their first-round series with last night’s 5-2 win. Igor Shesterkin followed up his remarkable 79-save effort in the opener to stop 39 shots, preventing the Rangers from giving away another multi-goal lead. The memory of the disheartening marathon loss quickly evaporated as Andrew Copp scored his second goal of the playoffs less than seven minutes into the game. Pittsburgh’s Jake Guentzel, who scored two goals in Game 1, responded to even the score, but Ryan Strome’s power-play goal and Chris Kreider’s second score of the series put the Rangers up for good. Sidney Crosby closed the gap, scoring with less than two minutes left in the second period, and the Penguins dominated play early in the third period, but Shesterkin wouldn’t bend, maintaining the form that will earn him the Vezina Trophy. Midway through the third, the star goaltender received some help. Artemi Panarin threw a puck from behind the net that bounced off the skate of Pittsburgh’s Mike Matheson and into the net. Frank Vatrano followed with a game-sealing goal.
