Run, Forrest, run … all the way to England! Tom Hanks’ famous character from 1994’s “Forrest Gump” made a surprise appearance on Tuesday at Paddington Station in London. A mystery man who looked eerily similar to the character was seen gazing at Queen Elizabeth during her visit to the new Elizabeth train line named in her honor for the Platinum Jubilee. Valentine Low, the royal correspondent for the Times of London, posted a pic of the day, showing the 96-year-old monarch sporting a bright, lemon-colored coat and matching hat. “The Queen, looking good in yellow,” Low penned alongside his now-viral snapshot. But in the distance, Forrest Gump seemingly popped up from behind a door, peering into the photo. While the man standing in the far back of the line to see the sovereign may have looked like Gump in all his buzz-cut, plaid-shirt-wearing glory, it wasn’t actually him. Hanks and his son, Chet, were seen at a Dodgers game in Los Angeles earlier this week, so it is highly unlikely he was anywhere near the United Kingdom. Fans, however, couldn’t help but have a little fun with Forrest’s would-be appearance, with one asking, “Anyone else clock Forrest Gump in the background?” and another tweeting: “I heard rumors that Forrest Gump is at the very back peeking out.” “@tomhanks is that you,” one tweeter asked the 65-year-old Oscar winner. Another person quipped, “I had to zoom right in to check if that was Forrest Gump,” while someone added, in a nod to a famous line from the film, “Mama always said meeting the Queen was like a box of chocolates.” Hanks won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the ’90s comedy-drama, which was directed by Robert Zemeckis. Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field also starred in the heartwarming tale of an Alabama man who somehow finds himself in the middle of several historical events of the 20th century.
