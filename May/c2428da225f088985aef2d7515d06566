A 10-year-old Long Island boy died during a Little League game when he suffered an epileptic seizure while running to first base — with his coach dad watching from the sidelines, a report said Monday. Lazar LaPenna, a fourth-grader at East School in Long Beach, collapsed on the field at Point Lookout Park in Lido Beach on Friday, Newsday said. Gregg LaPenna, who coached his son’s team, said his boy had been diagnosed with epilepsy several years ago and had managed the condition with medication. The shattered dad said his son’s death was not related to any baseball activity. Lazar had been thrilled to have gotten a hit earlier in the game, the outlet wrote. “This tragedy is sure to raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for students and staff, particularly for who are close to this family,” Dr. Jennifer Gallagher, superintendent of the school district where Lazar attended, wrote on Facebook. “All of our schools have a Crisis Intervention Team made up of a professionals trained to help with the needs of students, parents, and school personnel at difficult times such as this.” Little league officials said the entire LaPenna family had been deeply involved with their events for generations. “Our deepest sympathies go out to mother Monique, father and coach Gregg, brothers Gerry and Blaze, and the entire LaPenna family,” they said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with them all at this time.” The remainder of the season will be dedicated to Lazar and his memory, officials said.
