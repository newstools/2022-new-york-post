Josh Donaldson never seems to stay out of the headlines for something controversial. This time it is in reaction to calling Tim Anderson “Jackie” over the weekend. He received a one-game suspension and decided to appeal. Was the suspension just? Should he have got more games? Should have he appealed? Also, we are a quarter of the way through the MLB season… who are the award winners at this moment? All that and lots more are discussed on Episode 2 of “The Show” with The Post’s own baseball columnists Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman. New episodes of “The Show” with Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman will be released every Tuesday afternoon through the entire MLB season.
