Two Virginia grandparents are facing murder charges after a 7-year-old girl was mauled to death by the family’s Rottweiler, officials said. Little Olivia Grace Floyd’s parents are also facing felony charges in the deadly Jan. 29 attack at a residential home in Waynesboro, a city of 22,000 about a half hour drive from Charlottesville, authorities announced in a news release on Monday. Step-granddad Stephen Kachmar, 60, and grandma Penny Lee Bashlor, 64, are facing up to 70 years behind bars if they’re found guilty on charges of non-capital murder, involuntary manslaughter, child abuse and possession of a vicious dog, Waynesboro Police Department and the Augusta Sheriff’s Office said. Parents Brooks Anthony Floud, 39, and Alicia Rene Floyd, 37, were charged with cruelty/injure to a child, the release said. The grandparents are being held without bail after the four were indicted by a special grand jury, police said. Brooks Floyd was being held in Middle River Jail and Alicia Floyd was released on a bond last Friday, the police department said. Olivia was attacked by the dog on Parker Heights Road at about 2:26 p.m. on Jan. 29, police said. She was taken by ambulance to Augusta Health where she later died from her injuries. Another woman was also injured, but police didn’t identify her. The 4-year-old dog was seized and has since be euthanized, according to the Staunton News Leader. The dog was known to be dangerous, a neighbor told the News Leader in the aftermath of the killing. A day after Olivia’s death, Kachmar was given a summons for harboring a dangerous dog, according to the publication. Olivia was remembered in her obituary as a second-grader who loved cheerleading, gymnastics, dance, unicorns and animals. Her family requested those attending her funeral wear clothing “congruent with a celebration,” including the child’s favorite colors punk and purple.
