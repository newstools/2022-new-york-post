A sledgehammer-wielding robber smashed through a Bronx jewelry store’s front window, snatching $20,000 in chains and pendants, surveillance video obtained by The Post Wednesday shows. Screams can be heard on the video from inside M & NP Jewelers on White Plains Road during the smash and grab around 4 p.m. Sunday – before a roll-down gate nearly ensnares the culprit. A witness told the NYPD “three unknown individuals broke the store window with a sledgehammer” and “removed assorted jewelry,” police said in a statement. The video shows the robber who wielded the sledgehammer shoving the baubles into a bag held by a second man. It’s not clear what the third man was doing, cops said. The chains and pendants were worth about $20,000, cops said. There were no threats or injuries reported. The robbers took off south on White Plains Road in a black BMW, cops said. A group of thieves stole about $50,000 in another smash and grab about 2 1/2 miles away in the Bronx in April. It wasn’t clear if the two cases were connected. The thieves in that case also fled in a black sedan.
