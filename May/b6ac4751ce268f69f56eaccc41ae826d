If the leaked draft US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade becomes official, a Texas “trigger law” already on the books could restrict virtually all abortions in the Lone Star State within a month of the decision. In 2021, Texas passed a law that would restrict abortions within 30 days of any high court ruling giving states the authority to outlaw abortions. Anyone who performs or helps provide an abortion could also be charged with a felony. The law, which would restrict abortions starting at conception, makes no exceptions to end a pregnancy due to rape, incest, fetal abnormality or when a fetus is not expected to survive after birth. The one exemption it does make is when the life or heath of the mother is at risk. Texas currently has a controversial abortion law in place that restricts abortions after six weeks. The Supreme Court has allowed it to remain in place. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, Texas also has additional, older abortion laws that would kick in and could be used to prosecute abortion providers or funds, experts believe. The Supreme Court has not made a final ruling on abortion. Monday night, a majority opinion that was written by Justice Samuel Alito and leaked to Politico signaled the court could be on the verge of ending abortion rights for women.
