There’s plenty of fish in the sea, but only a few that can be delivered to your doorstep. If you want the latter and don’t feeling like going “fishing”, heading to your local grocery store or fish market, these seafood delivery services are for you. When we rounded up the best meat delivery companies, we realized that we shouldn’t let fresh shrimp, salmon, lobster and other seafood, swim past us. We found a few different brands that specialize in the treasures from the sea. Read on for companies that sell and ship fresh seafood and fish right to your doorstep, ranging in cuts, catches and price to please any pescatarian or fish lover. For fresh fish, oysters and even decadent caviar, check out Citarella. The retailer ships nationwide, but for NYC locals or those in Connecticut or the Hamptons, you can also pick up your fish from the brick and mortar market. For everyone else, browse seafood, caviar and bundles perfect for a party or even a solo seafood buffet. There is nothing better than the sizzle of fresh fish in a pan of butter or shrimp on the grill. Get both and so much more from Sizzlefish. The seafood service sells all sorts of fish from cod to catfish as well as shellfish including crab, lobster, oysters and more. They also have a subscription service, starting at $7.99 per serving. You heard the brand — go get some Maine lobster. This is a great idea, especially for those that love lobster but don’t live up in Maine where the shellfish is undeniably the best.  They carry live lobsters that are caught in the mornings and then arrive at your door the very next day. They also sell lobster rolls and other fresh fish like scallops, muscles and more. For pure cuts of portioned and cleaned fish, turn to PureFish. The seafood company curates boxes of restaurant-quality fish and seafood, arriving in oven-ready trays that can be taken right from the box or fridge into the oven and then onto the plate. Boxes start at $125 and always include free shipping. Circle this brand and star it, too, if you love salmon, shrimp and tuna. Blue Circle Foods has an array of salmon choices, including salmon burgers and sausages perfect for the grill, smoked salmon for your bagels and cuts of cod, salmon and shrimp. Lobster anywhere, you say? It’s true, if you live in the USA. LobersterAnywhere ships live lobsters right to your door, as well as lobster tails, lobster rolls and more. Plus, they also have fresh shrimp, scallops, chowder and even surf and turf packages. Flowers, chocolates and fish? All three can be found on this website. VitalChoice is the seafood sister site of 1-800-Flowers, Harry & David and more, making it a great place to stock up for a barbecue. They have wild salmon and wild white fish, as well as shellfish like shrimp, crab and lobster. Did you know Omaha Steaks goes beyond the beef? The meat company also delivers fresh fish and seafood, including shrimp, lobster tail, mahi mahi, caviar and more. You can shop by fish fillets to see all the choices and then head to the shellfish page to shop for oysters and muscles. Have the variety of a full fish market without leaving home on Fulton Fish Market’s website. Like in a real market, you can shop by cut (whole fish, fillets, butterfly cuts and portioned pieces), in addition to shopping by type of fish, shellfish and specialty fish like octopus and sea urchin, plus others.
