A Queens man was arrested on charges he raped a 13-year-old girl on Long Island, police said. Andrew Ramsaroop, 30, of South Ozone Park, allegedly met the girl via Snapchat, then rendezvoused with her at a playground in Hauppauge where he raped her, cops said. Ramsaroop allegedly set the wheels in motion for the heinous act when he met up with the girl at the Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove on May 13, officials said. At that time, he tried to coax the girl and her friend into his vehicle, but was rebuffed, investigators said. The rape occurred later the same day, police said. Detectives arrested Ramsaroop on Friday night, authorities said, noting the girl informed a school official about the rape and the school notified police. Ramsaroop was charged with second-degree rape, second-degree criminal sexual act, and endangering the welfare of a child, authorities said. Ramsaroop was scheduled to be arraigned Saturday at First District Court in Central Islip, officials said. “The investigation is continuing,” a Fourth Squad detective told the Post early Saturday afternoon. Anyone with information is asked to call the Fourth Squad at 631-854-8452 or anonymously to Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS.
