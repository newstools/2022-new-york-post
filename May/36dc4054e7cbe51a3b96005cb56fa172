The feud between Warriors fans and Charles Barkley appeared to reach a new level Thursday night. Once Golden State knocked off the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, the postgame coverage commenced on TNT’s “Inside the NBA” – with Warriors fans seemingly tossing yellow T-shirts in Barkley’s direction. Barkley, who originally picked the Mavericks to win the series, then approached the railing, where he stared out into a sea of San Francisco fans as his colleagues, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson, told him to take a seat. Earlier in the day, Barkley was also showered with pleasantries from Warriors fans who chanted, “Chuck you suck!” outside the Chase Center, with Shaquille O’Neal also appearing to get in on the action. The Warriors defeated the Mavericks, 120-110, with Golden State’s Klay Thompson putting up 32 points. Golden State will either face the Miami Heat or Boston Celtics, the latter of which currently holds a 3-2 series lead in the Eastern Conference Finals. Game 6 between the Celtics and Heat gets underway Friday night in Boston. Meanwhile, Barkley noted postgame that he isn’t sure what’s next for the Mavericks, who only defeated the Warriors once in the series. “They’re not gonna get better than Denver… The Lakers are gonna do something. They’re not gonna be better than the Warriors,” Barkley said, according to Clutch Points. “My favorite next year is gonna be the Clippers.”
