The man who was at the center of a wild incident involving an escaped pet tiger in Houston last year was found guilty of an unrelated murder Tuesday. Following a two-week trial, a Fort Bend County jury convicted 27-year-old Victor Cuevas of fatally shooting Oseikhuemen Omobhude on July 14, 2017, outside a Richmond restaurant, reported ABC13. Cuveas was arrested two weeks after the killing and charged with first-degree murder in Omobhube’s death. The suspect claimed that he shot the 20-year-old in self-defense after Omobhude pulled a gun on him outside a sushi restaurant, according to court records cited by the Houston Chronicle. In May 2021, Cuevas was out on bond in connection with the murder case when he was caught on video corralling a Bengal tiger named India after the big cat had escaped from a private home in west Houston and was spotted by an off-duty sheriff’s deputy sitting on a lawn. Surveillance cameras showed Cuevas ushering the wild animal into a white Jeep Cherokee and speeding away before cops responded to the scene. The video quickly went viral and made national headlines, sparking a hunt for the 9-month-old tiger and its caretaker. Cuevas’ defense lawyer in the murder case told reporters at the time that his client was looking after India the tiger but was not the animal’s owner. Cuevas was ultimately arrested and charged with felony evading arrest. Cuevas’ wife turned India the tiger over to the authorities a week later. The large predator was found to be in good health and was sent to live out its days at a wooded sanctuary on a ranch in north Texas.
