This was a weekend to remember for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Christen Harper. Taking to her Instagram Stories on Sunday, Harper — the longtime girlfriend of Lions quarterback Jared Goff — gave fans a peek at the Hollywood, Fla., launch party for the 2022 issue of the iconic mag, in which she is featured. In one video, Harper and other Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models are seen getting playful in front of the mirror as they create TikTok videos. She also shared a video from Sunday’s sweat sesh with her peers. Hours earlier on Saturday, Harper hit the red carpet with Goff, 27, whom she has been linked to since early 2019. She later posed with fellow Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Camille Kostek, who appeared on the publication’s cover in 2019. Kostek was also joined on the red carpet by her longtime NFL beau, free-agent tight end Rob Gronkowski. Before jetting to Florida, Harper and company spent time in New York, where they attended an additional launch event for this year’s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. During Thursday’s bash, which took place at the Hard Rock Hotel, guests were treated to a show-stopping performance from Ciara, one of this year’s four cover stars. Harper made her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit debut last year after posting an audition video on Instagram, where she spoke about what the magazine has meant to her. “I am SO excited to finally go after one of my wildest dreams. @si_swimsuit has meant so much more than a magazine to me, it gave me the confidence to embrace who I am and ultimately chase my dreams,” Harper shared in 2020. “I want to inspire other women to feel the same way and to treat their body the way they would a best friend…love her, respect her and ultimately believe in her!” she later added.
