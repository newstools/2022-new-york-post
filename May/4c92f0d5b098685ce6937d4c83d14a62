A New York City high school is giving Fyre Festival a run for its money — with barebones lunches one student-run Instagram account has likened to “slathered diarrhea all over my plate.” The anonymous account, @bsqelunch, has been documenting the unsavory provisions at the Baccalaureate School for Global Education in Queens for about four months — and the reviews are not so flattering. “Mac n cheese: tastes as bad as it looks,” read the teen critic’s most recent review of a small mound of dry orange-hued noodles alongside a beige bread roll. “I could recreate this same exact taste by spraying some easy cheese on some cardboard then stuffing it into a dirty sock and preheating that roll in 375 for 10 minutes,” the caption said. “Overall: 3/10 gonna take a break from school food again.” The student-critic has described the school cafeteria’s broccoli as tasting “like grass water” and its dumplings as “turds that were ripped apart by paper shredders.” “Blander than cardboard and looks very unappetizing,” the Jan. 13 dumpling review reads. In one review from Jan. 20 of a lunch consisting of a single plastic-wrapped red apple and dark red muffin, the high schooler joked that they got “a full platter today.” The account has a loyal following among BSGE’s student body, who have added their own commentary in the account’s replies. “I can’t wait for frozen fruit cup day I am hoping for a delectable capture,” one fan snarked on a March 1 post featuring what looked like a stale grilled cheese, 12 French fries and two packets of ketchup. “The fries is on god the best dish,” remarked another person. The account’s anonymous owner could not be reached for comment. A rep for New York City’s Department of Education did not immediately return an inquiry from The Post.
