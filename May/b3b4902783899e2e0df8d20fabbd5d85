An NYPD officer was bitten in the head by a charging pit bull Sunday while responding to a report of an armed gunman on Coney Island. The officer was chasing the armed suspect at around 6:10 p.m. when the suspect ran into a home on Neptune Avenue and West 35th Street and unleashed two hounds from inside the building. One of the dogs ran out, charged the cop and bit him in the head. Another officer pulled out his gun and shot the pit bull, police said. The cop was rushed to an area hospital for the bite wound, which is not believed to be life-threatening. The officer who shot the dog was also taken to the hospital for routine evaluation for shooting a firearm, according to police. The dog is expected to survive. The suspect, meanwhile, has barricaded himself inside the home and remains at large.
