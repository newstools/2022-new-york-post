An Indiana man fatally shot two armed intruders in his home and then held two others at gunpoint during a bizarre burglary where he knew at least one of the would-be thieves, reports said. The deadly incident came just one day after the same group had allegedly taken cash from him, the homeowner claimed in newly revealed court documents. A woman who survived the botched burglary had stayed with him several times over the years, he later told cops. The homeowner told police he was awakened while it was still dark Sunday by the sound of his dog barking and found three people in his home in Auburn, a small city in the northern part of the state just west of Ohio, WPTA-TV reported. He said the thieves held a gun to his head, took items and demanded cash — but accepted a check for $500 after he said they’d cleaned him out by taking $65 the day before, according to court records cited by the station. The homeowner, who hasn’t been identified, was able to grab his shotgun and fatally shot Dylan Morefield and Rameica Moore, the records said. He then escorted his acquaintance Tabitha Johnson, 42, outside the home, where alleged lookout man Shaun Kruse, 42, was standing, WPTA said. He then forced Kruse to dial 911, the station said. Police arrested Johnson and Kruse and slapped them with murder and burglary charges, WPTA previously reported. The homeowner later revealed that the four had been at his house the day before, with Johnson saying she needed thousands of dollars because some people thought she had “stolen it from them,” the court records said. He turned over all of his cash, but they demanded more and asked to go to his bank, which was closed for the day. The homeowner isn’t facing charges.
