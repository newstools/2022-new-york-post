Next time you are posting pictures of yourself on the beach on social media, you might want to think twice about who you are sharing it with. Experts have warned that Brits who post vacation snaps online could be left thousands of dollars out of pocket. This is because it could invalidate your insurance if your home is broken into while on vacation. As you showed your property was empty, it could be used against you for liability and leave you thousands of pounds out of pocket. A survey in 2019 found that one in 12 Britons have been burgled after bragging on social media, after tagging their location as away from home. Finance expert Holly Bennett from NerdWallet, said you should think twice. She told WalesOnline: “At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, you could be creating easy pickings for potential thieves while your home is unoccupied. “If you make a claim after a break-in that happened while you were away, and the insurer checks your profile, these social media posts may not help your cause.” Other experts have also chimed in about the risk it causes. Ruby Gonzalez, Communications Director of NordVPN previously told Cosmopolitan: “Although it’s fun to post vacation photos and let everyone know you’re having a cocktail on a sunny beach, that sends a clear signal to burglars that your home is empty.” ABTA currently warns: “Be mindful of what you write or photos you share on social media which could identify you as being away on holiday.” If you want to share pictures, you are best to do it when you return from vacation. Or if you are desperate to share the images during the trip make sure your accounts are private, or only set to friends and family. Sharing pics when you are off your vacation is okay – here are the UK’s most Instagrammed picnic spots. Don’t use the free WiFi on vacation though – using free WiFi spots when on vacation puts you at risk of being hacked. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
