It’s over for NASCAR racer Kurt Busch and his wife, Ashley. Ashley Busch filed for divorce in Florida earlier this month, stating her five-year union with Busch is “irretrievably broken,” according to court documents obtained by TMZ Sports. “I am heartbroken to confirm that my wife Ashley and I are working to dissolve our marriage. Divorce is a personal and private matter and I hope our privacy will be respected,” Busch said Tuesday in a statement. Ashley, a polo player, had married Busch in 2017. She claims in court documents their marriage began to fizzle in April, accusing the 43-year-old driver of cutting her off from credit cards and their joint bank account. Further, she also alleged Busch “committed a tortious act.” The couple does have a prenup, per the docs. Ashley and Busch have made appearances together both on and off the track over the years, including the NASCAR Awards back in December 2021. Busch took the checkered flag over the weekend at the NASCAR Cup Series at the Kansas Speedway.
