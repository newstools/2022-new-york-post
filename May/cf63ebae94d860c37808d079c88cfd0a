A federal grand jury has indicted accused subway gunman Frank James for committing a terrorist attack on a mass transit system, a crime that could result in life in prison if he is convicted. The indictment, handed up in Brooklyn federal court Friday, also accuses James of firing a gun during a violent crime. If convicted of that count, James faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum of life. James, 62, is accused of opening fire on a crowded rush-hour train in Sunset Park April 12, shooting 10 people. If found guilty, the government will seek forfeiture of James’ assets, including a 9 mm Glock pistol seized in Brooklyn, the indictment says. The case was assigned to Judge William Kuntz and no date has been set for James’ arraignment. A lawyer for James did not immediately return a request for comment.
