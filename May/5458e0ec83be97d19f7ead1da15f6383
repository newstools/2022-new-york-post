There are some Knicks fans who look at the team-building process as one that should be focused solely on the future, gathering assets and draft picks to slowly construct a roster that might someday contend for something. It’s a plan that can be painful to watch each season aside from draft night. For those who want the Knicks to be a solid, respectable, playoff team a lot sooner than that, let me introduce you to Pacers point guard Malcolm Brogdon. The University of Virginia alum averaged 19.1 points, 5.9 assists and 5.1 rebounds last season. He shot 44.8 percent overall (31.2 percent from 3) and is a terrific free-throw shooter. Now 29, Brogdon is set to make $22.6 million next season in the final year of his contract. And according to NBA sources, he is available in a trade for the right package, a possibility that has some members of the Knicks front office intrigued if they strike out on free agent Jalen Brunson. It’s true that the Knicks have a lot of voices in the front office — some would say too many. But it’s also clear that if the Knicks were able to land Brogdon for a package along the lines of Miles McBride, Kemba Walker, Nerlens Noel, a 2022 second-round pick and a 2023 first-round selection they have via the Mavericks, the 6-foot-5, six-year veteran would be their most equipped starting point guard since Stephon Marbury.
