Top lawyer and anti-trust law pioneer Ira M. Millstein, 95, and his wife Susan, 63, have taken a hit selling their Upper East Side home. The fourth-floor, two-bedroom, two-bath unit is at posh 930 Fifth Ave., where Woody Allen once lived in the penthouse. It sold for $2.1 million, according to property records. The couple bought it for $2.45 million in 2015, two years after they got married, and listed it for $2.3 million last September. Millstein served as chairman of antitrust law sections of the American Bar Association and the New York State Bar Association, and counseled the boards of General Motors, Westinghouse, WellChoice and the Nature Conservancy, among others. He’s also the founding chair of the Ira M. Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership at Columbia Law School. The top-notch digs are in an Emery Roth-designed Art Deco building at 74th Street, across from the Model Boat Pond in Central Park. The home opens to a foyer that leads to a living/dining room with beamed ceilings, crown moldings and custom built-ins. The buyer is Susan Hermann. The listing brokers were Michael J. Franco, Miriam Richards, Greg Holzmann and Veronica Hinman of Compass, who declined comment. The buyer was repped by Corcoran’s Deborah Kern.
