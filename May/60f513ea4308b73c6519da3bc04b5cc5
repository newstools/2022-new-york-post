Rihanna never disappoints, and that goes for her Fenty Eau de Parfum ($140) as well. The unisex fragrance created by Queen Ri Ri is spicy and sweet, made for all people and embodies feeling of confidence. “A woman is supposed to smell powerful and confident. And sexy,” Rihanna said about the fragrance. “What does that smell like? Because you can’t really put a scent into adjectives. But it means whatever makes her feel that way. Whatever scent connects her to the memory or feeling of empowerment, confidence and sexiness.” After selling out twice since the fragrance’s initial 2021 launch, the coveted bottle of perfume is finally restocked. It’s available for limited presale right now at fentybeauty.com until its May 6 release. But we wouldn’t wait to get your hands on this coveted bottle of luxe and allure, as it’s guaranteed to sell out yet again. Keep reading to shop the perfume as well as the rest of Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty collection.
