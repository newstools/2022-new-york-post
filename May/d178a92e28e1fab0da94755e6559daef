Two of the USFL’s best offenses meet on Sunday when the New Jersey Generals (1-1) battle the Philadelphia Stars (1-1). The difference is one team excels on the ground, and the other gets it done through the air. The Generals use a two-quarterback system, but whoever is under center will most likely be handing the ball off. Through two games, New Jersey leads the USFL in rushing attempts per game (38) and rushing yards per game (168). The Generals’ ground game should continue to roll on Sunday. Philadelphia has struggled to stop the run, allowing an average of 147 yards per game through the first two weeks. Both the New Orleans Breakers and Pittsburgh Maulers went over 120 yards rushing against the Stars. The Stars entered Week 2 averaging 215.5 passing yards per game, tops in the USFL. Philadelphia quarterback Bryan Scott leads the league in passing yards (474) and passing touchdowns (4).  The Generals allowed just 109 passing yards to Michigan last week but the Panthers have the worst offense in the USFL. In Week 1 when New Jersey faced Birmingham – the league’s highest-scoring offense – the Generals gave up 205 yards and two touchdowns through the air. Look for Scott to have his way with New Jersey’s secondary. The total for this game is set at 40.5. That’s a couple of points too low for two offenses whose strengths match up well with the opposing defenses. I expect both teams to score 20-plus points. The play: Generals-Stars Over 40.5.
