Nathan Eovaldi will not want to remember Tuesday’s second inning versus the Astros. In it, Houston hit a whopping five home runs in an eventual 13-4 win over the Red Sox. First it was Yordan Alvarez. Then it was Kyle Tucker. It was Jeremy Pena’s turn next. Michael Brantley got in on the fun. Finally, Yuli Gurriel sent Eovadi packing after 1 2/3 innings. By the end of the onslaught, it was 9-1 Astros, and Tyler Danish was called in for relief. Eovaldi became just the third pitcher in Major League Baseball history to ever allow five home runs in a single inning. in 2021, he allowed just 15 home runs in 32 starts. Per ESPN, it was the first time the Red Sox had given up five long balls in a single inning — and the first time Houston accomplished the feat. “We got five on it,” the Astros’ social media account tweeted, referencing the classic 1995 song by the rap duo Luniz. The other two pitchers who have given up five home runs in one inning were Chase Anderson for the Blue Jays in 2020 and Michael Blazek for the Brewers in 2017.
