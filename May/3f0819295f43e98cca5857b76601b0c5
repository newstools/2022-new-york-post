The man who accused CNN’s Don Lemon of assaulting him in a Sag Harbor bar three years ago has dropped his lawsuit. “After a lot of inner reflection and a deep dive into my memory, I have come to realize that my recollection of the events that occurred on the night in question when I first met CNN anchor Don Lemon were not what I thought they were when I filed this lawsuit,” plaintiff Dustin Hice said in a statement. Hice’s filing in 2019 claimed that Lemon, 56, displayed a pattern of “aggression and hostility.” He alleged in his suit that Lemon had put his hand down his own pants, rubbed his private parts and then shoved his fingers into Hice’s face. Hice also went on “The Megan Kelly Show” late last year, commenting that the accused behavior could be part of a “pattern.” On March 23, US Magistrate Judge Thomas Locke ruled that Hice must pay Lemon $77,000 in attorney fees for destroying or at least tampering with evidence and trying to bribe witnesses, according to Deadline. Lemon’s attorney Caroline Polisi released a statement after Hice retracted his allegations saying the case was “a crass money grab from its inception.” “This has been a long and difficult journey for Don,” the statement said. “Out of respect for the judicial process and my advice, he has had to remain silent in the face of a malicious and vulgar attack on his character.” “Unfortunately, being a gay black man in the media, he has had to deal with these sorts of attacks for quite some time,” Polisi added. Lemon’s lawyer said the CNN anchor is “looking forward to moving on with his life.”
