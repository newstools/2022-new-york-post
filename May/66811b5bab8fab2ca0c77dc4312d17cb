Soccer legend Michael Owen is reportedly furious after his 19-year-old daughter, Gemma Owen, was mistaken for an OnlyFans model, whose explicit photos were leaked online. Gemma took to her Instagram story to say that she is not the individual in the leaked explicit photos — and shared a tweet by a model named “Jill,” who said it was her in the “nudes.” Gemma wrote on Instagram: “Apparently some guy is circulating pictures trying to claim it’s me. These pictures were taken off this girl’s OnlyFans. These images are clearly not me. Thank you to this girl for clearing it up. Just for the record, I do NOT have OnlyFans.” Gemma wrote the message over a screen-grab of Jill’s tweet that read: “When my nudes get leaked everywhere and people think its Michael Owens daughter? I’m actually knocked sick and I’m not even gonna bother staying quiet on it because too many people have sent it to me now, its the fact that men are getting off to the fact it could be a teen.” Jill also took to Twitter and Instagram to ask her thousands of followers how she can get paid or sue over the situation. The former soccer star is also worried that the OnlyFans photo mixup could impact his daughter’s beachwear business, OG Beachwear, according to the Daily Mail. “Michael is horrified his daughter’s name is being used out of turn and all he wants is for this situation to be rectified,” a source told the Daily Mail. “It is clearly not Gemma in the images; she doesn’t use OnlyFans, and is only ever pictured in a bikini to promote her brand. He’s a protective father and now Gemma is getting older, he wants to do everything he can to look after her image and reputation.” Gemma was all smiles with her dad on Thursday, amid the photo drama, as the father-daughter duo attended Ladies Day at Chester racecourse. The teen is an experienced equestrian.
