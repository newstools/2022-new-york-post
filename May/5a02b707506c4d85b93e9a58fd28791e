Ever wanted your own bowling alley? You may be able to achieve it using free wooden pallets. TikTok user Luke Philpott, who posts under @itslukephilpott, showed how he had made his own DIY version on a budget in the back garden — and people are seriously impressed. He uploaded a video with the caption “Here’s an idea for the summer” and it has racked up nearly a million likes. Luke said: “I built a bowling alley in the garden from old pallets. “It has a skittle reset system and a ball return ramp.” In a previous video, he explained how he managed to build it himself. Luke said: “I started by laying down eight pallets in a row and then screwed them all together and made sure they were all level. “And then I went through and put the boards down that were going to be used as the surface of the lane. “Then I went and screwed all the barriers to either side so that the balls wouldn’t hit the fence or fall off onto the grass and then started working on the ball return systems. “As you can see I have a ramp at the end that the balls will roll down.” Inside the bowling “hut” he added a beam that would have all the skittles attached to with string. The pins were then connected via the string to a few wheels, so they could be lifted and lowered at the end of each go for resetting the lane. He said: “As you can see I’ve just bowled a ball and knocked them all over. “The pins go up, the ball comes back to me and the pins go down. “As you can see it’s worked perfectly. “I’m really happy with how it’s turned out.” Many people were extremely impressed with his home project. One said: “this is sooo cool!!!” Another added: “I gonna do this in my garden.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
