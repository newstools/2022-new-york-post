Wonder if she wanted fries with that shake. A pregnant woman with a craving for fast food was not McLovin’ the service she received at a McDonald’s in Lakeland, Florida. “She was McMad,” joked Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd during a Friday press conference, sharing that a warrant is out for her arrest. Judd later described, “As Jones got to the exit, she turned toward the employees, lifted her shirt to expose her belly, then turned and began twerking at them.” “She didn’t get her Happy Meal or her fish sandwich or her chocolate shake, or her sweet tea, but she managed to get herself into a lot of McTrouble,” the cop added. On Thursday, Tianis Jones, 22, grew upset with the time it took to put together her drive-thru order, so she entered the restaurant to give employees a piece of her mind. Jones allegedly threw a small plastic sign and several bottles at one worker, then went behind the counter and threw cups on the floor and at employees, sheriffs said. One of Jones’ relatives reportedly intervened to calm her down, but the angry mother-to-be called 911 instead. “I’m 5 months pregnant. These people don’t know how to run a f- -king McDonald’s,” she told workers after being asked several times to leave the dining room, according to ABC affiliate WFTV. Investigators said Jones’ relative and another woman eventually convinced her to leave the store. The whole ordeal lasted about 10 minutes, and caused about $100 worth of damage. “She ended up a ‘McBurglar’ — she committed a burglary and an assault, which is a first-degree felony,” Judd said, in a variation on the franchise mascot the Hamburglar. “I don’t know why this woman got as angry as she was, but as the saying goes, she’s a few fries short of a Happy Meal,” he added. “She better not complain about the food we serve her at the county jail.”
