A TikToker claims flight attendants threatened to throw her off a plane if she refused to “cover-up” her chest. The user, @badbish1078, shared a clip on TikTok of her defiantly sitting on board the Alaska Airlines plane. A note over the video reads: “Alaska Airlines just told me I had to ‘cover-up’ if I wanted to get on the plane”. In the clip, she can be seen wearing a low-cut top and shorts. The TikToker told her viewers she said “no” to the demand – which has been branded “ridiculous” by her followers. One wrote: “What the hell”. Another said: “Who am I throwing hands with.” A third commented: “You’re kidding”. It comes after a former Love Island Australia star says she was “s*** shamed” on board a flight to Bali. She says she didn’t think twice about the jersey black crop-top and khaki cargo-trousers she was wearing until she boarded the plane, when she was told her outfit violated the airline’s dress code. Describing how she’d been “s*** shamed”, the social media star explained: “A male flight attendant just told me to cover-up and my clothing was too revealing. “I can’t wear this and it’s inappropriate to wear on JetStar. NEVER heard of this.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
