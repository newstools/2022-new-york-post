Howard Deering Johnson may have created the namesake Howard Johnson’s chain of restaurants and hotels, but he called Fifth Avenue home. Now his former pad at 812 Fifth Ave. — where US Vice President Nelson Rockefeller once owned a unit — has listed for $6.49 million. The two- to three-bedroom co-op is in a 19-story building. The “classic 7” apartment opens to a foyer that leads to a marble-floored entrance gallery, an open living room with Central Park views, a formal dining room and a library (or flexible third bedroom) with custom built-ins, a recessed ceiling and park-facing windows. There’s also a windowed eat-in kitchen and a main bedroom with two walk-in closets. The current seller is the estate of a woman who bought the co-op from Johnson. The listing broker is Iman Bacodari Barkhordari, of Douglas Elliman. In addition, Ralph Nakash — the buyer of the Rockefeller unit — is also in contract to sell a sixth-floor unit in the building. Nakash got his start founding the Jordache jeans empire but has since moved into multiple businesses, including real estate and hotels. He bought the Central Park-facing three-bedroom spread for $6.9 million in 2014 — a year after he made waves buying the Versace mansion in South Beach. The 2,830-square-foot residence was last asking $7.99 million, down from $9.9 million in 2021 — which means he is “taking a hit,” an insider says, since he spent more on renovations than he will get back from the sale. Nakash completely renovated the space, which boasts an oak-paneled entry gallery, marble and stone floors, art walls and recessed lighting. There’s also a 31-foot-long living room with park views, a decorative fireplace and handstitched leather wall panels — along with a formal dining room and a bar. The listing broker is Douglas Elliman’s Emily Sertic.
