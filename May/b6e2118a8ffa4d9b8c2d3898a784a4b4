A mugger slugged a Harlem straphanger and shoved him down the stairs before swiping his wallet, cops said. The 50-year-old male victim was waiting on the northbound C train platform at the 145th Street station around 4:30 p.m. April 14 when the suspect walked up to him and demanded, “Give me money,” authorities said. The victim refused and walked away – prompting the suspect to follow him, according to police. The brute then punched the victim in the face, hit him in the head with a glass bottle and shoved him down a flight of stairs before snatching his wallet, cops said. The victim refused medical attention, police said. The suspect – shown in surveillance images released late Tuesday – fled the station and is still on the lam.
