She set her sights sky-high for her centennial birthday. A courageous Florida woman who once tended to injured soldiers on the frontlines of World War II marked her 100th birthday this week by leaping out of an airplane, according to a report. Raymonde Sullivan, of Sebastian, had once pledged to disbelieving friends that she would take the pulse-pounding plunge if she made it into triple digits, NBC 5 reported. Accustomed to feats of bravery, she made good on that promise Monday. “I had never done it,” she told NBC 5 after landfall. “And I’ve done a lot things in 100 years. I thought I must do it while i can.” Originally from England, Sullivan had served as a nurse during World War II and was tasked with caring for wounded soldiers, according to the outlet. Still fearless more than 70 years later, Sullivan coolly hopped out of the plane with an instructor and made a successful landing. “It was scary,” she said. “I would say it is.” While Sullivan was pleased with her feat, she said it was a one-off experience. Asked if she planned to do it again, there was no hesitation. “No,” she said with a laugh. “No.”
