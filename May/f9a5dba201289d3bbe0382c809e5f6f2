The US Justice Department on Tuesday asked a federal appeals court to overturn last month’s court order which found the government’s mask mandate on mass transit was unlawful. The White House had said it would no longer enforce the COVID-19 precaution on airplanes, buses, trains and in transit hubs hours after the ruling by Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, an appointee of President Donald Trump. Mizelle had ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed to properly explain its decision to impose the mandate or follow proper rule-making procedures. Federal officials still contend that the January 2021 CDC order was within the government’s legal authority. The Justice Department appealed the Florida judge’s ruling at the behest of the CDC, which argued last month that “an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public’s health.” With Post wires
