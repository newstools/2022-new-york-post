Expect the Big Apple to sizzle this weekend. Excessive heat will descend upon the tri-state region starting late Friday into Saturday — when temperatures are expected to hover in the mid-80s, some 10 degrees higher than average for late May, forecasters said. The summer-like feel is expected to continue into Sunday, with a high of 92 degrees in Central Park, Fox Weather meteorologist Dylan DeBruyn told The Post. “We’re going to see all the heat in the South and in Texas move its way here,” DeBruyn said, adding that the only areas of the Northeast expected to escape the rising mercury are coastal regions in southern New England and Long Island. Saturday’s record for Central Park of 93 degrees set in 1996 isn’t likely to be surpassed, but Sunday’s temperature could reach 92, inching near the record of 96 set in 1941. “We’ll be a lot closer Sunday,” DeBruyn said of the record-breaking potential. Records could break at the city’s airports on Sunday, however, including the 94-degree mark at LaGuardia Airport in Queens set in 1992. Elsewhere throughout the eastern US, potential records could be set as far south as Richmond, Virginia, where Saturday’s high is expected to reach 99 degrees. It will also be especially hot Saturday in Philadelphia, where the city’s all-time record high of 95 degrees set in 1934 is expected to fall to a projected temperature of 98. “I think that one will likely be broken,” DeBruyn said. Those looking to enjoy the summer weather should take basic precautions like staying hydrated and seeking shade, DeBruyn added. “It’s just going to feel like a mid- to late summer day,” he said.
