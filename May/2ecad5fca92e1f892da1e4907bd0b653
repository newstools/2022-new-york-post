The NBA returns to action Friday after a day off and Monique, the Parlay Queen of the Action Network, has two player prop bets to share (video above). For her first selection, Monique is looking to the Eastern Conference matchup between the Miami Heat and Philadelphia 76ers, a series in which the Heat lead 2-0. In that game, she’s backing James Harden under 2.5 three-pointers made. The reasoning? Miami has proved exceptional at defending the arc and possesses a great defense overall. “[The Heat] defensively ranked first in the league in three-point percentage, field goals allowed, field goal percentage and second in total points allowed,” Monique says. Plus, it has been quite a while since Harden has cleared this benchmark from beyond the arc. He hasn’t done so since the Sixers’ first playoff on April 16 against the Raptors. Thus, in a game that is expected to be very low-scoring, back the under on Harden three-pointers tonight in Game Three. As for her second play, Monique is looking out west to Game 3 between the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns, which brings a 2-0 advantage to Dallas. In that game, Monique is backing Mikal Bridges over 4.5 rebounds. Although Bridges isn’t normally associated with his rebounding production, the Villanova product has logged big minutes this series and has proved very active on both ends of the glass.  “In eight straight contests, [Bridges] has logged no less than 38 minutes,” Monique explains. “If he continues his intensity and the Mavericks continue to struggle, I believe he’ll have plenty of opportunities to clear this number.” Bettors can find Bridges’ rebounding prop around +115 if they choose to back it at four-and-a-half.
