Stargazers can watch the moon turn an eerie blood red color during a rare lunar eclipse Sunday night — with New Yorkers catching a glimpse starting at around 11:30 p.m., according to NASA. The celestial spectacle will kick off at around 10:28 p.m. on the east coast, when the moon enters the Earth’s central shadow, known as the umbra, according to the Wall Street Journal. At that point, skywatchers can behold the orb appearing as if a chunk is missing — and the crimson-colored cosmic event will be visible about an hour later. The moon will appear bathed in a copper-red glow reflected from the Earth’s sunset during the longest lunar eclipse, which is the longest in a decade at roughly 1 1/2 hours. “It’s going to be a fun show,” Noah Petro, a scientist with NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission told the outlet. All you need are “patience and eyeballs,” he said. At its peak, the moon will be 225,000 miles from Earth at around midnight and remain the reddish color until after 1 a.m. When the moon leaves the umbra at around 1:55 a.m., it will regain its pearly white color. The lunar wonder will be visible to much of the world, including all of North and South America. The total eclipse occurs when Earth passes directly between the moon and the sun, and casts a shadow on the moon. There will be another lengthy total lunar eclipse in November, visible from Africa and Europe. The next one isn’t until 2025. With Post wires
