The Yankees are officially without a key piece of their bullpen, and could be for a while. The club placed Chad Green on the 15-day injured list Saturday with what it called a “right elbow strain.” While Green was still gathering more opinions from doctors as of Saturday morning, manager Aaron Boone said surgery was on the table. “It looks like a significant injury,” Boone said, adding that there might be more clarity later on Saturday after the Yankees host the White Sox. Boone said Green, who exited Thursday’s game in Baltimore with forearm discomfort, was handling the injury as well as could be expected. “It was pretty emotional for me, honestly,” Boone said. “A lot that’s right about our sport is Chad Green, just in the way he prepares, how he takes care of himself, the professional that he is, the respect he carries in that room, the track record of consistent success. So it’s difficult.” Ron Marinaccio was called up from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take Green’s spot on the roster. Entering Saturday, the 30-year-old Green had a 3.00 ERA across 15 innings this season. He has been one of the Yankees’ top high-leverage options in front of closer Aroldis Chapman, along with Clay Holmes, Michael King and Jonathan Loaisiga.
