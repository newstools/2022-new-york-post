Matt Harvey won’t be pitching in the major leagues for at least a little bit longer after he was suspended by the Commissioner’s Office on Tuesday for distributing a “drug of abuse.” The right-hander, who is currently signed with the Orioles on a minor league deal, was hit with a 60-game ban for violating the joint drug program between MLB and the MLB Players Association. The suspension is retroactive to April 29. The former Mets ace admitted to providing opioids — a banned substance — to Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who died of an overdose in 2019, during his testimony in the federal trial of the team’s former communications director, Eric Kay, in February. The 33-year-old Harvey said during his testimony that he provided Skaggs with six or seven Percocets in the clubhouse during the season, but that Kay was Skaggs’ regular source. Harvey also admitted to using cocaine during his career and said the Mets never asked him about it during his time in Queens. Harvey was reportedly given federal immunity for his testimony after being subpoenaed. Kay, who was accused of distributing oxycodone pills containing fentanyl that led to Skaggs’ death, was convicted on one count each of drug distribution resulting in death and drug conspiracy. Harvey, who spent six-plus seasons with the Mets, last pitched in the majors for the Orioles in 2021, when he went 6-14 with a 6.27 ERA — his best since 2018. Once dubbed the Dark Knight during his dominant years with the Mets, his career has been on shaky ground and he has never regained his All-Star form since he was traded to the Reds in 2018 after his return from thoracic outlet syndrome.
