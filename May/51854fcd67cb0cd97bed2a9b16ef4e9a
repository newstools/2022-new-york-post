Burgers are a classic favorite for many people — but it turns out we may have been eating them wrong all this time. TGI Fridays — who have now rebranded as Fridays — made the extraordinary claim that we should be eating them upside down for a very good reason. As part of their Flip It Challenge, they stated their unusual method has its benefits. On their Instagram account, the restaurant explained: “According to our experts, the best way to eat a burger is to flip it upside down. “The thicker top bun soaks up the burger juices, helping keep that flavor in for longer.” A Fridays burger expert added further explanation, and said: “The reason that many say a burger tastes better when eaten ‘upside down’ is that the top bun is thicker. “So, flipping your burger means that there is more bread underneath to absorb the juices and flavors from the burger and toppings as you bite into it. “It also means that your tongue meets the toppings first and the burger second. “Whether that tastes better to you is down to personal preference — so give it a try and let us know what you find!” The method may be new to some, but some burger fans have been trying to spread the word for years. In 2018, Simon Dukes, who is the founder of blog Burger Lad, told Insider why the “top thicker bun” should go underneath. He said: “Burgers are served the way they are purely for aesthetics. “The crown (the top of the bun) is generally thicker (and therefore stronger) than the heel, so for a better eating experience, you should actually flip it upside down to eat it. “The crown will then hold the weight of everything else, and there is less likelihood of it falling apart in your hands. “A true burger connoisseur should always eat their burgers upside down.” Will you be trying this next time you tuck into a burger? Fridays is adamant it’ll make for a “much easier eating experience.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
