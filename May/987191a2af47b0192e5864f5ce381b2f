From the concert stage to the stage at Studio 8H. Selena Gomez and Post Malone are both appearing on the May 14 episode of “Saturday Night Live” and may have caused a little trouble in the green room. The “Only Murders in the Building” star, 29, and the “Rockstar” singer, 26, appeared in a promo for the show alongside cast members Bowen Yang and Aidy Bryant, who labeled them both “divas.” Gomez is hosting the show for the first time ever in her career and Post is making his “SNL” debut as the episode’s musical guest. Bryant, 35, quipped at how there were “two pop stars and two comedy actors” on the show this week. Cue the crickets. “I’m actually also an actor,” Gomez noted, while Malone chimed in: “And I’m not really a pop star!” “Oh, OK, well I didn’t know you all were a bunch of divas!” Bryant exaggeratedly said. Yang, 31, then tried to tease the “Love You Like a Love Song” crooner. “Selena, first time hosting,” he said in the promo. “You nervous? You got ants in your pants?” “No, I’m just excited,” she replied back. “Are you sure?” Bryant asked. Malone then jokingly agrees that she should check her pants before hosting the show. Yang, Bryant and Malone then amusingly just happened to mention that they spilled jelly as well as an ant farm on her pants and left them out for three days. “SORRY!” the three say in unison as Gomez’s face playfully dropped into a worried frown and she looked down at her trousers. There was more good news for the “Congratulations” singer this month when it was announced that he was expecting his first child with his longtime girlfriend. “I’m excited for this next chapter in my life. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, and for since I could remember I was sad,” the rapper told TMZ on May 3. “Time to take care of my body and my family and friends, and spread as much love as we can every day,” he added.
