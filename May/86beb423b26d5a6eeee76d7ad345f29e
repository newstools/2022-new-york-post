A fire at a New Jersey trash facility prompted evacuation of homes and left one person unaccounted for, authorities said. Officials in Elizabeth said the blaze at Waste Management’s Julia Street transfer station was reported at about 2 p.m. Tuesday. City public information officer Ruby Contreras said surrounding homes were evacuated and while no injuries had been reported, there was one person who had not been accounted for. Contreras said the blaze may have been sparked by machinery at the site, and it was expected to be “ongoing well through the night.” The fire was burning south of Newark Liberty International Airport, but airport operations were not impacted, according to the airport’s Twitter account, NJ.com reported.
