A towering Jesus statue in a small Brazilian town just usurped Rio de Janiero’s famed Christ the Redeemer. Rio Grande du Sol, population 22,880, now boasts a statue called “Christ the Protector,’’ which is more than 140 feet tall — well higher than Rio’s 98-foot Redeemer. The most notable feature of the new statue — which was completed April 22 — is an elevator leading to a heart-shaped lookout point at 112 feet. “It will be a glass opening from where people will be able to film and photograph the valley,” said head project supervisor Artur Lopes de Souza to the Web site of the Friends of Christ Association that funded the statue. The statue cost $350,000 to erect. Despite the towering statue’s location 975 miles from Brazil’s massive famous city of Rio, Rio Grande du Sol officials have high expectations for their attraction — especially after they finish building a tourist complex at the statue’s base featuring shops, restaurants and viewing points. Still, even while it beats out Rio’s legendary statue, Christ the protector is not the world’s tallest. With a 90-foot wingspan, it is the third highest Jesus statue in the world, trumped by the Jesu Buntu Burake in Indonesia and Christ the King in Poland, which are both more than 172 feet tall.
