The NYPD released subway surveillance video of a knife-wielding man who allegedly threatened straphangers over the weekend – telling one rider, “I’ll take your head off your f—–g neck!” The frightening incident unfolded around 3:30 p.m. Sunday on a southbound No. 6 subway in the East 77th Street and Lexington Avenue station on the Upper East Side, cops said. The armed suspect followed a 35-year-old into the crowded car and became irate as the train left the station, holding a switchblade in plain view, cops said. “I’m not riding this train pressed up against this door,” the man with the knife yelled, as he repeatedly flicked the blade in and out in the victim’s direction. “I’ll take your head off your f—–g neck.” When the southbound train arrived at the 68th Street/Lexington Avenue subway station, the suspect fled. There were no injuries reported and the investigation remains ongoing. Surveillance video shows the knife-wielding maniac entering the transit system at the 59th Street and Lexington Avenue subway by jumping over the turnstile.
