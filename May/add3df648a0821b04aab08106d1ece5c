With the series tied at two games apiece, the Celtics and Heat travel back to Miami for a pivotal Game Five. But before the action gets underway, Brandon Anderson of The Action Network is here to present his best bet for the contest (video above). Rather than looking to either side for the full game, Anderson is instead targeting a team total. For his pick Wednesday, Anderson likes the Boston Celtics over 102.5 points, which comes in at -125 on PointsBet Sportsbook. For Anderson, that number is too low on a Boston offense that has proven reliable this series. “The Celtics have gone over that number in three of four games this series,” Anderson says. Plus, the only under so far came in Game Four where Boston scored 102 points and lost on the hook. Further, the C’s are averaging 110 points per game for the series, a number that ticks up to 117 through two road contests. Extrapolate the data back further and bettors will find Boston has cleared this team total in 12 of 15 playoff games to date. Anderson also details that, if you trust the line and believe the Celtics win as favorites, it has a strong chance of clearing this total. In all but one of its wins, the Celtics have scored at least 108 points, with the lone discrepancy coming in its most recent win.  Even if the Celtics lose the game outright, Anderson still gives it a coin-flip chance of surpassing its team total. For those reasons, take the over on the Celtics team total.
