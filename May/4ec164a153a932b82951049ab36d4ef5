Mick Schumacher suffered a horrific crash as his car broke in half during the Monaco Grand Prix. The 23-year-old German lost control of his car on lap 27 of the Monte Carlo race. And as he spun around he clipped the barriers before shunting the car into the wall and splitting it in half. Schumacher walked away from the incident without any serious injuries, but the race was still red flagged after attempts to clear the debris with a yellow flag were unsuccessful. Schumacher’s team Haas confirmed that he was OK with a short tweet. The post read: “Mick has a really big accident at the Swimming Pool Chicane. “He’s out of the car and ok.” The incident was Schumacher’s second high-speed crash of the season after he also suffered a big one in Saudi Arabia. And this time it meant the end of Haas’ Monaco GP hopes as their other driver Kevin Magnussen had already retired from the race. It came after the race had been delayed by more than an hour due to heavy rain causing safety concerns. Formula One’s flagship race was due to get underway at 2 p.m. BST on Sunday afternoon. But, with bad weather leading to safety concerns just moments before the cars were set to get going, the FIA decided to suspend the race. It was then confirmed that the formation lap would get underway at 2:16 p.m., 16 minutes later than scheduled. But after a couple of formation laps behind the safety car, a red flag was waved and all of the drivers returned to the pits. There was then a lengthy wait before the race got going behind the safety car shortly after 3 p.m. — over an hour later than originally planned.
