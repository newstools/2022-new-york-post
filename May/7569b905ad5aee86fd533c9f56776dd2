There’s been swift resolution to the viral video that emerged of Suns point guard Chris Paul yelling at Mavericks fans he accused of pushing his mother and wife. On Monday, the Mavericks said said in a statement that two fans attempted to give “unwanted hugs” to members of Paul’s family, and have been banned from the American Airlines Center for more than a year and a half. “Two unruly fans attempted to give unwanted hugs and have conversations with members of the Paul family on the public concourse of the American Airlines Center,” the Mavericks said in a statement. “AAC security responded immediately once notified by the family and the fans were swiftly ejected from the game. The fans involved in the incident will not be allowed to return to the arena until 2023.” After the incident, an incredulous Paul tweeted, “Wanna fine players for saying stuff to the fans but the fans can put they hands on our families….f–k that!!” Since the return of fans to stadiums and arenas amid the pandemic, it anecdotally seems like there have been more incidents of unruly fans — whether it be fights in the stands, incidents with players or even animal rights protesters gluing themselves to the court. The Suns and Mavericks are tied in the Western Conference semifinals at two games apiece; Game 5 is in Phoenix on Tuesday night.
