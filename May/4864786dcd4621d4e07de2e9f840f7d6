A spectacular Miami Beach compound is hitting the market for $170 million, the highest price ever sought in the storied history of Florida real estate. Located in hyper-exclusive La Gorce Island, the property consists of four separate parcels and three homes spread over three oceanfront acres, according to Coldwell Banker agents Jill Eber and Jill Hertzberg. “This is a prized, trophy compound that most discerning buyers have been waiting for years to come onto the market,” Eber said in a release. Noted doctor, businessman and philanthropist M. Lee Pearce paid $3.1 million for four adjoining properties in the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal. Pearce, who lived on the estate for several decades, later purchased additional contiguous parcels to create the luxurious expanse that exists today. The new listing includes a 5,000-bottle wine storage area, a theater and a conference center. But the agents said the compound’s “crown jewel” is a private park called the “Domaine de la Paix et de l’Amour” that features a marble gazebo, sprawling gardens and bay views. Hertzberg told The Journal that the unprecedented price tag reflects the unusually large size of the lot for the area and the potential for a subdivision in one of Miami Beach’s most exquisite enclaves. She also noted that the property boasts 600 feet of water frontage that can host a yacht. La Gorce Island, which hosts only 60 homes, has become coveted territory for the superrich due its privacy, security and scenic marine vistas. Proceeds from what is expected to be a mammoth final sale will go to Pearce’s foundation and its support of medical research and the arts, according to The Journal.
