Authorities hunting for escaped convict Casey Cole White and former jail boss Vicky White have reportedly discovered a vehicle in Indiana they believe is connected to the pair’s disappearance. The US Marshals Service and authorities in Evansville are investigating whether the vehicle is the one that was reported stolen from the area in Tennessee where the duo ditched a 2007 Ford Edge, a law enforcement source told WAAY on Monday. Vicky bought the Ford Edge before she and Casey allegedly fled the Lauderdale County jail in Alabama on April 29, police said. But after the alleged escape, she ditched their original vehicle in College Grove, Tenn., about two hours north of the lockup, police said. “Because it was abandoned so quickly, they probably had mechanical problems with it. It was abandoned pretty much in the middle of nowhere on the side of a country road where it would obviously draw attention and be found,” Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Friday. Singleton previously told The Post the Ford was their primary lead and once they learned the car had been ditched, they’d be back to square one. Chad Hunt, commander of the US Marshals’ Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force, has told The Post they “know” the pair headed north to Tennessee “for a specific reason.” Hunt told WAAY that Vicky may be getting help while on the lam from former inmates whom she had treated “above par.” “They had a lot of respect for her. Some of the things that we have to account [for] and sit back and look at is 17 years’ worth of contact with other inmates that are potentially out now,” he told the outlet. Casey’s former lawyer, Dale Bryant, has said he fears the escaped suspect might attempt suicide by cop because he suffers from severe mental illness and addiction issues.
