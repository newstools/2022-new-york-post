A tough-as-nails gunshot victim refused to back down during an argument in the Bronx — even after taking a bullet to the foot, newly released video shows. The surveillance clip shows the two men arguing outside 140 West Fordham Road in University Heights just before 3:15 a.m. Monday, according to cops. One of the men, sporting an Allan Iverson 76ers jersey, is seen pulling a gun and firing off a round, striking the 28-year-old man in the foot. The victim briefly stops in pain but then walks it off, leaving a trail of bloody footsteps as he limps toward the armed man, still arguing. Cops said the dispute started in Fokkus Room & Cucine nearby and continued out onto the street. The unknown gunman took off in a white sedan, cops said. The victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital by private means. No arrests have been made.
