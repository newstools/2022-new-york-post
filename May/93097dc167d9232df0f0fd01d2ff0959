Those looking to cruise the seas with the greatest of ease have a new option in their midst — one with rare celebrity pedigree. A mega-yacht that once belonged to the late glam rock icon David Bowie is going up for sale, asking $5.17 million (sans spiders from Mars). The vessel dates to 1977 — and Bowie owned it throughout the 1980s, according to his rep and longtime friend, Bill Zysblat. Bowie, who passed away in 2016, famously had a fear of flying — admitting in an interview that his phobia led to several hit songs, including  “Space Oddity.” “It allows me to just write about space as opposed to going into it,” he said in a 2002 interview with “60 Minutes.” Instead, he traveled across the seas from country to county on the yacht while touring. When he finally overcame that fear, he sold the yacht in the late ’80s. It has since had two different owners. The yacht has been used actively during its own lifetime, sailing throughout the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. First known as Deneb Star, it later changed its name to El Caran. The six-stateroom boat was recently rented for $85,000 per week. It was refitted in 2020 with some newer upgrades to include a fresh paint job and a new teak deck. It was designed and built by Italian boatbuilding company, Benetti. The interior of the yacht features a mahogany finish with paintings and art installations. It can accommodate up to 12 guests with over six cabins — including a master suite, two VIP staterooms, one double cabin and two twin cabins. Giulio Riggio at Fraser’s Palma office holds the listing. Since the singer’s death in 2016, sever other items previously belonging to him have come up for sale, which includes 400 artworks auctioned off from his personal collection (including pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Ettore Sottsass). Meanwhile, his longtime New York City apartment he shared with his wife, supermodel Iman, sold last summer for $16.5 million after nearly five years on the market.
