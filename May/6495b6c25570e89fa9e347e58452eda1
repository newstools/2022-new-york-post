While Oscar-nominated actress Minnie Driver has been busy recording her podcast, “Minnie Questions,” starring in the new “Romeo and Juliet”-inspired “Rosaline” (out on Hulu this summer) and writing the just-released memoir “Managing Expectations,” her favorite role remains that of mother to son Henry, 13. “The best part of being a mom is seeing this baby grow into a kind, funny, thoughtful human and being present for every step of that evolution,” she tells Alexa. And he’s already a gift-giving pro: At 7, he gave her “a jar filled with thoughts he had about me being his mother, jokes and advice. I’m pretty sure it will be on my bedside table forever,” says Driver, 52. No Mother’s Day present could top that, but these colorful statement pieces — hand-picked by the Irish actress — might make a close second.
