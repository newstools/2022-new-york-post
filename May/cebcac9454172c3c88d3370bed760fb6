Wall Street roared back from the precipice of a bear market on Monday after a sluggish two months which saw the major indexes fall for seven consecutive weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 618.34 points, or 2%, to 31,880.24. Meanwhile, the tech-dominated Nasdaq rose 180 points, or 1.6%, to 11,525.27. The S&P 500, which briefly entered bear market territory on Friday after falling off more than 20% from its record high, gained 1.9%, or 72 points. Banks made strong gains along with rising bond yields, which they rely on to charge more lucrative interest on loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.83% from 2.77% late Friday. Bank of America rose 5.6%. Technology stocks also did some heavy lifting. Apple rose 4% and Microsoft rose 3.2%. The sector has been choppy over the last few weeks and has prompted many of the market’s recent big swings. VMware surged 25% following a report that chipmaker Broadcom is offering to buy the cloud-computing company. Retailers and other companies that rely on direct consumer spending slipped. Target slipped 0.9% and Home Depot fell 0.3%. A series of disappointing earnings reports from key retailers last week raised concerns that consumers are tempering spending on a wide range of goods as they get squeezed by rising inflation. Lingering concerns about inflation have been weighing on the market and have kept major indexes in a slump. The benchmark S&P 500 is so far experiencing its longest weekly losing streak since the dot-com bubble was deflating in 2001. It came close to falling 20% from its peak earlier this year, which would put the index at the heart of most workers’ 401(k) accounts into a bear market. With Post wires
