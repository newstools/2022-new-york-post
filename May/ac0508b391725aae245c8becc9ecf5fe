The Queens woman who was crushed between parked cars in a horror hit-and-run crash on Mother’s Day died early Monday, her family told The Post. Florence Ngwu, 49, who was pinned in front of her daughter in South Jamaica early Sunday when an out-of-control stolen truck slammed into a car, died after her heart stopped beating while treated in Jamaica Hospital, a niece said. “This is the third time and they weren’t able to revive her,” said the 29-year-old niece, who asked to be identified as Nnenna B, on Monday. “We’re all just devastated,” she told The Post, saying the family was “in shock, grief — everything seems surreal.” The Mother’s Day horror came around 8:30 a.m. when a Ford F-550 slammed into a car while doing a U-turn at 167th Street and 120th Avenue, pinning the nurse as her daughter screamed in horror. “Mommy! Mommy!,” the daughter screamed in footage obtained by The Post as her mom remained unconscious. Doctors had warned the family that she might not survive the injuries, the niece previously told The Post. She called the truck driver who fled the now-deadly crash — and was still being hunted Monday — “just so inhumane.” The NYPD confirmed Monday that there had been no arrests.
