The New York State Senate Transportation Committee will convene Thursday to hear from and vote on the confirmations of six new members of the MTA board. Mayor Eric Adams has nominated Isabel Midori, Valdivia Espino, Frankie Miranda and Sherif Soliman to serve in three of his the city’s four board positions, according to state Sen. Tim Kennedy (D-Buffalo). Gov. Kathy Hochul, for her part, has tapped Lisa Sorin as one of her board reps and Samuel Chu and Blanca Lopez to represent Suffolk County and Westchester County, respectively. Hochul effectively controls the board through her appointees, who account for a majority of the body. The city has just four representatives, despite accounting for the vast majority of riders. Valdivia Espino previously served as chief of staff to MTA chairmen Joe Lhota and Pat Foye, as well as in positions at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. She has been chief operating officer of Coro New York Leadership Center since January. Frankie Miranda, meanwhile, serves as the president of the Hispanic Federation, and Sherif Soliman is a longtime city official who served in leadership roles under both Adams and his predecessor Bill de Blasio. State senators will hear virtual testimony starting at noon on Thursday from the nominees, who cannot take their board seats without senate approval.
