A Long Island DJ who recorded himself smoking pot while storming the Capitol on Jan. 6 was sentenced to three years and five months in prison Thursday. Greg Rubenacker, 26, in February pleaded guilty to all 10 charges he faced – including civil disorder and committing an act of physical violence on Capitol grounds – for his part in the insurrection. At a hearing in Washington, DC, federal court, Chief Judge Beryl Howell sentenced the Farmingdale man to 41 months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release and a $2,000 fine in restitution, prosecutors announced. During the riot, Rubenacker recorded videos on Snapchat including one video of himself puffing on a marijuana joint while declaring, “Smoke out the Capitol, baby,” prosecutors said. “This is history! We took the Capitol,” he proudly stated in another. When Rubenacker was in the Capitol Building Rotunda, he lit up the joint and later resisted officers who were trying to force the rioters from the area, officials say. Rubenacker swung a plastic water bottle at one officer’s head and then sprayed water from the bottle onto cops before he was pepper-sprayed alongside the other rioters, authorities said. He was arrested three days later on Jan. 9. Rubenacker’s lawyer, Michael Matera, told The Post by phone,  “We are disappointed in the sentence that Mr. Rubenacker received today and look forward to pursing any appeals that he may have.”
