DENVER — Nothing quite says “winter” like the Mets traveling to Colorado. The Mets-Rockies game scheduled for Friday night at Coors Field was postponed by snow, the second straight year that has occurred. The teams are scheduled to play a split doubleheader on Saturday, with the first game at 3:10 p.m. Eastern and the nightcap at 8:40 p.m. EDT. Last season, the Mets’ scheduled April 16 game at Colorado was postponed by snow and the teams played a doubleheader the following day. The Mets also had two games in Colorado snowed out in April 2013, forcing a doubleheader and return to Coors Field later in the season. The forecast for Saturday calls for snow to end in the morning, with temperatures for first pitch at 43 degrees. Carlos Carrasco is scheduled to start Game 1 of the doubleheader, with Trevor Williams slated for the nightcap. Williams will be working on short rest — he pitched four shutout innings in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Cardinals on Tuesday — but the Mets may prefer to pitch right-handers against the Rockies, who are among MLB’s best teams against lefties this season. That means left-hander David Peterson, who is expected to be activated from the taxi squad, likely won’t pitch before the Mets play at San Francisco starting Monday. Taijuan Walker is expected to pitch on normal rest Sunday. The Mets are a season-high 12 games above .500. The last time they were at that level was Oct. 2, 2016, when they completed an 87-65 season. Brandon Nimmo, who grew up a Rockies fan in Cheyenne, Wyo. (about two hours from Denver), has a .364/.404/.636 slash line with four homers and 10 RBIs in 11 career games at Coors Field, where he also has a 10-game hitting streak. Pete Alonso began Friday as the MLB leader in RBIs with 36, after driving in seven runs over his last two games. In 18 games this month Alonso is batting .309/.397/.618 with 13 runs, three doubles, six home runs, 19 RBI and nine walks.
