Looking for a West Coast perch? This rock and roll beach house in secretive, under-the-radar Bolinas in Northern California comes with its own guitar-shaped pool. The oceanfront Marin County home at 99 Brighton Ave. has served as a sanctuary for multiple rock royals over the years. It’s now on the market for $16 million. This is where Jerry Garcia and Grace Slick rocked out back in the day. Slick even designed the guitar-shaped pool with gold and copper mosaics and tiles with sun and moon motifs. Bolinas is just an hour north of San Francisco and an hour southwest of Sonoma. It’s where Star Wars producer George Lucas created Skywalker Ranch. Built in 1920, the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is 4,074 square feet and comes with 300 feet of beachfront — all on seven-tenths of an acre. Over the years, the home has served as a bathhouse, tea house, casino and ballroom. The family of philanthropist/entrepreneur Susie Tompkins Buell — co-founder of Esprit de Corp and the North Face — owned it in the 1960s. Buell has said the home helped instill her love for nature and inspired her environmental activism. The home opens with a stone archway with keystone work by artisan Doug Bryant, of A Lost Art Stonework. The main living area has a fireplace and cathedral ceilings with exposed wooden beams, wood paneling and hardwood floors — and opens to multi-level limestone patios. There’s also an open dining area and a chef’s kitchen while the basement boasts a media room, wet bar and sauna. Art on the property includes a bronze dolphin by late sculptor Peter Bishop Allen, which appears to be rising from the water. The listing broker is Aalto, an online real estate marketplace.
