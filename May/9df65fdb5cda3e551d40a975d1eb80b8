The body of a missing 33-year-old British mom Katie Kenyon was discovered by police in a forest, police confirmed on Sunday. The mother-of-two was found in the sprawling moorland of the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire in the northwest of England Friday night. A postmortem examination said that she had died as a result of head injuries, Lancashire police said. A man was charged in connection with her killing last week. “Following extensive police enquiries and after a number of days of searching I can now sadly confirm that we have found a body and at this time we believe it to be that of Katie Kenyon,” Detective Superintendent Gary Brooks, head of Lancashire’s Force Major Investigation Unit, said in a statement. “Katie’s family have been told and my heart goes out to them at this time. We have specially trained officers supporting them at this difficult time.” Kenyon was last seen on April 22 around 9:30 a.m. when police believed she traveled in a Ford Transit van towards Bolton by Lowland areas with a man. She was reported missing on April 24. On Wednesday, Andrew Burfield, 50, of Burnley, was arrested and charged with her murder. He appeared in court on Friday, but did not speak except to identify himself, the Guardian reported. He is scheduled to stand trial in November, cops said. “While this is not the conclusion to those searches any of us would have wished for I know the family appreciates those efforts,” Brooks said.
