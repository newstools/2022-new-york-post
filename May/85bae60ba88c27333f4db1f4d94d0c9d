This crib can shred. A rural Washington state house has gone viral for its unique amenity: An in-house skate park. “It’s a legend,” listing agent Adam Drain of BHHS Leavenworth Properties told The Post of the over 4,000-square-foot lodge, which is currently asking for $729,000. Located in the Pacific Northwest’s Stevens Pass ski area, the home features a “pro-style indoor skate bowl” which has made it well known in the professional skateboarding community. In its time, the five-bedroom, three-bathroom has “hosted industry video premieres, remains the canvas for authentic murals” and is sold furnished with its gnarly skate setup, Drain said. The home is setup so that the skate area currently divides the home’s two living units. In addition to the tricked out skate gym, the home is situated on more than five acres “of adventure” bordering US Forest Service land. The acreage includes a private ski hill, mountain bike run and pump track. When it comes time to relax, a covered deck and bridge lead to a hot tub which overlooks a landscaped fire pit. Other indoor amenities include an ironwork accented chef’s kitchen in the chalet unit, a fireplace in the garden suite, and a loft with “bunk room” accessed via a catwalk, according to the listing. The home’s style is currently “Not your HGTVs mid-century modern” Drain noted. The home is located a 20-minute drive from the town of Leavenworth and Stevens Pass. “The skate park was a nice McTwist,” commented one fan of the home on the Instagram page Zillow Gone Wild’s post of it “I kinda love when I see an adult make their childhood dream come true!” wrote another. “Contractor: ‘What can I do for you.’ Customer:’“DO YOU EVEN SKATE BRO?’ Contractor: ‘Say no more I gotchu,’” commented a third, imagining the dialogue which led to the home’s skate park.
