Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford are the newest additions to the “Yellowstone” universe. The actors will appear in the upcoming Paramount+ series that currently has the working title “1932,” The Wrap reported. The streaming network also tweeted the news on Tuesday. The series will introduce a new generation of the Dutton family, according to a press release from the streaming service obtained by the site. “It’s set to explore the early 20th century when pandemics, historic drought, the end of Prohibition and the Great Depression all plague the mountain West and the Duttons who call it home,” the streamer said in the release. No further information was released about the characters Mirren, 76, and Ford, 79, will portray. The show will premiere in December. This will be Ford’s first scripted TV series since his cameo in a 1993 episode of ABC’s “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.” Ford got his start in the 1960s TV series “The Virginian” and “Mod Squad” but has never had a regular TV gig. Mirren, on the other hand, rose to fame on the British TV series “Prime Suspect” in 1991. She also won Primetime Emmys for her role in the TV movie “The Passion of Ayn Rand” and the miniseries “Elizabeth I.” The new prequel comes after Tim McGraw and Faith Hill starred in the one-off prequel “1883” in February. Meanwhile, “Yellowstone” recently started production on Season 5 in Montana, Deadline reported. The Taylor Sheridan drama averaged 11 million views in its fourth season and was nominated for a SAG and PGA award.
