A man was killed and two apparent innocent bystanders were hurt — one critically — when a gunman opened fire inside a Bronx store early Tuesday, cops said. The suspect chased his 31-year-old target into the store on East Burnside Avenue near Grand Concourse in Mount Hope around 12:50 a.m. — and wildly opened fire, striking him in the head and upper torso area, according to cops and police sources. The victim, whose identity has not been released pending family notification, was pronounced dead on scene, authorities said. Two other people inside the store — a man and woman, both 34 — were struck in the fray and were not believed to be the intended targets, according to police. The man was shot in the left arm and the woman in the torso, cops said. Both were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where the woman is listed in critical condition and the man in stable condition, according to police. A person of interest was taken into custody, but no charges were immediately filed, police said. The violence came on the first night that the NYPD deployed additional night patrols to help stem gun crime — part of the first phase of Mayor Eric Adams’ summer violence prevention plan. The additional patrols are meant to boost the department’s coverage between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m., when “nearly half our shootings are happening,” NYPD Chief of Department Ken Corey said last week.
