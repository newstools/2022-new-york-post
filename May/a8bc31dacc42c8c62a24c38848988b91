The panther first leapt into Cartier history in 1914 — courtesy of a watch adorned with onyx and diamond “spots,” designed by Louis Cartier himself. More than a century later, it remains a symbol of the storied jeweler, prowling through its most iconic pieces (from bracelets and brooches to cigarette cases and handbags), often cloaked with rare stones. The emblem served as a badge of audacity for Cartier’s trailblazing designer Jeanne Toussaint, who created dimensional feline pieces that dazzled on her clients, a symbol of their own power and ferocity. Devotees have included everyone from Duchess of Windsor Wallis Simpson in the 1940s to Timothée Chalamet, who dangled a glimmering Panthère de Cartier diamond-and-emerald pendant from his bare chest at this year’s Oscars. The collection’s latest offering — a stunning golden necklace studded with diamonds and green tsavorite garnets for eyes — proves that the legend of Cartier’s iconic panther roars on.
