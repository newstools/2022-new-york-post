The former head of one of the city’s biggest homeless shelter operators will spend two years in jail following his conviction for taking more than $1 million in bribes. Victor Rivera was sentenced to 27 months in prison by Manhattan federal Judge Sidney Stein on Monday for taking $1.2 million in kickbacks from contractors hired by his non-profit, the Bronx Parent Housing Network. Stein also ordered that Rivera pay $902,000 in restitution to his former non-profit. His indictment in March 2021 came after The New York Times revealed allegations of misconduct that stretched well beyond stealing money from New York’s neediest. Nearly a dozen women placed into Bronx Parent Housing Network shelters alleged that Rivera had sexually harassed or assaulted them, the report said. Those allegations were not included in the charges brought by the feds or city officials.
