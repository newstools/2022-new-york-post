The Marlins and Nationals begin a three-game series Friday and Jules Posner of The Action Network is here to share his best bet for the opener (video above). Miami, which will send Sandy Alcantara to the mound Monday, arrives as a heavy home favorite and Posner believes that designation is justified. At the time of writing, Caesars Sportsbook has the total set at 8 runs. Although it hasn’t risen up to his normal standard, Alcantara has pitched solidly at home for the Marlins. “So far in 2022, [Alcantara] has posted a 3.15 ERA with a 3.92 FIP and 3.91 xFIP,” Posner details. Additionally, the Marlins’ offense has proven fairly reliable at home. To date, it holds the seventh-best home wRC+ number in Major League Baseball against right-handed pitchers. Although the Nationals are the best wRC+ road offense over the last few weeks, Posner believes there are concerns to be had with its starting pitcher for Monday — Aaron Sanchez. “So far this season on the road, [Sanchez] has an 8.68 ERA, a 5.16 FIP, and a 3.68 xFIP,” Posner says. Considering those struggles for Sanchez, Posner believes a strong Miami offense will have its way at home. As a result, he’s choosing to back the Marlins run-line and believes it’s worth a shot so long as it’s available at +100 or better.  Even if it’s not available in plus-money, Posner would play the Marlins run-line all the way up to -120. At the time of publishing, the Marlins are +112 on FanDuel Sportsbook to win by more than 1.5 runs.
