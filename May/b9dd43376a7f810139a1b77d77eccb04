A 2-year-old girl was allegedly shot and killed by her own uncle during a family argument in a Maine resort town, reports said Sunday. Octavia Jean Huber-Young was killed when her uncle Andrew Huber-Young opened fire during the fight in Wells. Two other men were injured in the shooting, the Portland Press Herald said. Andrew Huber-Young, 19, was taken into custody and charged with murder, Maine State Police said, with more charges expected to stem from the triple shooting. The young girl was rushed to the hospital Saturday afternoon where she later succumbed to her injuries, according to authorities. An autopsy is expected to be performed in the coming days. An uncle of the young victim, Craig Higgins, said the two injured men are Octavia’s father and grandfather. Andrew Huber-Young is the brother of Octavia’s father, Ethan Huber-Young, according to the Portland Press Herald. Higgins said in a Facebook post “a piece of me died with (Octavia) today.” “I am so angry at the world, God himself even. Why did God have to take our precious little Octavia. I just don’t understand why someone would get angry and turn that anger into violence and shoot an innocent little 2 year old girl,” Higgins said in the post. “Octavia was such a precious little girl.” Higgins said Andrew was kicked out of the house. He left but later returned and started shooting, hitting Ethan twice while he was holding his daughter. Samantha Higgins told WGME CBS 13 that her daughter was full of life. “When she wanted my attention, she would always grab my finger and bring me toward her room and play with her. And she always loved to go outside and play on her swing set,” Samantha Higgins told the TV station. Maine authorities would not confirm what the relationship was between the alleged shooter and the three victims in a press release Sunday.
