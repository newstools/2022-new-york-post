Thanks, but no thanks. Juwan Howard, the former longtime NBA player who now coaches at his alma mater Michigan, recently declined an opportunity to get involved in the Lakers’ head-coaching search, ESPN reported. The Lakers, coming off a brutal 33-49 season in which they missed the playoffs, are currently down to a final three of former Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, Bucks assistant coach Darvin Ham and one-time Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts. In-person interviews are expected to happen in the near future. Howard played with Lakers star LeBron James and knew general manager Rob Pelinka well from his playing days. But leaving Michigan was seen as a long shot, particularly because Howard wants to coach his two sons, Jace and Jett, a junior and freshman, respectively. Prior to taking the job at Michigan in 2019, Howard interviewed for the Lakers opening that ultimately went to Frank Vogel, who was fired last month. At the time, he was an assistant coach with the Heat, his job for six seasons. Howard has compiled a 93-61 record in three seasons at Michigan and was the National Coach of the Year in 2021. He has guided the Wolverines to two NCAA Tournament berths and a Big Ten regular-season crown. He was suspended for the final games of this past regular season and fined $40,000 after hitting a Wisconsin assistant coach in the head as part of a postgame melee.
