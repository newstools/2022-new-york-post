After “dying to go” to the Met Gala “for years,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams finally got his wish. Adams, 61, arrived on the red carpet wearing a statement suit, making a political splash on the red carpet alongside girlfriend Tracey Collins. He donned a coat with decorative forearms and lapels that paid homage to the MTA in addition to the back of his coat, which read “END GUN VIOLENCE” in bold red letters. Adams’ move to make a political statement on the red carpet follows Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who wore a gown last year that read “TAX THE RICH.” His look was also complete with a fresh pedicure, which he debuted on Twitter. His Monday appointment confirmed his appearance on one of celebrity fashion’s biggest nights after some speculation. Known for his keen sense of fashion, Adams has kept up his style while serving as mayor, most notably his custom suits from the high-end Mohan Custom Tailors, which ring in at $2,000 apiece. And he’s no stranger to the fashion-forward life, having attended New York Fashion Week in February — seated next to Anna Wintour, no less. He’s also chummy with Naomi Campbell and Jon Batiste, and has been pictured with Cara Delevingne and A$AP Rocky. Despite the life of seeming glitz, glamor and luxury, lawyer and lobbyist Brad Gerstman, who listed Adams on his Best Dressed Politicians roundup, said the mayor isn’t allowed to accept clothes for free or discounted — including for the Met Gala. Known now as the mayor of nightlife in the Big Apple, the Met Gala won’t be his first rodeo — and probably not his last — after appearing at other star-studded events, such as the opening night of “The Music Man” on Broadway earlier this year.
