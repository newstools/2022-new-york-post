Here we go again. For the fifth time in the span of a couple weeks, the Rangers’ season is on the line. And for the second straight playoff series, it will come down to a Game 7. If the Rangers can make it past the Hurricanes on Memorial Day in Raleigh, N.C., the Lightning await in the Eastern Conference final. After a Game 6 in which the Rangers played their best 60 minutes of the second round, the momentum is with them, though that has meant nothing thus far in a series in which the home team has won every match. “I think the key [to Game 7] is probably to try and play like today,” Artemi Panarin said through a translator following Game 6, pointing out the obvious. “We have to play a very disciplined game.”
