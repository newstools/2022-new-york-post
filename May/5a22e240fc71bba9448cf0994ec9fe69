Welcome to NFL schedule release week! The NFL masters of promotion have somehow found a way to make the release of their schedule into one of the biggest days on the offseason calendar. It is amazing how much interest there is in the schedule of games coming out with four months to go before those games will be kicked off. Consider, also, that we already know who the opponents are and where the games will be played. We’re just waiting to find out which week each game will be. Still, the schedule is a huge factor in how teams fare. Catch a team at the right time and it can mean a win instead of a loss and vice versa. We’re not able to predict injuries or other things that will come up during the course of the season, but we have an idea of some teams you’d rather see early in the season and avoid later in the season.
