A valet parking attendant at a Westchester County country club allegedly stabbed two other valets as the club hosted a wedding, police and reports said. Elijah Santiago, 25, was charged in the stabbing of two brothers he worked alongside at the VIP Country Club in New Rochelle on Wednesday, according to reports. One victim was listed in critical condition after he was stabbed in the abdomen, while the other victim was slashed on the back, New Rochelle Police Department said in a news release. Santiago used a folding knife and severed an artery of the man stabbed in the stomach, according to local news site Talk of the Sound. He allegedly attacked the first victim, whose brother ran to intervene when he saw the violence unfold, according to the site. The brother with the wound to the back told police he was holding his brother on the ground after the stabbing “attempting to stop his guts from coming out,” the site said. The attacker allegedly tried to flee in a vehicle down a street along the Long Island Sound that ended in a dead end where he was arrested, sources said. Santiago was charged with two counts of felony assault in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon, cops said.
