The internet has jokes for Tom Brady after learning the Buccaneers quarterback already has another lucrative job lined up after his NFL career is finished. Fox Sports confirmed Tuesday that Brady will join the network as its lead analyst, calling the NFL’s biggest games, after he hangs up his jersey for good. That was all critics needed to troll Brady about his seemingly never-ending love affair with football, which has kept him from spending more time with his supermodel wife Gisele Bunchen and their kids — son Benjamin, 12, and daughter Vivian, 9. Brady has a 14-year-old son, Jack, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan. “[Tom Brady] proactively finding ways to avoid packing school lunches is hero status,” one person tweeted. “Pending Gisele’s approval,” another fan tweeted about his new Fox gig. “Tom Brady been saying he wants to retire cause he owes his time to his family now.. Dude just took a job to call football games all season long once he does retire. It’s really f–k them kids lmao,” another fan tweeted. In response to the news about his forthcoming gig with Fox, Brady tweeted, “Excited, but a lot of unfinished business on the field with the @Buccaneers.” Brady announced after last season he was walking away from the field, but announced the end of his short 40-day retirement in March to return to Tampa Bay to take care of some “unfinished business.” He later explained that the “very bitter ending” to last season — when the Buccaneers suffered a 30-27 loss to the Rams in the NFC Divisional Round — didn’t sit well with him. Los Angeles went on to beat the Bengals to win the Super Bowl in February. Brady, who turns 44 in August, addressed life after football in an interview last May, and admitted he was “a little fearful” of the time when he stops playing the game that’s earned him seven Super Bowl titles. That was also during a time when Brady didn’t yet have a broadcast seat waiting for him.
