Good morning, Moscow! Coffee giant Starbucks has followed McDonald’s lead and has closed all 130 outlets across Russia. With nowhere else to turn, citizens in need of a fix are turning to their Stolichnaya blend, a clear roast. Take two on the Guardians and Tigers. Inclement weather in Detroit on Friday, so our play was washed away. Shane Bieber is still scheduled to take his turn Saturday. One win from eight starts for the Biebs, but he has held up his end of the bargain by limiting opponents to three runs over his last 13 innings. Alex Faedo, who may go for Detroit, has made four lukewarm starts since being recalled from the Toledo Mud Hens, allowing 22 hits over 21 innings. Don’t break my heart, Faedo. Staying with our 10-unit play on the Guardians. Friday cancellation has us holding at +476 shesterkins.
