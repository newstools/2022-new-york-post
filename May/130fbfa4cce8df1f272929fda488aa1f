It may technically still be spring, but Busy Philipps is already concentrating on summer. Summer Dutkowsky, that is. Philipps got her start on TV hits “Dawson’s Creek,” “ER” and “Cougar Town,” but now she’s starring on the comedy “Girls5eva” as Summer, a member of a pop group hoping to make a musical comeback two decades after their last hit (Season 2 premieres on Peacock tonight). When she’s not filming or recording her podcast, “Busy Philipps Is Doing Her Best,” the actress, 42, will be taking a much-needed vacation in Charleston, S.C., this summer with her writer-producer husband Marc Silverstein and kids Birdie, 13, and Cricket, 8. Here are some of the eclectic things she’ll have stashed in her suitcase.
