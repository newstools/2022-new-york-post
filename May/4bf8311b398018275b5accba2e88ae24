The Rangers are four wins away from the Stanley Cup Finals. In thorough fashion – a two-goal lead after one period, three goals after two – the Rangers took the Carolina crowd out of Game 7 then took the Hurricanes out of the series with a 6-2 win Monday night in a match that was not that close. Igor Shesterkin saved 37 shots, but the Rangers didn’t need him to be nearly as effective. The Rangers blocked 25 shots in front of him, and they were dominant on the other side of the ice, too. Twice the Rangers connected for power-play goals, the first an Adam Fox wrister that gave them a lead they never would relinquish. Chris Kreider scored twice, Mika Zibanejad contributed three assists and 12 different Rangers had at least one point. They looked right at home at PNC Arena.
