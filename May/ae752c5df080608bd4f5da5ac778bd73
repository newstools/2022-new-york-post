A personal trainer has become an optical illusion as she can hide she’s nine months pregnant in plain sight. Jordan Edwards posted a video where she flaunted her body. The expectant mother sported a black baseball hat, an orange tank top, and black leggings to complete her look. She filmed herself standing face front of a mirror. In her stance, she looked very fit with her toned legs and arms. But, when she turned to the side, Edwards revealed her pregnancy belly. She then revealed that she was 36 weeks along. “I guess it’s just an optical illusion,” she wrote. “Must be the pants!” Following her posting her video, many took to her comment section to express how shocked they were. One woman wrote: “I have watched it a bunch of times and I still can’t believe it.” “Meanwhile I’m here looking pregnant from all angles even though I’m not,” a second shared. And a third commented: “Watching this for the hundredth time and I’m still mind blown.” However, one person cracked the code to her optical illusion. “It’s not a transition,” she wrote. “It’s the placement of her hand on her waist. “She has her hand halfway forward and then pulls it back.” Were you able to figure out that she was pregnant?
