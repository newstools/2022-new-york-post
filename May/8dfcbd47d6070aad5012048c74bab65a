An armed duo punched, robbed and shot at a Chinese food deliveryman in Crown Heights over the weekend, according to cops and video. The suspects made off with his food delivery, cellphone — and $5, police said. The 36-year-old victim was walking down steps carrying a delivery bag of food at the building on Lefferts Avenue near Lamont Court in Brooklyn around 9:20 p.m. Saturday when the suspects approached him, cops said. One of the suspects pulled a gun on him as the pair cornered him on the steps, according to the footage released late Monday. Then the pair punched the victim in the face before snatching the items, cops said. The victim chased the robbers outside the building, prompting one of them to open fire at him, police said. The delivery worker was not struck and refused medical attention at the scene. Cops are still looking for both suspects. The incident came a week after Queens Chinese-food deliveryman Zhiwen Yan, 45, was shot dead at 108th Street and 67th Drive in Forest Hills, Queens, cops said. The owner of the Great Wall restaurant on Queens Boulevard told The Post that the disgruntled customer who is being sought for questioning in the case previously flipped out over the amount of duck sauce he got with an order.
