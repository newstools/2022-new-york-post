An Arby’s manager allegedly urinated in the milkshake mix at the fast-food eatery for his own “sexual gratification” on at least two occasions, cops said. Stephen Sharp, who was being investigated for child pornography, admitted to police that he enjoyed relieving himself in the restaurant’s milkshake mix while working as a night manager at a Vancouver, Washington location, according to police. The Arby’s manager was arrested by Vancouver police and confessed to downloading and distributing child pornography and having a sexual interest in children on May 10. Officers executed a search warrant and uncovered dozens of photos and videos depicting the sexual exploitation of children as well as the urine video on his digital devices. He downloaded the disturbing content within the proximity of the chain restaurant on at least one occasion, police said. Investigators are now looking for any unlucky customers who bought and drank the urine-contaminated shakes. Vancouver police asking anyone who purchased a milkshake from the Arby’s located at 221 Northeast 104th Ave. on Oct. 30 or Oct. 31 and has a receipt to contact them. No other employees of the east Vancouver Arby’s location are believed to have known about the manager’s fetish for urinating in the shake mix, according to law enforcement. Sharp was charged with four counts of possession of depictions of minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, four counts of dealing depictions of minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct and assault. Police are still investigating the library of illicit videos and images on Sharp’s devices.
