Game 1 had everything. Not one, not two, but three overtimes. One hundred fifty-one shots saved by three goalies, the Penguins needing to swap their netminder midway through the second overtime. Igor Shesterkin was nothing short of spectacular in his NHL playoff debut. But about five hours after the puck dropped and about two hours after the Rangers briefly believed they were heading for a victory, they discovered the thrilling first game of what they hope will be a lengthy postseason run lacked one thing: a satisfying ending. The Penguins outlasted the Rangers – and perhaps for the first time in sports journalism history, that verb is accurate – in a marathon, 4-3 the final in a game that pushed the players to the limit. Evgeni Malkin redirected a wrister from John Marino – who dove in front of a Rangers shot in the second overtime, sacrificing his body and somehow getting back to his skates – for the game-winner. Fans left the Garden deflated, shuffling out just before midnight and probably checking if their modes of transportation still were running.
