There’s a hidden menu for your iPhone Photos app that you can access in seconds. A clever gesture will quickly unlock some fast-access features for the app. It’s all linked to an Apple feature called Quick Actions, and works from the Home Screen. Simply long-press on an app icon to unlock a hidden iPhone menu. It might not work for all apps, but many support this feature. And that includes Apple’s own Photos app. Hold your finger down on the Photos icon and a menu will pop up. The top two options are Apple-specific Quick Actions. One is to simply remove the app from the Home Screen, and another lets you move the app around. But the bottom four options will let you quickly navigate to specific features inside Photos. First up is Search, which is a seriously handy feature. You can search for specific terms like “lake”, “dog” or “cheese”. And just as if you were searching on Google Images, you’ll be able to find relevant photos in your own reel. You can even search for specific events, like a concert that you went to. “Photos for iOS can use the time and location of your photos along with online event listings to find matching photos,” Apple explained. “It’s also possible to search by location. So you can enter a place name like London to track photos of your trip to the UK capital. Second on the list is One Year Ago. This does what it says on the tin: you can quickly find photos and videos from a year ago. Third is Favourites, allowing you to instantly navigate to that folder. If you don’t use Favourites, it’s worth trying. It’s a great way to save your best images – just tap the heart at the bottom of a photo to “favorite” one. Finally, the Most Recent button will immediately take you to your latest photo. It removes a step if you’d normally open your Photos app first to navigate to the newest image.
