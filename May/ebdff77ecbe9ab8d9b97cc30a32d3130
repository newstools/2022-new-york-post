Karl-Anthony Towns’ girlfriend, Jordyn Woods, is enjoying splitting her time between Minnesota and Los Angeles. Woods took to Instagram on Sunday to share a video recap of her courtside experience at Timberwolves games this past season after Minnesota was eliminated from their first-round playoff series by the Grizzlies in six games. In her post, which included a tribute note to fans, Woods revealed a behind-the-scenes look at her life as an NBA WAG. “Wow I can’t believe it’s all over,” Woods captioned her post. “To my people I met this season, you guys are family now  see you next year .” She shared clips from various Timberwolves games, and included a video that showed her mom, Elizabeth, laughing court side with Ja Morant’s dad, Tee, after Minnesota’s 114-106 Game 6 loss to the Grizzlies last Friday. On Sunday, Towns and Woods enjoyed a date night at Target Center, where the Minnesota Lynx topped the Las Vegas Aces, 89-86, in a preseason thriller. The couple sat court side with Towns’ teammate Jordan McLaughlin and his fiancée Anissa Claiborne, who was also featured in Woods’ video post. Woods and Towns will celebrate their second anniversary as a couple later this month. The NBA All-Star and fitness entrepreneur were best friends for years before they became romantic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Woods supported Towns throughout the pandemic, including through difficult times after the deaths of seven of his family members, including his mother, Jacqueline Towns — who passed away from COVID-19 in April 2020. Last month, Woods paid tribute to Towns in a post on Instagram after a Timberwolves win against the Clippers that took place on the two-year anniversary of his mother’s passing.
