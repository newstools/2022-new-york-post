A “heartbroken” Novak Djokovic is trying to help his former coach and mentor who is currently in prison. The world No. 1 took time during the to address the situation with Boris Becker, behind bars for hiding assets, after his third-round win at the French Open. Becker worked with Djokovic from 2014-16, and the two remained close. “Even when we stopped working, our relationship kept going in a right way,” Djokovic said after topping Aljaz Bedene in straight sets on Friday. “I have been in touch with one of his sons, Noah, and asking if there is something that I could do. “It’s terrible. I’m just very sad that someone I know so well, and of course someone that is a legend of our sport, is going through what he’s going through. It’s been only less than a month. We know how long he has to be there. So I just hope that he will stay healthy and strong.” Djokovic, who won his fourth-round match Sunday over Diego Schwartzman in straight sets and will face Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals, also touched on the recent election in Australia, won by Anthony Albanese. Djokovic’s visa was canceled when he refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19. That triggered a three-year ban from his returning to the country. “In terms of the government, yes, I heard the news,” he said. “But I don’t know anything about whether my visa is going to be reinstated or whether I’m going to be allowed to come back to Australia. “I don’t hold any grudges. Look, you know, it was what it was. If I have an opportunity to go back to Australia and play a place where I made the biggest success in my career on grand slam, I would love to come back.”
