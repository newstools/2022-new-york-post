Three people carjacked an off-duty NYPD police officer and stole his wallet in Queens on Saturday night, law enforcement sources said. Two men and a woman took the victim’s 2017 white Honda CVR at gunpoint in front of 101-24 78 St. in Howard Beach just before 9:30 p.m., the sources said. The cop was not armed and didn’t identify himself as a member of the NYPD, according to the sources. He was not injured. The vehicle was later recovered in the Rockaways, but the suspects remained at large, sources said.
