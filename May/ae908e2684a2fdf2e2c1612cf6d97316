Disney World’s new, state-of-the-art roller coaster is making customers sick to their stomachs — forcing theme park officials to hand out “barf bags” to nauseated passengers, according to a new report. The new ride at Disney World’s Epcot theme park, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind — which rotates 360 degrees and has the first-ever reverse launch on a roller coaster in Disney history — is causing intense motion sickness among some patrons, according to Disney blog Inside the Magic. The roller coaster, which officially opened on Friday, is so bad that Disney even added employees at the end of the ride to hand out barf bags for sick customers, one rider wrote on Twitter. “A very large amount of people taking barf bags at the exit … I get it! We rode row 1 and I’m still making this face,” he griped. The Marvel-themed ride, which is billed as a mix between the half-century-old Space Mountain and the kid-friendly Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster, has been getting complaints since last month when customers began testing out the new ride. One Disney fan quipped that the Mouse House would soon be charging for the free motion sickness bags. “I’m just waited for Disney to start charging for the barf bags…,” one fan wrote on Twitter. Despite leaving some queasy, the ride, which is the first roller coaster to be built at Epcot, is attracting big crowds and rave reviews from many fans on Twitter. “It is rare that I am left speechless after a ride, but with Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, I am truly speechless,” one rider raved. “If you have the chance, please please experience this attraction, it is truely something to behold. 10/10.” Disney officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent months, Disney theme parks have been under a microscope over price hikes and longer lines since the pandemic has waned. Customers griped about being nickle-and-dime on food, parking and line reservations that were less expensive pre-COVID.
