Ryan Seacrest apparently revealed a little too much during the “American Idol” season finale on Sunday. The host, 47, told Kelly Ripa about a behind-the-scenes wardrobe change on Monday’s episode of “Live With Kelly and Ryan,” saying that, during a commercial break on “Idol,” his stylist, identified only as Miles, bluntly announced: “We need to change your underwear.” “Apparently, America voted, and decided there was anatomy in the shot,” Seacrest quipped. “And I said, ‘Well, Miles, I didn’t bring any extra underwear,’” Seacrest continued. But Miles was apparently prepared for a switcheroo. “He says, ‘Don’t worry — I’ve got mine,’” Seacrest recalled to an aghast Ripa. “Nope. No,” a shocked Ripa, 51, declared. “Change the camera shot — crotch up.” “So we go backstage during the commercial and find a little corner,” he said. “And I’m literally taking off my pants, off my underwear and putting his on.” “No, no,” Ripa continued with her arms crossed. “Guys, anything for the show, right?” he told the incredulous “Live” audience. “It’s a family show.” When asked what Ripa would’ve done, she insisted she would have them adjust the camera angle, because “women do not share panties.” “For the record, they weren’t panties,” Seacrest clarified. “They were tight, elastic underwear.” Ripa then jokingly asked if Seacrest’s original pair of underwear was “diminishing or enhancing.” “I don’t know — I didn’t read the comments and I never will,” he laughed. “Oh, well, I would’ve insisted they stay,” she said. Earlier in the season, “Idol” judge Katy Perry also suffered a wardrobe malfunction when she fell out of her chair while dressed as Ariel from “The Little Mermaid.”
