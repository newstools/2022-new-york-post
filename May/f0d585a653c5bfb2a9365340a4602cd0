Views from this just-listed Malibu retreat include a grove of eucalyptus trees and other lush plantings — and should a prospective owner look outside at the right time of year, they’ll see the green leaves covered in an array of orange tones. Even better than fall foliage, this newly built $13.99 million manse stands in a monarch butterfly sanctuary — and these grounds act as a rest stop as they flutter their way from Canada to Mexico, and vice versa. It happens “from October to March,” said listing representative Mark Kitching, of Douglas Elliman, adding “They stay close to each other for warmth and … it looks like they become the tree. You can’t even see the trees.” Thanks to this spectacular annual event, the sanctuary comes certified by the local Coastal Commission — and beyond the impressive spread of eucalyptus trees, the property also has palm trees and mature oaks on its grounds. “It’s a pretty special place,” said Kitching. Located in Ramirez Canyon, the property — also located near Paradise Cove beach, thanks to a private tunnel below the Pacific Coast Highway — sits on 1.6 acres. Its bones include five bedrooms and eight bathrooms inside light-tone, and light-filled, interiors with high ceilings. The home measures about 7,000 square feet. Images show floor-to-ceiling windows that accent a modern-looking facade — as well as spaces for a library, dining, lounging and gaming, with an area for billiards next to a wet bar. There’s also a large eat-in kitchen, whose long window looks out to the eucalyptus grove and whose breakfast bar looks to the ocean. There’s also room for a gym. Outside, beyond the butterfly views, a new owner can also get a 50-foot pool and spa, plus a pool house with a kitchen and a barbecue area. Also outside, meditation and yoga decks, and other areas for lounging. The home additionally comes automated, and it has indoor and outdoor speakers, and a Tesla solar and battery back-up system.
