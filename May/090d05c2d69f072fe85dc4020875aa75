The Boston Celtics come off a grueling seven-game series against the Milwaukee Bucks and now visit the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night. It’s a quick turnaround for a Celtics team that had to fight back from a 3-2 deficit and needed its stars to play heavy minutes in a physical series. Historically teams who come off wins in Game 7 haven’t performed well, going 32-49 (39 percent) straight up in Game 1 of the following series. Making matters worse, Marcus Smart is questionable for Game 1 with a mid-foot sprain suffered in Game 7 and Robert Williams is still dealing with knee soreness and the Celtics could struggle against a Heat team that was fourth in Defensive Rating (109.2) in the regular season and is second in the postseason (104.8). The Heat and the Celtics have the two best defenses out of the remaining postseason teams. Boston was first in Defensive Rating in the regular season (106.9) and is third among postseason teams (107.4). Although the Heat have been dominant offensively throughout the postseason, I’m expecting them to take a step back in this series, especially without Kyle Lowry.
