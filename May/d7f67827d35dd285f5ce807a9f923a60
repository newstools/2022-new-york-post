Besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler spilled some secrets about past acquaintances during a Saturday event for “Netflix Is a Joke: The Festival.” The “Saturday Night Live” duo played a game during the “In Conversation” panel where they were asked, “Who is the most famous person to ever hit on you?” Fey, 51, revealed that Kevin Spacey, 62, took a liking to her after he hosted the NBC sketch show in 2006. “This is the kind of weird thing that used to happen to me. One time when he was hosting ‘SNL,’ at the after-party, it was late and Kevin Spacey tried to hit on me,” Fey told the audience. She went on, “I was like, ‘Who is this for? Who is this little performance for?’ “ Poehler, 50, joked that the “30 Rock” creator and star “really blew it.” The “Parks and Recreation” actress claimed that late former Republican presidential candidate John McCain once tried to approach herself. Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple men in 2017 while the #MeToo movement was at its all-time high. The two also dropped a juicy tidbit of gossip for the crowd, with Fey divulging that many years ago, she wanted to set up Poehler with actor James Marsden. However, the Prince Edward of “Enchanted” politely turned her down. “You were newly single, I knew he was newly single,” Fey noted of Marsden, 48. The “Mean Girls” screenwriter continued, “We were at the [Emmys or Golden Globes] and we were going to an after-party. I got it in my head that I was going to set you up with James Marsden. I was walking out, and I was like, ‘Jimmy, you should come to our after-party.’ He’s like, ‘Oh, maybe I will,’ and I was like, ‘No, you should definitely come to our afterparty.’ I was drunk.” Fey added, “I realized in my drunkenness that he thinks I was trying to f – – k him, and I’m a married lady and he’s a gentleman. I wasn’t.” The Post reached out to Spacey and Fey’s reps for comment.
