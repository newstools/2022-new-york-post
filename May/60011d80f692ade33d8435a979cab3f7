The James Madison softball team has canceled the rest of its season after sophomore catcher Lauren Bernett’s death. Bernett died by suicide, according to multiple reports citing the Virginia Chief Medical Examiner’s Western District. She was 20 years old. “This was an extremely difficult decision and one that was not made lightly,” James Madison head coach Loren LaPorte said in a statement. “We are so grateful for the support of our fans all season and for the love from the softball community during the past week. We will use this time to continue healing and to honor Lauren’s memory while finishing the academic semester strong. Most importantly, we’re thinking about our graduating seniors whose careers have come to an abrupt conclusion. We will make sure that they are honored for the commitment and dedication they have made as student-athletes at James Madison University.” The school announced Bernett’s death last Tuesday, a day after she was named Colonial Athletic Association Player of the Week. The team had four games remaining after canceling five games last week. Bernett, who helped the Dukes reach the 2021 Women’s College World Series, was a native of McDonald, Penn. Bernett’s teammates shared touching memories of her last week. “Words can’t describe the friendship we had and how much it meant to me! You had my back no matter the time of the day. From us jamming to country music, late night roomie talks, to our catcher chats. I’m going to miss you more than anything. Fly High, 22,”” Emily Phillips wrote on Twitter.
