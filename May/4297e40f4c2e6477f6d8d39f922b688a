Seven people were shot Sunday morning in separate incidents in New York City, two of them fatally, police said. The fatal shootings both took place in Brooklyn, the first at around 12:22 a.m., when a 45-year-old man identified as Donovan Davy was struck in the neck and right leg at East 35th Street and Church Avenue. He was rushed to Kings County Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to police. Several hours later, at 10:40 a.m., another man died after being struck by gunfire at 301 Sutter Avenue in Brownsville’s Langston Hughes Apartments, cops said. No further details were immediately available. There were no immediate arrests in either homicide. Minutes before midnight Sunday, a man was struck by gunfire in his buttocks during a dispute at 171st Street and Liberty Avenue in Queens. He was rushed to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition. Bullets flew again around 2:44 a.m. at Throop Ave and Bartlett Street in Brooklyn, where a man was shot in the right leg, stomach and buttocks, cops said. He was taken to King’s County Hospital in stable condition. The shooter fled the scene. Then, at around 4:30 a.m., three people were struck by gunfire outside 252 Dumont Avenue, also in Brooklyn, cops said. A 45-year-old woman was grazed in her right calf, a 16-year-old boy was grazed in his chest and a 45-year-old man suffered a gunshot wound to his chest and arm, police sources said. The teen was believed to be the man’s son and the woman was apparently unrelated. All three were uncooperative with police, the sources said.
