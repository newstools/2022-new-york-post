Two people were found dead in a burning car near a Bronx golf course early Monday, authorities said. Police and fire officials responded around 4:15 a.m. to Shore Road near the Pelham Split Rock Course — where they discovered a Honda Accord on the side of the road engulfed in flames, authorities said. First responders discovered the bodies — whose age and gender were not immediately known — in the driver’s seat and the front passenger seat, cops said. Both were pronounced dead on scene by EMS. The fire broke out in a desolate area, and there did not appear to be any collision involved, police said. The circumstances remain under investigation, and the city medical examiner will determine the victims’ cause of death.
