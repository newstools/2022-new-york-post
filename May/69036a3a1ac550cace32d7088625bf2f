In the world of ever-changing trends, it can be hard to keep up with what’s what. The latest fad taking over TikTok is an exercise regimen dubbed the “hot girl walk.” A 22-year-old TikToker – Mia, username @exactlyliketheothergirls – is the self-titled “Creator of the Hot Girl Walk™” per her account’s biography. According to Mia, there are three rules to the hot girl walk: The idea is to incorporate exercise and movement into your daily routine while staying positive and uplifting yourself. When negative thoughts come to mind during a hot girl walk, Mia suggests turning up your playlist and jamming to your favorite song. The hot girl walk knows no bounds – it can be taken outside or inside, on a treadmill or on foot. Although a walk may not seem like exercise, fitness experts have weighed in on the many health benefits provided by the action. Certified nutritionist Vanessa Liu believes a beneficial hot girl walk should take about an hour, with a pace of three to four miles per hour, according to Bustle. Ideally, the walk should be around four miles long, with about 10,000 steps taken. “When you take a walk, you are increasing your blood flow which, in turn, helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,” said personal trainer Shanda Sullivan. “It’s also a great alternative to high-intensity workouts, offering many of the same heart-healthy benefits.” Walking regularly also helps to strengthen the leg, glute, and core muscles.
