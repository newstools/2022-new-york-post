Camila Giorgi’s French Open run came to an end on Monday following a weekend filled with wardrobe drama. The Italian tennis player — who caused a stir Saturday after an official seemingly took issue with the size of an advertising logo on her attire — dropped her fourth-round match to Daria Kasatkina of Russia, 6-2, 6-2. Kasatkina now advances to Tuesday’s quarterfinal and a matchup with Veronika Kudermetova. Prior to Monday’s match against Kasatkina, all eyes had been on Giorgi, as the world No. 30 had previously sported the logo for the kitchen appliance manufacturer, DeLonghi, across her chest during a third-round win over Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus. An umpire is said to have chatted with Giorgi before Saturday’s match against Sabalenka, with Giorgi reportedly saying, “I don’t have any change, this is my only dress. I played with it before,” according to News.com.au. Giorgi wore a similar ensemble in Monday’s loss to Kasatkina, but the call out to DeLonghi was located on the sleeve of her dress instead. She also gave the company a shoutout on her Instagram Story, posting a photo of herself from Saturday’s victory. In addition to sharing action shots from the court, Giorgi frequently posts photos of her day-to-day looks on Instagram, where she boasts nearly 600,000 followers. Recently, Giorgi shared an image of herself lounging on a couch ahead of the French Open, as she modeled a black mini dress and matching heels.
