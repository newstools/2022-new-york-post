Derek Jeter has a fan in Paige Spiranac. On Tuesday’s episode of her “Playing A Round” podcast, the 29-year-old recapped her recent experience at the Derek Jeter Celebrity Invitational, where she was paired with the Yankees legend, 47, and could not stop singing his praises. “He is one of the nicest guys I have ever met,” Spiranac said of Jeter, who hosted the star-studded event in the Bahamas and raised over $1 million for his Turn 2 Foundation. “I think with a lot of these celebrities, and especially athletes, they’re very full of themselves, and I think you do need a bit of that to be very successful, you need to have confidence in yourself and a lot of them are very narcissistic and cocky, and he is the exact opposite.” Spiranac added how Jeter asked questions about her life and career during their time together, which she said can be a rarity when it comes to stars of his magnitude. “I would say about 90 percent of the time he was asking me about my career and just about my life, he was asking me so many questions, which is something that doesn’t really happen when you’re around these celebrities and athletes,” Spiranac said. “Again, just one of the coolest, coolest, nicest guys that I’ve met, which is always nice when you have that experience because there’s been so many times when I’ve met someone, who I was really excited to meet, and I was really disappointed with the interaction that I had with them. And so that happened a lot, early on in my career, and so now, I really don’t have high expectations of meeting anyone, and when you meet someone and they’re way cooler than you expect them to be, it’s awesome.” Although the experience with Jeter is something Spiranac won’t forget, she had one qualm about the weekend. “I played like absolute garbage,” she said. “I was so embarrassed. I couldn’t hit a shot on the first couple holes and I’m like, ‘What is going on?'” Despite a challenging day on the course, Spiranac recovered a few days later by shooting a 66.
