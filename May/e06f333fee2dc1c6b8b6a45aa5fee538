Jack Kehler, best known for his role in “The Big Lebowski,” has died aged 75. His son, Eddie Kehler, revealed the heartbreaking news to Deadline on Monday, explaining his beloved father died of complications of leukemia. The actor, who starred as The Dude’s landlord Marty in the 1998 classic, died at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Saturday. Kehler’s glittering TV career kickstarted in 1983 when he landed the role of a gas station attendant in “Strange Invaders.” Although it was a small role, it did eventually lead him to star as Sergeant Cooper in the 1986 miniseries “Fresno.” Kehler starred in the 1991 hit movie “Point Break” alongside Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, and later secured a part in Lawrence Kasdan’s crime drama “Grand Canyon” the same year. His onscreen career also bagged him guest roles in “Waterworld,” “McKenna,” and “Murder One.” In the 2000s, he briefly appeared in shows such as “7th Heaven,” “NYPD Blue,” “24,” and “Mad Men.” In recent years, Kehler starred in a recurring role in Prime Video’s show “The Man in the High Castle.” His final onscreen hurrah was on Hulu’s smash show “Love, Victor” last year. Kehler is survived by his wife, Shawn Casey; his son, Eddie, and his wife Marie-Anne; as well as their son, Liam.
