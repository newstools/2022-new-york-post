A Capitol rioter who was turned in by his ex-girlfriend after he called her a “moron” in a text message pleaded guilty to a felony charge for his role in the siege on Tuesday, a report said. Pennsylvania resident Richard Michetti copped to one count of obstruction of an official proceeding in a virtual hearing in DC federal court, NBC News reported. He’s scheduled to be sentenced in September, according to the report. Michetti was arrested in February 2021 after his ex-girlfriend contacted law enforcement on Jan. 7 and told them he had texted her messages and two videos while he was on the grounds of the Capitol building a day prior, according to charging documents against him. In the messages, Michetti ranted about conspiracy theories on the 2020 election being rigged against Donald Trump — and at one point called his ex “a moron.” “If you can’t see the election was stolen you’re a moron,” and “This is our country do you think we live like kings because no one sacrificed anything?” Michetti wrote to his former romantic partner, who was not identified in court papers. “[T]he vote was fraud and trump won but they won’t audit the votes. We are patriots we are not revolutionaries the other side is revolutionaries they want to destroy this country and they say it openly,” he continued. As part of his plea deal, Michetti admitted to breaching the Capitol building with fellow rioters as they attempted to stop the certification of the 2020 election. Michetti admitted he “gesticulated” at police officers and that he pinched the sleeve of a cop during the riot, according to the NBC report. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.
