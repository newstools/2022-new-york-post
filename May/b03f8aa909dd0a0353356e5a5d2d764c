Elon Musk called out an old Hillary Clinton tweet as a “hoax” Friday after a Twitter user flagged it for misleading disinformation and was ignored. The tweet, written Oct. 31, 2016 during Clinton’s failed presidential campaign, is a statement issued in response to a news report about an alleged secret server at Trump Tower that was being used to covertly communicate with Russia. “Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank,” Clinton wrote in the tweet alongside the statement issued by one of her then-top aides, Jake Sullivan. A Twitter user tagged Musk in the message and wrote that they’ve reported it “as misleading disinformation” to the company but it was never taken down and does not have a warning label attached to it. “I would be interested to know if, when you receive control over the company, anything was done with this at any level. Pls advise soonest,” the user wrote to Musk. The Tesla CEO responded that they were “absolutely correct.” “That tweet is a Clinton campaign hoax for which their campaign lawyer is undergoing a criminal trial,” Musk wrote, linking to a BBC story about the trial of Michael Sussman, Clinton’s 2016 campaign attorney. “.@paraga and @vijaya, what say you?” Musk wrote, tagging Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s CEO, and Vijaya Gadde, the company’s Legal, Policy and Trust Lead. Sussman is accused of lying to the FBI when he met with an agent about former President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia and prosecutors say he “manipulated” the agency in a misbegotten bid to snag the election. Sussman has pleaded not guilty. Musk has been in the process of buying Twitter but the deal is on hold until the company provides proof showing the true amount of spam accounts it has.
