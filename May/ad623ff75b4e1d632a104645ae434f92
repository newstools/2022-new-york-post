Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the nation’s newly formed Disinformation Governance Board should take a look at the White House after a tweet from President Biden which attempted to link skyrocketing inflation with the country’s corporate tax rate. “The newly created Disinformation Board should review this tweet, or maybe they need to form a new Non Sequitur Board instead,” Bezos scoffed in tweet late Friday night. “Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection.” Inflation — which took off the moment President Biden stepped into the White House —  surged to 8.3% in April, approaching a 40 year record. Prices for basic commodities like food and gasoline have soared. “You want to bring down inflation?,” Biden asked in a tweet Friday.  “Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.” The Department of Homeland Security’s Disinformation Governance Board has come in for widespread criticism over its stated goal to fight disinformation on social media. It’s director Nina Jankowicz has been derided as a partisan hack, who has publicly talked about verified (and overwhelmingly left-leaning) Twitter users being able to “edit” tweets from others on the platform.
