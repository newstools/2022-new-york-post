A delinquent dad was exposed by his own smoking gun. A father is under fire for recklessly using his son for target practice, by shooting a cigarette out of the boy’s mouth with an assault rifle. Footage of the sadistic stunt of extreme child endangerment is currently being shared by activists on social media. Like some twisted William Tell, the appalling knucklehead, who was not identified in the Newsflash Media report, had reportedly instructed his progeny to hold the cigarette in his mouth so he could showcase his marksmanship prowess. The accompanying 47-second clip, said to be shot somewhere in the south of Iraq, shows the gun nut’s unfortunate son standing in the foreground with the cancer stick in his mouth, head tilted so the cigarette juts straight up in the air, presumably so the target’s easier to hit. All of a sudden, Daddie Oakley walks into the frame toting a Kalashnikov (or AK) assault rifle, whereupon he crouches down into a shooting position. He then aims the weapon and fires, incredibly, blasting the tip off the smoke and narrowly missing Junior. The accidental anti-gun PSA ends with dad holding the cig stump up to the camera to boast his surgical precision. Thankfully for the boy, the man apparently put his money where his son’s mouth is with regard to his sniper skills. While Junior appeared unhurt by the trick shot, the incident was unsurprisingly condemned by an online firing squad, who implored authorities to arrest the abusive bozo and charge him with attempted murder, and declared that the children should never be fodder for such dangerous stunts. It’s yet unclear if officials actually plan to make the sadist face the music. In November, a Texas hunter accidentally shot and killed his 11-year-old daughter as a result of a tragic gun mishap.
