Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time; while he has left some money on the table in his playing career, his aggregate earnings will approach a billion dollars at the time his blockbuster contract with Fox Sports expires. The Post’s Andrew Marchand reported that Brady’s deal with Fox is for 10 years at a total of $375 million. According to Spotrac, Brady has earned about $300 million in his playing career and will be up to $333 million after the 2022 season. Here’s a breakdown of Tom Brady’s career earnings: As a sixth-round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft, Brady received just a three-year, $866,500 contract with a meager $38,500 signing bonus, according to Spotrac. His salary reached seven figures in 2002 after leading the Patriots to their first Super Bowl win. Brady would go on to sign eight different contracts with the Patriots after his rookie deal, often restructuring existing contracts and taking less money to help the team. He finished with $235,166,804 in career earnings from his 20 seasons in New England, where he won six Super Bowls. Brady’s salaries often fluctuated, but he peaked in his final year with the Patriots in 2019, when he made $23 million. When Brady made the jump to the Buccaneers in 2020, he initially signed a two-year deal. He ultimately earned $67,795,588 over the two seasons, including $39,420,588 last year after winning Super Bowl LV. He’s set to make $30 million in 2022. So, we’re at $705 million counting his playing career, plus what he stands to make this year in football plus as a broadcaster. In 2021, Forbes estimated Brady’s annual endorsements at $31 million. It is tricky to tabulate how much he has made in this arena throughout his career. Brands Brady endorses include Under Armour, Upper Deck, Fanatics, and Hertz. Brady also has many investment stakes that go beyond endorsements: TB12 (athletic performance), Autograph (an athlete NFT platform), 199 productions (his media production company), and Brady (apparel). He also received an undisclosed stake in Under Armour years before it went public. Then there’s also the fact that he’s married to Gisele Bündchen, who at one point was the highest-paid model in the world for at least 14 years in a row. As of 2014, Forbes estimated her career earnings at $386 million — and that was eight years ago.
