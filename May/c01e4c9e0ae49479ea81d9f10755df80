Tom Brady may be in the on-deck circle, but Greg Olsen will be calling the Super Bowl next February, The Post has learned. Olsen and Fox Sports have a deal in place that will make him Kevin Burkhardt’s partner on the Super Bowl on Feb. 12, 2023 in Glendale, Ariz., according to sources. The framework of the deal is in place, but the contract is not signed yet. Fox Sports declined comment. Burkhardt and Olsen are replacing Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, who left for ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” earlier in this crazy NFL TV offseason. Last year, Burkhardt and Olsen received nice reviews in Olsen’s rookie season and now will move up to Fox’s No. 1 spot on its biggest regular-season and postseason games. With Burkhardt and Olsen being promoted, Fox now has an opening for its No. 2 team. Drew Brees is a candidate for that job, according to sources, as he and NBC are set to break up after one season (though Brees denied that they are officially over). Joe Davis and Adam Amin are the favorites for the No. 2 play-by-play job. Meanwhile, Brady has signed a 10-year contract worth $375 million that will go into effect after he stops playing. Brady, who turns 45 in August, has not given an indication as to when he will hang up his cleats, so Olsen, 37, could have an extended runway to prove he is worthy of the top spot. There is a chance that Brady could join Burkhardt and Olsen for the Super Bowl if the Bucs are eliminated, though it would be a little risky to try a three-man booth in the postseason without them having any experience together. If Brady is not playing in the postseason and works for Fox, it may just be in studio. Meanwhile, for Olsen, he is going to be on the call for the Super Bowl and maybe more, as Fox has two of the next three Super Bowls.
