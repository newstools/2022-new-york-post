The body of a Yale University employee who vanished three months ago was found on the Long Island shoreline, the Ivy League school announced on Wednesday. Anton Sovetov, 44, was found dead Saturday on the New York side of the Long Island Sound shore across from where Yale is located in New Haven, Conn., the school said in a statement. The cause of death is under investigation. Yale officials didn’t specify where Sovetov’s body was found, except that it was in Suffolk County, where police are leading the investigation. “We mourn Anton’s loss,” Nate Nickerson, vice president for Communications, said in a statement. “Anton was a wonderful, devoted colleague with uncommon talent. His work honored and added to Yale’s legacy of exceptional graphic design. We will miss him dearly.” The St. Petersburg-born Sovetov was a graphic designer who worked in the Office of the University Printer and had designed a series of public health posters for campus during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an obituary posted by the school. He had received a master’s degree from the Yale School of Art in 2016, the obituary said. He was last in touch with university officials on Feb. 4 and was spotted a day later on surveillance footage walking toward his apartment in New Haven, the school stated in a news release. Sovetov was reported missing on Feb. 9. University police had offered a $10,000 reward for information on his whereabouts last month, the New Haven Register reported. Suffolk police are working with Yale and New Haven law enforcement to continue investigating Sovetov’s disappearance, the school said.
