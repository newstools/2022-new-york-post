An angry straphanger smacked an MTA worker in the head with a glass bottle on a subway platform in Manhattan’s Financial District Sunday morning, cops said. The assault happened around 2 a.m. on the northbound J subway platform at Broad Street and Wall Street after the rider “took umbrage” to a conductor trying to clear a train of passengers, according to a police source. “Someone took umbrage to being told to get off the train,” the source said. “They took a glass bottle and struck the train operator on the head.” The assailant was described as a blonde man carrying a green shopping bag. The 44-year-old victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, cops said.
