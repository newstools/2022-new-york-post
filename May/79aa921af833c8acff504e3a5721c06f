Four people were shot Thursday night during a fight outside of an Arkansas convention center that hosted a high school graduation ceremony, reports said. Gunfire erupted in a hotel parking lot near the Hot Springs Convention Center shortly after the completion of the ceremony honoring seniors from Hot Springs World Class High School, The Sentinel-Record reported, citing police and school officials. The victims were not students, officials said, and they were expected to survive their injuries, The Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. One of the victims may have been an innocent bystander, a district spokesperson told The Sentinel-Record. HSPD Officer Omar Cervantes told the Gazette that “a big fight” broke out in the nearby parking lot that led to the shooting. It wasn’t immediately clear what sparked the feud. “We can confirm that none of our current students or graduates were involved,” Hot Springs School District Superintendent Stephanie Nehus wrote on Facebook. “Our Law Enforcement Officers and staff will do all that we can to assist in the investigation. Our hearts and thoughts are with all individuals who suffered injuries tonight.” No arrests were made by early Friday morning.
