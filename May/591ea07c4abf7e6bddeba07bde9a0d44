Derek Jeter couldn’t stay away from social media forever. The Yankees legend announced his arrival to Twitter and Instagram on Tuesday morning. Jeter responded to a tweet from Dec. 9, 2014 — more than two months after his final game — which said, “Derek Jeter has no excuse not to have a Twitter account by now.” Jeter’s first tweet: “Looks like I’ve officially run out of excuses.” The 47-year-old then responded to a tweet from The Players’ Tribune, the media platform he founded, which posted a photo of a young Jeter with seemingly long hair. A caption for the photo asks, “mullet or tree?” “It’s my hair but it’s a shag… a Ralph Tresvant shag,” wrote Jeter, whose bio says he’s a “sleep-deprived father to three amazing girls.” The Yankees posted a welcome message to Jeter on their Twitter account. Though his first tweets were Tuesday, his account says he joined Twitter in April. The Hall of Famer left his post as CEO and minority owner of the Miami Marlins in February after roughly four and a half years with the club. The Post’s Joel Sherman reported at the time that Jeter believed owner Bruce Sherman had approved the team spending another $10 million to $15 million on the roster entering the MLB lockout. Jeter felt that a promise wasn’t kept. As part of a statement announcing his departure from the Marlins, Jeter said, “The vision for the future of the franchise is different than the one I signed up to lead. Now is the right time for me to step aside as a new season begins.”
