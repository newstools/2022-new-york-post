After Josh Donaldson and DJ LeMahieu both failed to run out ground balls in the Yankees’ win over the Rangers on Monday night, manager Aaron Boone was asked if he spoke to the veteran players, since he hadn’t done so immediately after the game. “We handled that stuff,’’ Boone said before the Yankees’ 6-5 comeback win over the Blue Jays on Tuesday night at the Stadium. “I definitely think it was a little bit overblown.” Donaldson didn’t run on a grounder hit to Corey Seager in the sixth inning and was thrown out even after the shortstop bobbled the ball. LeMahieu later jogged to first in the eighth, before the Yankees scored the lone run of the game. Both players were back in the lineup Wednesday, with LeMahieu at third base and Donaldson serving as the DH for a second straight game. Donaldson went 0-for-2 with a walk and a hit-by-pitch. LeMahieu went 1-for-4 with a walk and scored on Aaron Judge’s walk-off three-run homer. The 36-year-old Donaldson has been dealing with soreness in his right shoulder since spring training and Boone said it was “a little sore the other day.” Donaldson added he expected to be sore again after being drilled with a pitch near his left elbow on Tuesday.
