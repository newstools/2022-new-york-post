After three days and 262 picks, the NFL Draft can be exhausting — for everyone except Mel Kiper Jr. Kiper remained enthusiastic and willing to spend time discussing every draft pick as the rounds continued. However, as Day 3 was underway, things got a bit chaotic during ESPN’s draft coverage as Kiper and analyst Todd McShay sent friendly jabs to each other over who liked North Carolina product Ty Chandler more. Discussing an episode from the duo’s “First Draft” podcast, Kiper claimed that he had been impressed with Chandler and thought that he would be a great pick for any NFL team before McShay did. “You conveniently stole him and act like you love him, but as you always say, when I’m talking, you’re never listening, right?” Kiper said. McShay interrupted the speech by repeatedly saying Kiper’s name to get his attention before claiming that this conversation was not as big of a deal as Kiper made it out to be. “You mentioned him once and I was taking a sip of water and that was the extent of it,” McShay said. As the draft continued, Kiper was once again interrupted by McShay as he was giving a lengthy analysis of Villanova cornerback Christian Benford, who was selected by the Buffalo Bills with the 185th pick. “Hey Mel we have a show to do here,” McShay said. “We get it, Calvert Hall.” The scene ended with all the analysts laughing about the interruptions before jumping into a discussion on the next player selected. It was surely one way to keep what can be a monotonous broadcast interesting.
