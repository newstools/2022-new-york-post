Rikki Schlott had it entirely right in Sunday’s Post: There’s no reason in the world for it to be so hard to buy mace in this town. Major crimes were up 34 percent last month; robberies, 41 percent; felony assaults, 21 percent. Not to mention the subway shovings, hate crimes and so on. Yet it’s illegal to ship pepper spray to a New York address. And only a handful of stores sell mace, too. So New Yorkers — including 1.5 million single women and 1 million elderly — can’t secure a canister. Schlott details how a goon followed her into a pharmacy near Union Square and threatened rape — but she escaped after blasting her keychain pepper spray (shipped to a Jersey address). We defend New York’s gun laws, but stopping citizens from defending themselves with mace is just insane. The Legislature’s in session for a few more weeks; that’s enough time to repeal this ludicrous law.
