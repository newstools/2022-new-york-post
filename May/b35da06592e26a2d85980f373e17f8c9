On Wall Street, David Solomon is known as the ruthless, take-no-prisoners chief executive at global banking giant Goldman Sachs. But revelers at the BottleRock Napa Valley known him as DJ D Sol, the hip record-spinner who spun tunes at the popular music festival on Sunday. Solomon delighted the crowd of festival-goers at the event as he was working the booth, according to Bay Area News Group. The Goldman Sachs CEO deejayed at the festival’s Silent Disco, where patrons danced in silence while wearing headphones. The music that Solomon was spinning was beamed straight to the headphones, so only those on the dance floor could hear what he was producing. This is the second year in a row that Solomon has appeared at BottleRock, which has attracted A-list stars such as Pink, Mumford & Sons, Neil Young, Snoop Dogg, Metallica, Pitbull, and Luke Combs. Last year, Goldman employees fumed at Solomon’s appearance, which took place just days after the banking giant announced a major COVID safety clampdown as the Delta variant was raging. At the time, BottleRock didn’t require vaccines, although it said 96 percent of attendees showed proof they had gotten the jab. Partygoers also were allowed to instead show negative COVID test results. Solomon, meanwhile, had forbidden unvaccinated employees from entering Goldman’s offices. Goldman also required workers and visitors to wear masks and mandates regular testing for anyone entering a Goldman building in the US. “I guess the pandemic is over according to David Solomon?” one Goldman insider sniffed in response to his latest Instagram.
