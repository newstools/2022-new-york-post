The roller-coaster ride continues for the Mets’ Taijuan Walker (1-0, 3.52). And we are going to catch him on the upswing. Walker was filleted in Philly, giving up six runs. He followed that up with a shutout over seven strong against the Nationals. He then was removed after five innings after the Cardinals scored three runs. Time to shine again. But only if the sun shines in Colorado. Mets-Rockies was snowed out Friday. They played two Saturday. The Balboas will throw Austin Gomber on Sunday. Austin Powers has been powerless, allowing eight runs over his last 11 innings. Play 10 units on the Mets.  Super Saturday! For the second year in a row, the multi-talented Stitches nailed the winner of the Preakness. Then, after Early Voting held on, Milwaukee swatted Washington, 5-1. The Brewers bruised Patrick Corbin while Brandon Woodruff snuffed out the Nats’ bats. W takes us to +338 whirlaways.
