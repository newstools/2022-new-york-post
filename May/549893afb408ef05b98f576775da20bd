Four suspects have been indicted in the 2019 execution-style slaying of a Queens businessman gunned down on a Flushing street, federal authorities said Tuesday. The suspects, Qing Ming Yu, Antony Abreu, You You and Zhe Zhang, were each indicted in Brooklyn federal court for the early-morning hit on 31-year-old Xin Gu outside a karaoke bar on Fowler Street in the neighborhood. Investigators believe Gu’s killing stemmed from a business dispute he had with his former boss at a Manhattan property development company, Qing Ming Yu, 54, according to the feds. The victim left Yu’s company and started his own outfit, attracting several clients and employees from his former workplace, the feds allege. Enraged by the perceived slight, Yu — whose business eventually shut down at the end of 2018 — allegedly hired his nephew, 34-year-old You You, to murder Gu, authorities said. You enlisted Abreu and Zhang, both 34, to help pull off the hit, according to federal authorities. Gu was gunned down by Abreu outside the karaoke bar at about 2:30 a.m. Feb. 12, 2019, where he had been celebrating the Lunar New Year, the feds allege. Zhang acted as the wheelman during the hit, picking up Abreu in a Honda Accord with fake plates after the killing, according to the feds. Three of the suspects were arrested Tuesday morning, including Yu, who was cuffed in his eight-bedroom mansion in Oyster Bay, a law enforcement source said. Abreu was already in federal prison serving time for an unrelated case. The suspects each face two counts for murder-for-hire and a related conspiracy charge, according to court documents.
