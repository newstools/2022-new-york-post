This was not your typical ESPN NBA playoff broadcast. Mike Breen tested positive for COVID-19 and missed Game 7 between the Celtics and Heat on Sunday, while Jeff Van Gundy’s voice was noticeably hoarse throughout the broadcast. The social media speculation was running rampant, particularly given Breen’s status. Others said it was Van Gundy’s version of the Michael Jordan flu game. The Celtics held off the Heat, 100-96, to advance to the NBA Finals and a matchup with the Warriors. According to The Post’s Andrew Marchand, Breen “feels fine” and is hopeful to call Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night. Mark Jones called the Heat-Celtics Game 7 in Breen’s place.
