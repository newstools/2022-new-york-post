Oh, and for the summer: shop the hottest linen dresses, nude heels and women’s shorts to welcome the hottest temps. Check out all sunscreen on Amazon here. From the same brand that brought us the fan-favorite Lip Sleeping Mask ($22), Laneige has a hypoallergenic-tested sunscreen — infused with SPF 50 — that doesn’t leave a white cast. If you’re all about premium beauty, this one is a great formula to snag ASAP. StriVectin is more popularly known as a wonderful skincare brand for mature skin, specifically, much ado to a vast majority of its products containing retinol. Its moisturizer with SPF is, impressively, $20 off and worth the splurge this week. If you want a two-in-one product (a sunscreen and tinted moisturizer, that is), look no further than Jane Iredale’s Glow Time Full-Coverage Mineral BB Cream. It contains SPF 17, leaves your skin nourished and balanced for the summertime and comes in a wide shade selection. Babies need love and protection, too, and though Mustela’s Baby Mineral Sunscreen Spray isn’t at a tremendous discount — we’ll take it. Perfect for on-the-go use, this easy-to-apply bottle is ultra-sheer and contains SPF 30. Much like your trusty body lotion or body butter, Glcone’s formula contains glycolic acid and shea butter to help soothe the skin and reverse signs of drying or dull skin. Just shy of $50 for National Sunscreen Day, it’s a steal. Avene’s Eau Thermale Solaire UV Mineral Defense Tinted Sunscreen is great if you really don’t want a white cast and are looking for a topical that is safe for sensitive skin. Its lightweight, unscented formula is one of our favorites, especially for less than $30. What’s better than picking up one sunscreen? Picking up two sunscreens, of course! Coola’s featuring $10 off its best-selling Organic Sunscreen duo, which each boasts an SPF 70, impressively. Vichy is one of the most popular skincare brands on Amazon for skincare, so we’re thrilled it’s hosting a sale for National Sunscreen Day. Its LiftActiv Peptide-C Face Moisturizer — infused with SPF 30 — is what will carry you through the summer months (especially for helping treat fine lines and dark spots). Not a sunscreen per se, but Dermablend is hosting a sale on its Quick-Fix Full-Coverage Foundation Stick (which is available in multiple shades). Namely, it’s water-resistant, so it still falls into that must-grab category for summer. Not to mention, it’s less than $25 right now. Enter TruSkin’s Mineral Face Sunscreen, a new product from the brand that offers a cult-favorite vitamin C serum (with more than 14K rave reviews and with the skin-boosting ingredient hyaluronic acid). This sunscreen, by popular demand, includes vitamin C to brighten as well as protect the skin. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
