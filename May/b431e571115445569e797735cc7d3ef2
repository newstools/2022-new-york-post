Bra-pocalypse now. Big breasts might seem like a blessing to some. However, one buxom influencer finds her cumbersome chest to be a massive burden, as she’s allegedly forced to wear multiple bras at once to work out, among other inconveniences. The blond bombshell showed off her apparently problematic mammaries in a series of TikTok videos with millions of views. In the most viral clip with more than 2.3 million views, the well-endowed gal — named Billie, 23 — demonstrated how she dons a whopping three bras before doing “cardio” at the gym. She explained in the comments that running without them “hurt my back and my chest.” Another clip shows how her bosom makes it difficult for Billie — who goes by @billiebopbillie online — to comfortably fit into a dress. Apparently, even mealtime can prove to be an obstacle for the big-busted. In a third explainer, entitled “big b00bs problems in the kitchen,” she self-deprecatingly displays how her ample assets inadvertently touch her plate when she reaches for condiments, thereby staining her clothes with sauce. Alas, Billie’s big-breast PSAs weren’t too well received by the public, many of whom deemed her mammaries decidedly less than ample. “They’re literally not that big,” scoffed one gawker under a clip of her alleged bra-pocalypse. “Pretty sure they are fake and really not that big at all pretty standard size,” said another, to which Billie replied, “Pretty sure you’re jealous, no worries it’s pretty standard.” And while Billie never disclosed her cup size, many critics found her issue a blessing rather than a curse. “We have bigger problems u know,” shot one detractor, while another wrote, “I’m failing to see the problem.” In the realm of big-breast issues, Billie’s problems might seem like small potatoes compared to Playboy model Lindsey Pelas, who claimed her natural 30HH boobs caused her back pain so severe she couldn’t even pose.
