The Yankees wasted no time on their off day before having some fun. Aaron Judge, Anthony Rizzo and DJ LeMahieu were seated behind the benches on the lower level of Madison Square Garden for Game 2 of the Rangers’ 5-2, series-evening win over the Penguins on Thursday night. When the camera found them, all three finished their beers with the Garden crowd cheering them on. Rizzo easily won the chug. Judge and LeMahieu went down to the wire, but LeMahieu beat him to finish second. The three brought the crowd to its feet. After a weeklong road trip in which the team’s winning streak reached 11 before a 2-1 loss to the Blue Jays on Wednesday night, it was a well-deserved fun moment for the trio. At 18-7, the Yankees currently have the best record in baseball, with Rizzo and Judge contributing nine homers apiece. The Yankees return to action on Friday night against the Rangers.
