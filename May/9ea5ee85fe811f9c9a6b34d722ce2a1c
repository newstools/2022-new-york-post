This tribute to Queen Elizabeth II really rocks. The 96-year-old British monarch was honored with portraits of her projected onto Stonehenge, as part of the annual Platinum Jubilee, celebrating her 70 years on the throne. The stones feature eight portraits, including a photo from the queen’s coronation in 1953, a picture of her riding a horse in the 1960s, an appearance at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in 2017 and more. “We’ve brought two British icons together to mark the #PlatinumJubilee! We’ve projected eight portraits of Queen Elizabeth II onto Stonehenge,” said the English Heritage organization, which cares for the historic landmark, in a statement on Twitter. “Each picture is from a different decade of The Queen’s reign.” The 5,000-year-old stone monument on Salisbury Plain in England, is one of many locations throughout the country to honor the Queen’s seven-decade reign, which began when she was just 27 years old. Her reign is the longest a monarch has ever ruled Great Britain, and will be observed with a four-day public holiday from June 2 until June 5. This year’s Platinum Jubilee makes history as the first to see the queen sit out one of the kickoff events, a military parade on Thursday called Trooping the Colour. She’ll send three royal proxies in her stead: Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince William. The celebration ends on Sunday with a party at Buckingham Palace.
