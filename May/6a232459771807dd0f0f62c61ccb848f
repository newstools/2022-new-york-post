Is Christina Haack’s latest California abode her next flip, or is it a longer-term home for her growing family? The HGTV star just closed on a $12 million modern marvel located in Newport Beach, less than a year after buying a Dana Point oceanfront estate for $10.3 million, then flipping it for $11.5 million last month. An Orange County native, Haack purchased this five-bedroom, six-bathroom estate in an off-market deal last week. The property was built last year and is surrounded by glass windows. Haack apparently wanted the home so desperately that she made an offer within 60 seconds of it listing off-market, according to the listing. The Post has reached out to her rep for comment. A 30-minute drive from her last residence in Dana Point, the new pad she now shares with her husband, Joshua Hall, is slightly bigger — with 900 additional square feet of space. Spanning nearly 7,000 square feet, the highly designed haven boasts imported terrazzo, security, home automation and a movie theater, the previous listing notes. Designed by Laidlaw Schultz Architects, the home is described as a “particular masterpiece” and the “finest real estate Orange County has to offer.” Keven Stirdivant with KASE Real Estate held the listing. TMZ was the first to report the transaction. The move to buy the home comes as Haack, 38, is battling it out in court with her ex-husband, Ant Anstead, over custody of their 2-year-old son, Hudson. A judge ordered mediation, which is set to begin on June 15. In court documents obtained by The Post, Anstead, 43, accused his ex-wife of being an unfit mother and claimed she had been negligent when it came to both his and their son Hudson’s medical safety. Haack called the claims “false allegations” that “shocked” her. Meanwhile, Haack still owns a vacation home outside of Nashville, Tennessee.
