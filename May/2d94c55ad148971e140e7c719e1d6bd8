Are there big things in store for you? Or are you ready to make a change in your life? You can’t predict the future, but this optical illusion can reportedly reveal your mindset towards it, and viewers are debating the accuracy of its assertions. This image, shared in a video by the YouTube channel Bright Side, could be interpreted two different ways. Look at the image for a few seconds and decide what image jumps out. “Does it look like an open door to you?” asked the video’s narrator. “Then you’re ready for big life challenges,” he added. Along with the interpretation, the video also had some advice. “Embrace them,” the narrator said. “It’s exciting to try new things.” But what course is your future on if you didn’t see an open door? “If it’s more of a musical note to you, you feel you have something important to share with the world,” the narrator explained. Take that feeling seriously, the video advised. “Never miss a chance to express yourself,” the narrator added. Commenters shared their initial reactions to the image and to the instructions they were given regarding their futures. “Hi, the music notes!” wrote one viewer. “This one is correct!” Some people excitedly reported they saw the door first, while many music-lovers, naturally, saw the note. But not everyone was pleased with what the optical illusion revealed. “The supposed descriptions of my personality are so far off from actual reality,” said a different person who didn’t feel the test reflected their experience. “Oh, I have something I want to tell people, but no one wants to hear it,” wrote another.
