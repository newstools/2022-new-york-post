A Houston mother was arrested after police found her five young children, including a baby, alone in a filthy apartment crawling with cockroaches, police said. Charlotte Williams was charged with endangering a child with intent to return after allegedly leaving the kids without food, water or electricity for at least five hours Tuesday evening, ABC13 reported. Police said officers were called to perform a welfare check at Williams’ home at the Casa Grande Apartments on Tuesday evening. They attempted to access the apartment through the front door but found it to be blocked by a table and a mattress. A rear window was boarded up, but the cops eventually managed to climb into the home through another window. Inside, the officers said they found Williams’ children, who are ages 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11, without adult supervision in deplorable conditions. “The home was filthy with gnats, roaches, flies throughout the residence,” a hearing officer stated in court Wednesday. “There were trash bags filled with insects in the living room leading to the kitchen.” Williams’ children were taken from the filthy and foul-smelling apartment, and transported to a local hospital. Her children are now staying with relatives, the outlet reported. Neighbors told ABC13 that the children did not seem to attend school. They were last seen outside two months ago, when they were playing in the courtyard of the apartment complex at 3 a.m. Williams remained jailed Thursday on a $20,000 bond.
