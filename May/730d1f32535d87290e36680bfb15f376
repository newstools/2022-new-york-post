The popular Knicks choices to sit on the dais for Tuesday’s NBA draft lottery would be RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin or Immanuel Quickley. The Knicks have never had an active player on the stage as their representative. Or they could go with 2021 Coach of the Year Tom Thibodeau for good lottery luck in Chicago. The Knicks hold a 2 percent chance to jump up to the No. 1 pick as the 11th seed. In the 21 years of decline since James Dolan became owner, the Knicks have been repped by former stars Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier, John Starks and Allan Houston. There have been dais appearances by head coach Mike D’Antoni and front-office chiefs Steve Mills and Scott Perry. When the lottery was held via Zoom in 2020, current team president Leon Rose appeared on the screen via computer. With the lottery back to being conducted in front of a live audience, there are two choices who would be unpopular: Julius Randle and Dolan himself. The Garden boss, who has avoided Knicks media for years, has yet to sit on the dais and associate with his losing team. It’s about time he does.
