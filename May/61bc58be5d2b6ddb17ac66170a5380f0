With less than a month to go in the 2021/22 NHL, we’ve officially hit the top of the stretch. The Stanley Cup playoffs are in full swing, with the second round underway. Favorites Colorado Avalanche took down Nashville Predators in round one, and face the St. Louis blues in round two. Here are the updated Stanley Cup odds stand as we flip the calendar to April (via BetMGM):  The Colorado Avalanche entered the regular season as the betting favorite and the Avs have only solidified that position with their play during the regular season. Colorado has the best record in the NHL, ranks second in goals per game, and looks like a shoo-in to advance through the second round. The Florida Panthers check-in next at +550. The Cats came out of the gates on fire in the early going and have barely let up. The Panthers dropped the first game to the Lightning in round two, and needed Game 7 to get past the Maple Leafs in round one. No team has seen its odds shorten as dramatically as the Calgary Flames this season. Calgary came into the season as a +4500 outsider to win the Stanley Cup, but a terrific regular season has seen the Flames leap into the top-3 on the betting board at +475. A 4-3 win over the Stars took the Flames into round two, where they keep on rolling. St Louis Blues end the leaderboard of teams fighting for the Stanley Cup. They’ve been tasked with taking down favorites Colorado Avalanche in round two. A big ask, but a potential upset on the cards?
