A pair of window washers were saved by city firefighters Friday morning from a scaffolding that got stuck 42 stories up in Midtown, officials said. The FDNY got the call just after 8 a.m. when witnesses reported that the two window washers appeared to be in danger as the motorized scaffolding started leaning to one side while they working at a 53-story skyscraper at 712 Fifth Ave. Firefighters scrambled up the skyscraper and put a drone up to monitor the situation, fire officials said. After about an hour, firefighters cut a hole in the window on the 42nd floor and pulled the workers to safety. “It was a smooth operation, members worked efficiently,” FDNY Battalion Chief Robert Meuser said Friday.
