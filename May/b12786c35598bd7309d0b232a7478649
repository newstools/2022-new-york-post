A striking new retail project is set to join the downtown Brooklyn development boom. The building at 555 Fulton St. by Steven Witkoff and Apollo — shown here for the first time — will take up the wraparound corner where Fulton Street, DeKalb Avenue and Bond Street converge. Designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, it will provide one fortunate tenant with highly visible space with 7,902 square feet on the ground floor space and 6,459 more square feet on the lower level. Groundbreaking is to take place soon. GoodSpace brokers Chris DeCrosta and Hank O’Donnell said the image isn’t quite final. “Because it’s a customizable building, we’re going to market to see if a tenant wants to have a say in the final design,” DeCrosta said. They’re targeting  athletic brands such as Nike or Adidas, “which could do $40 million to $50 million in sales a year,” DeCrosta said. O’Donnell chimed in, “It’s a place to do insane business.” The brokers declined to cite an asking rent. The  area is seeing a breathless surge in commercial and residential development, including City Point, a new Ace Hotel and giant apartment towers by Extell, JDS and others.
