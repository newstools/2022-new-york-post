A man was caught on camera brandishing a gun on a Queens street around the same time the mother of an NYPD officer was shot dead inside her nearby home Wednesday afternoon. Time-stamped security footage obtained by The Post showed a gloved man clutching a firearm as he calmly walked to a black SUV parked on 109th Ave in Ozone Park at about 2:23 p.m. The timing and location captured by the video footage aligned with the NYPD’s account of the murder of Anna Torres, 51, who was shot twice after she answered the door at her single-family residence at 94-59 109th Avenue shortly before 2:30 p.m., officials said. The suspect in Torres’ death, Giuseppe Canzani, 41, fled the scene in a black Chevy Traverse and later surrendered to police about an hour later – showing up to the 106th Precinct in the same vehicle, NYPD Deputy Chief Jerry O’Sullivan said at a Wednesday night press conference. The gun-wielding man in the surveillance footage matched the description of the shooter provided by police at the press briefing. He also entered a vehicle that appeared to be a Traverse. When Canzani arrived at the police station house, he placed a .45-caliber silver firearm on the sidewalk and was arrested without incident by two officers who were outside at the time, O’Sullivan said. It wasn’t immediately clear what motivated Canzani to allegedly fatally shoot Torres and the relationship between the two was unknown. Two of Torres’ relatives were inside her home when she was shot twice, including in the head, and killed, O’Sullivan said. Canzani was expected to be charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.
