Jennifer Grey will always hold Patrick Swayze close to her heart. The 62-year-old recalled how her late “Dirty Dancing” co-star sobbed while apologizing to her on the set of their 1987 romance drama. The pair previously starred in 1984’s “Red Dawn” together before reuniting for the iconic dance flick. Grey stopped by “The View” earlier this week to discuss her memoir, “Out of the Corner,” and her tense experiences working with “The Outsiders” actor, who died in 2009 at the age of 57. “Patrick was playing pranks on me and everybody,” Grey said. “It was just, like, macho, and I just couldn’t take it. I was just like, ‘Please, this guy, that’s enough with him.'” The “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” actress then detailed how she was hesitant to sign on for “Dirty Dancing” with Swayze. However, she agreed to do a screen test with him and during their chemistry read, he brought her close and apologized for his actions. “He pulled me down the hall and said to me, ‘I love you, I love you, and I’m so sorry. And I know you don’t want me to do the movie,'” she explained. Grey went on, “And he got the tears in his eyes. And I got the tears in my eyes — not for the same reason. I was like, ‘Oh, this guy’s working me.’ And he goes, ‘We could kill it — we could kill it if we did this.'” “We go in there and he takes me in his arms and I was like, ‘Oh, boy. I’m done,'” Grey confessed. And alas, their chemistry made the film a cult classic success for decades to come. Grey also couldn’t help but gush over how the “Ghost” star carried himself on set. “There was no competition. He was, like, the easy chair I’d been dreaming of my whole life,” she said. The “Red Oaks” actress is returning for a sequel to “Dirty Dancing” in the near future. The film franchise released a prequel in 2004, “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,” and produced a made-for-TV remake for ABC in 2017.
