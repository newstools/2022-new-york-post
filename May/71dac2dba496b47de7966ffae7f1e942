The mind is a powerful thing and it can make you see things that aren’t really there. An artist has people scratching their heads as she created a mind-bending illusion. The artist, who simply goes by My Sweet Adeline on social media, recently shared an optical illusion that has people wondering how she managed to get a hole in her hand. In her video, she can be seen stuffing the hole in her hand with several objects, such as sunflower seeds, a piece of sushi, rice, and even raw beef. Many people took to the comment section to wonder just what was happening exactly. One woman wrote: “What the hell did I just watch?” A second talked about how confused they were, while another questioned: “Wait, is this hole real?” But if you watch the video several times, you might understand what’s really going on. In each of the instances of the video, Adeline’s hand is resting on a patterned background, whether that’s a piece of paper or a table. Well, all she’s doing is simply drawing the background on her hand and placing it strategically so it looks like there’s an actual hole in her hand. And many people caught on to that. One person wrote: “It’s not a hole, it’s just makeup!” A second pointed out that she simply has drawn the paper in her hand. And a third simply explained: “That’s painted on.” Were you able to figure it out on your own? This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
