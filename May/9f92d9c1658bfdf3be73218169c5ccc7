A model who was bullied at school for “looking different” has had the last laugh — seeing fans get tattoos of her face. Molly Hull, from South Wales, raised the middle finger to those who once taunted her in a video shared with her 390,000 TikTok followers. She is now an influencer and anti-bullying campaigner with over 200,000 Instagram fans who love her quirky style. Some have even had her likeness permanently inked on their bodies. Molly says in her video: “Getting bullied for not looking like everyone else as a kid.” She turns sideways to show her profile, then sticks up the middle finger in a rude gesture to the haters. Then she adds: “Now people get my face tattooed. “Stay weird.” The vid shows at least six tattoos of her face that she has been sent by fans. Molly added in the caption: “Never listen to the haters, keep doing you  one day they’ll be your biggest fan #stayweird.” One fan commented: “Imagine being so photogenic people literally have you permanently on their skin  you’re literally the main character we’re just supporting roles.” Another said: “This is amazing! I had the same problem with my nose  it’s my biggest insecurity! So much love for you!!! ♥️♥️” And another said: “My friend has your face as a tattoo!!!” In November we told how a former child star of the X Factor defied bullies to become a TikTok megastar with Snoop Dog among his fans. A man with the skin condition vitiligo who was called “zebra” by cruel classmates went on to be a catwalk model. And a girl who was mercilessly teased over her weight had the last laugh as a beauty queen. This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
