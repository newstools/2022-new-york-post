A hoodie has never been far. Six innings of Little League baseball morphed Mo’ne Davis into one of the most celebrated athletes in America, among the most famous 13-year-olds who have ever lived. While friends and peers enjoyed the carefree exhilaration of the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., Davis could only walk the grounds when her sweatshirt shielded her from view. Without the hood, she needed a golf cart and security detail to maintain a safe distance from the throngs of fans following the middle school student. Fame wasn’t a surprise — Davis planned to play basketball at UConn, perhaps to become the first woman to play in baseball’s major leagues — it just arrived ahead of schedule. At the 2014 LLWS, Davis became the first female pitcher in the history of the event to earn a win, throwing a two-hit shutout while striking out eight. She was a household name whose surname was superfluous. She dominated sports media coverage, owning a signature in such demand that forgeries were peddled on eBay. Her meals were interrupted. Her phone number had to change.
