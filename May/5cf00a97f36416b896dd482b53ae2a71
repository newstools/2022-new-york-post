The mohawk-sporting real estate exec Robert Rivani of Black Lion Investment Group — a failed former day trader and a high school dropout — just plunked down $7.5 million for a penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Miami Beach. The home, at 4701 Meridian Ave., is 4,250 square feet and comes with four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a powder room and glass walls that showcase views of the canal, Biscayne Bay and downtown Miami. Rivani bought the penthouse as an investment — for personal use and to rent, a source said. Fellow residents include the supermodel/entrepreneur Cindy Crawford and her husband, veteran nightlife industry mogul Rande Gerber, who paid $3 million for a 2,800-square-foot two-bedroom there last year. The Mets’ retired star, Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Mike Piazza, is also a resident. The condos come with amenities including an art studio, 36 private boat dockages available for purchase (plus a private, on-site captained day yacht), a chauffeured house car and a half-acre rooftop pool deck with cabanas and a grill. There’s also a gym, a yoga and meditation studio, a children’s playroom and a screening room. The 7-acre property, designed by Italian architect Piero Lissoni, was completed just before the pandemic hit in February 2020. The listing broker was Philip Freedman with Douglas Elliman; Douglas Elliman’s Dina Goldentayer repped the buyer.
