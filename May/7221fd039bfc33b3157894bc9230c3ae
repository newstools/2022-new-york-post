Paige Spiranac said she had to change her name on social media to escape being “stalked” by mean girls in college. The former golfer-turned-influencer in the sport goes by the name Paige Renee on her Instagram account, which boasts  3.3 million followers — but that wasn’t always her IG moniker. “I was very conflicted because I got the username Paige Renee because I was being stalked and harassed in college by these girls and so I had to delete my Instagram,” Spiranac explained on the latest episode of her “Playing A Round” podcast. “It was really bad, they were stalking me on campus.” When her co-host Amanda Rose asked if the matter was over “a boy,” Spiranac said, “The strength trainer at the university — I would just be in there all the time.” Spiranac played Division 1 college golf at both the University of Arizona and San Diego State University. “I clearly had no interest in him but they thought I did. I think that’s what it ended up being, who knows,” she continued. “Then I deleted that account and went by my middle name so they couldn’t find me. I wanted to be really private and I only posted golf videos because nobody could make fun of golf videos. So that’s how I got Paige Renee.” When her social media following soared, Spiranac explained that she went back and forth with using her middle name, because she was competing in golf tournaments as Paige Spiranac. But in the end, she said, “It just continued like that” and she kept her name as  Paige Renee on Instagram.
