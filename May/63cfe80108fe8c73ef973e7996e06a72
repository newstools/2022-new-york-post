Quality accessories can transform an outfit from plain to amazing with just a few key pieces — whether that be a fun pair of sneakers, a denim jacket, tote bag, jewelry (perhaps from BaubleBar’s 20% Spring Sale) or trendy, oversized sunglasses. Not only do sunglasses help protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, but they can complete just about any daytime outfit. Whether you’re looking for a classic aviator pick, cat-eye frames, circle framed sunnies or other oversized options, we’ve got you covered. Our list features options from Amazon, DIFF Eyewear, Quay, J. Crew and more. These Celine-dupe sunnies from Amazon are not only polarized but cost less than $20 too! Grab them in black, brown or a handful of other hues, too. Quay’s bestselling High Key sunglasses are a great unisex pair that would look great on just about anyone and can be accessorized with any outfit. Grab the SOJOS square metal frame sunglasses for just $16 on Amazon. Available in almost 10 different lens colors. For days when you want to keep things simple, throw on a pair of the DIFF Carson frames to step up your go-to uniform. Available in 12 patterns and colors. These Feisedy retro sunnies have a whopping 2,200+ Amazon reviews and cost less than $20 — what’s not to love? For a hybrid take on aviators and cat-eye lenses, consider trying out Quay’s Sweet Dreams sunglasses. They come in various tortoise patterns and basic black, too. We love this round aviator pick from DIFF that gives supermodel vibes no matter what shade you choose to buy it in. For a pop of color to wear at the beach or on your next lunch date, go for the J. Crew Cabana Oversized Sunglasses that are currently on sale for just $40! For more recommendations, check out the New York Post Shopping section.
