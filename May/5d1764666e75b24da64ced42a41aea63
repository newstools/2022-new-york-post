Olivia Rodrigo was living her best life Thursday, rocking out to her own music at Citizens Bank Park, where the Phillies suffered a heartbreaking 8-7 loss to the Mets. The 19-year-old singer, who sat in a private suite with her friends and entourage, rocked out to her hit song, “Good 4 U,” when the home team introduced her on the big screen. Rodrigo was seen smiling as she danced to the upbeat track, which was nominated for “Best Music Video” at the 2022 Grammy Awards last month. Other fans in attendance were having a good time as well — until the ninth inning. That’s when the brutal Phillies bullpen coughed up a 7-1 lead to the Mets and turned it into an 8-7 defeat. Rodrigo is in Philadelphia for the weekend as she has two back-to-back, sold-out shows on Friday and Saturday as part of her “Sour Tour,” in support of her debut studio album. Rodrigo’s tour heads overseas to Europe between June 11 and July 7 this summer.
