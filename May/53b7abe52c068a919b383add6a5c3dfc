Make way for the king of performance shoes, as Allbirds is here — and the brand is brining their newest launch with them. On May 5, the shoe brand announced its latest running shoe, the Tree Flyer ($160). As of May 17, it is officially available to shop, and we are sprinting to the brand’s website to get our hands on a pair. This all new Allbirds style is lighter, can go further and introduces brand new midsole innovation called SwiftFoam. The SwiftFoam is 30% lighter than the brands SweetFoam, has increased cushioning and returns energy with a rebound of 70 percent. How do we know this? Because Allbirds took over a year to test this shoe on over 130 runners and more than 4,000 miles. The shoe also features a flared external heel for support, an increased toe spring, a traction pattern on the sole, reflective eye-stays, flat laces and a lightweight, breathable eucalyptus fiber upper that provides next-level comfort. The Tree Flyer is available in beige, yellow, orange, black and white. Best of all, it’s available in both men’s and women’s sizes. Men’s Allbirds Tree Flyer sizes run from 7 to 14 including half sizes. Women’s sizes run from 5 to 11 including half sizes. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
