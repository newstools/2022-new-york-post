A Texas senator says it is “destructive” and “unfair” to blame local cops for the delayed response to the tragic Texas school shooting that left 21 dead, including 19 kids. “The second-guessing and finger-pointing among state and local law enforcement is destructive, distracting and unfair,” Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Complex scenarios require split-second decisions. Easy to criticize with 20-20 hindsight,” he said. In a follow-up tweet Saturday, Cronyn replied to a commenter who took issue with the “horrendous misjudgment” by police. “My only point we need a thorough investigation to nail down facts before reaching a conclusion,” Cronyn responded. “Accountability should follow.” The US Department of Justice announced Sunday it will conduct an independent probe of the police response, which has come under increasing fire after cops waited more than 70 minutes before storming the classrooms where gunman Salvador Ramos killed his victims. Ramos, 18, was later gunned down by police — but only after the slaughter. Critics noted that local, school, county and state police failed to move in on Ramos despite frantic 911 calls from doomed youngsters in the school and the pleas of desperate parents outside the building who begged officers to go in.
