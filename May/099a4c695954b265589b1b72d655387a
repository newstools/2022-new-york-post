Your iPhone comes with a clever feature that can help you screenshot more efficiently – here’s how to access it. The useful tip was shared in a 13-second TikTok video by a user named Shirley. The creator began the video by noting: “I was today years old when I found out you could screenshot an entire page, look.” She then opened up a webpage on Safari and screenshotted it. Once the screenshot appeared at the bottom left corner of her screen, she tapped on it. Shortly afterward, the image opened and two options appeared at the top of her screen: Screen and full page. Shirley tapped on Full Page and then went down the entire page via a scroller on the right side of the screen. In the end, she was presented with the option to either delete the screenshot or save the entire page as a PDF. If users tap on ‘save the entire page’, it does just that. Since the handy tip has gone live, it has received more than 600,000 likes and 12,000 comments. Many of the users in the comments section expressed disbelief and awe at the simple hack. “I USED TO TAKE LIKE 20 SCREENSHOTS,” one user commented. “Bruh it was right there the entire time too,” a second TikToker remarked. “OMG, it’s true! Why was I not told about this before?” a third commenter said. A fourth user helpfully noted that “this only works on Safari, not on other web-browsing apps like Google, Chrome, Firefox, etc.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
