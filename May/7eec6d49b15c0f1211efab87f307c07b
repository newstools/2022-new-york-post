When sisters Nicky and Simone Zimmermann co-founded their Sydney-based design house in 1991, they had no idea it would turn into one of the most stylish brands in the world — beloved by A-listers like Beyoncé, Kate Middleton, Kendall Jenner and Margot Robbie. What started as a simple swimwear and casual resort line has bloomed into a worldwide empire, complete with runway shows and stores throughout the United States, Australia and Europe. The label’s easy-breezy, feminine sophistication, mixed with bright hues and playful prints, oozes summer fun and has proved to be catnip for the elevated beach set. Zimmermann will open its seventh New York shop next month in Southampton, a sister store to its East Hampton outpost, which is already a local favorite. Here, Nicky Zimmermann shares her sleek — and oh-so chic — picks for summer.
