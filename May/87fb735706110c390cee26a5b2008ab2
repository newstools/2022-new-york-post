Vice President Kamala Harris is supposedly the White House point on the border surge, but the issue has vanished from her schedule, the Los Angeles Times reports; she hasn’t hosted an immigration event in nine months. This, though April saw a record 234,088 migrants apprehended at the southern border. Team Biden released 110,000 of those migrants into the interior, and you can add the many thousands who never got caught to that total. And “root causes” Harris has stopped pretending to do anything about it, after a few Central American photo-ops and blank “do not come” appeals. (Her press secretary lamely insists she’s still on it.) Despite the issue being at the top of the list of crises facing the country, it’s obvious no one in the White House wants to touch the growing disaster. After all, the real Biden approach here is “let ’em in,” and who wants accountability for the inevitable results?
