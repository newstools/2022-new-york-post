If you can’t swat them, drone them. One community in northern Louisiana has deployed drones to combat out-of-control mosquito populations. The Caddo Parish Animal Services and Mosquito Control is responsible for mosquito control over a 900-square-mile area. This year they have deployed drones to spray insecticide into the region’s more hard-to-reach locations. “We are excited about being able to treat mosquitoes in the parish in areas that we haven’t been able to treat before,” said Caddo Mosquito Control Manager Brian Glascock. “We are able to fly the drone over these areas and drop larvicide, hitting the mosquito larvae before they become adults.” West Nile Virus, a potentially deadly disease carried by mosquitos, remains an issue in Louisiana. Mosquito samples from Caddo Parish are sent daily to Louisiana State University for testing. With Post Wires
