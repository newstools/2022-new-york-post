A 25-year-old missing man was found dead after being shot, stabbed and burned in Philadelphia on May 4, according to local reports. Francis Decero, of Philadelphia, was found dead after police received a report of a body in a bush near South 31st and Tasker streets in South Philadelphia, according to Fox 29. Cops said Decero, who was reported missing on April 26, was found shot, stabbed, beaten, and burned. Investigators obtained surveillance footage that shows when Decero was last seen double parking a Jeep before getting into another car that drove off. Family members found the Jeep out of gas, but there was no sign of Decero in the vehicle as they desperately continued searching for him. After Decero was found dead, a candle lighting and balloon release were held in his honor by family and friends. “It all feels like a bad dream… At least we aren’t waiting around for him to walk through the door anymore,” said Decero’s sister in-law, Tara Persing. “Frankie left an imprint with everyone he came into contact with. He’s going to be missed by so many.” Police said an investigation is ongoing.
