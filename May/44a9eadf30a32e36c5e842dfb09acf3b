It wasn’t a strikeout or weak contact, but it was one at-bat Yankees prospect Anthony Seigler would like to forget. The 2018 first-round pick thought he had gone deep in the 10th inning for the Single-A Hudson Valley Renegades Saturday night and celebrated with a bat flip. The only problem was the ball didn’t leave the yard, and Seigler was thrown out at second base to end the game, a 6-2 loss. When Seigler, a 22-year-old catcher, realized the ball didn’t go out, he tried to turn it on, but he was thrown out at second base. Seigler is having a strong season in the minors. Entering Sunday he was batting .266 with an .880 OPS across 30 games, 25 of which came with Single-A Tampa. He made up for the mistake by hitting a two-run home run on Sunday.
