Eric Reed, the trainer of Rich Strike, the horse who improbably won the Kentucky Derby as an 80-1 long shot, was asked about a derogatory tweet he was alleged to have sent about Vice President Kamala Harris. In January, Sebastian Gorka, a former advisor to President Trump, asked, “So what exactly are Kamala’s qualifications?” An account whose handle is @daddyrabbit1964 and went by the name of Eric Reed responded, “Heard she’s good on her knees!!” Reed appeared on ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” on Wednesday, and John Barr asked him if he sent that tweet. “I haven’t seen anything about it,” Reed answered. “Haven’t been told about it. I don’t know what’s going on out there. I’m more concerned with Richie and what’s going on with us, and this great horse, and how much he’s helping everybody. So, there’s haters out there, and that’s about how I’m gonna leave something like that.” In summation: this answer could neither be construed as a confirmation, nor denial. The @daddyrabbit1964 Twitter account is currently private. The bio on the account says, “Horse trainer and Reagan conservative. Fantasy Football fanatic, Owner of Mercury Equine Center.” The Mercury Equine Center is the home track of Rich Strike.
