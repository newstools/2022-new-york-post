A three-story townhouse in uptown Manhattan that has been described as “vivid,” “funky” and full of color has hit the market for $3.9 million. Located in the historic Harlem enclave of Hamilton Heights, at 40 Hamilton Terrace, the property last sold in 2005 for $1.1 million. “This magnificent example of majestic turn of the century architecture by Henri Fouchaux is one of the lucky homes to have preserved the elegant wood work,” the listing notes. Made up of five bedrooms and six full baths, the home spans 4,100 square feet. Features include a parlor floor entry, a full dining room, decorative fireplaces and a kitchen that overlooks the planted garden with a deck. The garden floor of this home boasts a separate one-bedroom apartment with a kitchen and two bathrooms, accessible both from the exterior front garden and the interior staircase, according to the listing. On the second floor is a primary suite with a bay window, a sitting area and a traditional dressing room. There is also a second bathroom. The third floor has two more bedrooms and bathrooms, including a room with a skylight, plus a washer/dryer. Built in 1899, the home stands on the same street as New York Post founder, and founding father, Alexander Hamilton’s Hamilton Grange country house built in 1802.
