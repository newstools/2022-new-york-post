Apparently, you can’t supersize love. A man’s failed marriage proposal in a McDonald’s in South Africa has social media reeling after it went horribly awry. He was brutally rejected in the middle of the restaurant by an unnamed woman, who appeared stunned by his question. She shared a look of shock with employees behind the counter while fellow customers can be heard attempting to sway her decision to say yes — before ultimately shaking her head at the man on one knee. As the mortifying footage drags on, she appears to exchange heated words with the jilted man, then storms out while surrounded by a chorus of boos. The clip, which has racked up 3.7 million views on Twitter, also captures the man standing up and claiming his McDonald’s order before leaving the crowded restaurant. “Witnessed such a sad situation today,” the tweet read. People replying to the viral clip were quick to crack jokes — “She sad Mc-No,” one person quipped — while others judged the man’s choice of location. “Proposing in public seems so manipulative to me, cuz if she rejects you she’s the villain even though you put her on the spot,” wrote one critic. “If u propose to ur gf in front of a McDonald’s u definitely deserve to be rejected,” added another. Meanwhile, eagle-eyed skeptics were quick to spot a wedding band already on the man’s finger, questioning if the public display of affection was even real, or just a stunt for social media. “Why is this man already wearing a wedding band?” asked one viewer. “Wait, is this man trying to take a second wife?… I see a ring,” commented another. Footage of the man’s misfortune garnered an additional 182,000 likes on TikTok, where many users were lovin’ it. “I wanna see what happened from the cashier’s view,” joked one user. “It’s the cashier recording on his phone for me,” chimed another.
