He’s really gonna do it. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that he is running for Congress in a new district straddling Manhattan and Brooklyn. “I’m declaring my candidacy for Congress in the 10th congressional district in New York,” the failed 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told MSNBC Friday morning. “Polls show people are hurting, they need help, they need help fast, they need leaders that can actually get them help now,” de Blasio added. “I know how to do it from years of serving the people of this city.” The announcement comes two days after the Post reported on his interest in the newly-created district that includes lower Manhattan, parts of Brownstone Brooklyn and Borough Park. Court-appointed special master Jonathan Cervas created the new district after the state’s highest court invalidated the so-called “Hochulmander” approved by Albany Democrats. Incumbent Rep. Jerrold Nadler’s current district heavily overlaps with the 10th District, but Nadler has chosen to take on fellow Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney in the new 12th District, which includes Nadler’s longtime powerbase on the Upper West Side. A litany of potential candidates are expected to announce their own plans about running against de Blasio in the coming days.
