RIP the Jarrett Stidham era in New England – we barely knew ye. The Patriots agreed to trade the former Auburn quarterback – who was briefly floated as a real possibility to replace Tom Brady in 2020 – to the Raiders, according to several reports. Las Vegas agreed to a pick swap, sending a sixth-round pick in 2023 for New England’s seventh-rounder. The trade would reunite Stidham with former Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who became the Raiders’ head coach this offseason. With Derek Carr firmly entrenched as the starter in Las Vegas, Stidham figures to compete with Garrett Gilbert, whom the team also signed this offseason, for the backup job. Stidham was taken in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft and spent his rookie season as Tom Brady’s primary backup. There was chatter that he would take over as the starter when Brady took his talents to Tampa Bay, but the team eventually signed Cam Newton late into that offseason, relegating him to a backup role. Mac Jones is now entrenched as the starter, and New England drafted Bailey Zappe from Western Kentucky in the 2022 Draft, making Stidham expendable. Throughout his career, Stidham has completed 24 of 48 pass attempts for 270 yards, two touchdowns and four interceptions.
