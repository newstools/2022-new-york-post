Here comes a migration of Ravens to New York. The Giants are expected to sign Maurice Canady, according to a source, and have inked Khalil Dorsey, according to his agency. Both cornerbacks previously played for the Ravens under new Giants defensive coordinator Wink Martindale. So, to no surprise, it appears the salary-cap-strapped Giants’ plan for replacing top cornerback James Bradberry is to hunt for bargains who have the advantage of familiarity with the defensive scheme. Bradberry was released last week for $10.1 million in savings needed to sign the 11-pick draft class. Canady, 27, is a veteran of 40 games, including four starts, during an injury-plagued six-year career. Originally drafted in the sixth round by the Ravens, Canady was in Chicago Bears rookie minicamp (veteran exemption) as a tryout earlier this month. The Bears passed, but the Giants bit after Canady worked out for evaluators Tuesday, according to NorthJersey.com. After signing with the Dallas Cowboys, Canady opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19. He played eight games last season but missed the bulk of the second half due to a concussion. Canady’s lone career interception came with the Ravens in 2019. He finished that season playing for the Jets, who claimed him off waivers in November. Dorsey, 24, played six games with a bigger role on special teams than defense for the Ravens as an undrafted rookie in 2020 before a season-ending shoulder injury. He re-injured the shoulder last August and missed the entire season. The Giants are searching for cornerbacks with experience playing the boundary. Adoree’ Jackson will start on one side of the field, and the Giants’ top three youngsters – Darnay Holmes, Aaron Robinson and rookie Cor’Dale Flott – all are more experienced in the slot. Robinson is expected to move to the perimeter.
