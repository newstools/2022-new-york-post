Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty brand exists to breakdown the unrealistic standards of perfection — and we’re obsessed. Since the brand’s 2020 launch, it has extended into the face, lip, eyes and tool categories, ensuring there is something for everyone. And we mean everyone, as the brand houses 48 various foundation and concealer shades, a plethora of different lip products, sharp eyeliner and more.

That’s why we are so excited that Rare Beauty is offering a free full-size Liquid Touch Brightening Concealer ($19) with purchase of Liquid Touch Weightless Foundation ($29) from May 27 to May 30 with code CONCEAL. To add both the foundation and concealer to your bag, it would typically be a total of $48, but this Memorial Day deal will only cost you $29. To shop this incredible Rare Beauty Memorial Day find, all you have to do is find your foundation and concealer shade below, add them to your cart, use the promo code CONCEAL and watch your total price go down. The Liquid Touch Weightless Foundation comes in light to deep tones that glide onto your face. It’s dries down to a skin-like finish, is breathable, smooths the look of pores and offers medium coverage. The Liquid Touch Brightening Concealer is just as good as the foundation. It’s hides blemishes, dark circles, redness, fine lines and offers buildable coverage. It’s creamy, hydrating, sweat-resistant and long-wearing. But best of all, it offers a radiant finish.
