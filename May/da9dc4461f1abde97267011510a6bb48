Two would-be art thieves tried to snatch a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting from a Chelsea gallery earlier this month, police said. The attempted heist happened at Taglialatella Galleries on the evening of May 14, the NYPD announced Wednesday. The suspects — a young man and woman with  European accents — entered the 10th Avenue showcase just before 5:30 p.m. and tried to swipe the unidentified Basquiat, police said. The NYPD valued the work at $45,000. Paintings by the late Manhattan street artist and counter-culture icon routinely sell for eight figures, and one of his works fetched a record $110 million at a 2017 auction. The gallery’s Jean-Michel Basquiat: King Pleasure exhibition is touted as “a retrospective of Basquiat’s work organized by his sisters and featuring over 200 never-before-seen pieces,” by the curators. The two suspects were last seen walking away from the gallery empty-handed, security footage showed.
