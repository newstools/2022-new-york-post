President Biden urged students at the University of Delaware not to lose hope in America and take up a life of public service. “We need all of you to get engaged in public life and the life of this nation,” Biden told graduates of the school in a commencement address. “There’s one message I hope you take from me today: This is no time to be on the sidelines. It’s not hyperbole. I mean it from the bottom of my heart.” Biden himself graduated from the school back in 1965 when he said tuition cost just $300 per year. He has spoken at graduations there throughout his political career, including 1978, 1987, 2004 and 2014. Biden also reflected on the shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas. “Let’s be clear, evil came to that elementary school classroom in Texas and that grocery store in New York,” Biden said. “We cannot outlaw tragedy, I know, but we can make America safer.”
