Diamondbacks pitcher Madison Bumgarner had to be restrained by teammates after he was ejected after one inning in a hectic scene. Facing the Marlins’ Garrett Cooper in the first inning, Bumgarner threw what he thought would be called strike three and began walking toward the dugout, but the pitch was instead called a ball. It did appear to be slightly off the plate, but the 32-year-old disagreed. After the inning was over, Bumgarner was walking toward the mound when first base umpire Dan Bellino – not the home plate umpire, with whom he took issue with on the call – asked for a sticky-substance check. Bumgarner, clearly annoyed, appeared to exchange words with Bellino. Then, as Bumgarner was walking back to the dugout, he appeared to say something else – which is what prompted the umpire to eject him from the game. Bumgarner was so enraged that he had to be physically restrained as he tried to walk towards Bellino. It did not appear that the ejection was due to any sort of substance on his hand, which was checked before the words were exchanged. Many seemed to believe Bellino instigated the pitcher, including Diamondbacks executive and former Major Leaguer Dan Haren. “Was completely instigated by Dan Bellino, was staring at Bum until he looked at Bellino in the eyes,” Haren tweeted. “Wanted to throw him out. He was targeted, Bellino needs to be disciplined. Complete BS.”
