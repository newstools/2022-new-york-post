A cheeky cat is hard to spot hiding among the plants at a garden center. Max’s owner shared a snap of him having a rest between the flower pots – can you find his hiding place? The image shows a small part of a garden center, where there are plants and pots on the ground, alongside some buckets and other tools. There are also some flowers on the shelf in the right side of the picture. Max’s owner, the manager of a family business in South Carolina, shared the confusing image on Twitter. It left users puzzled, looking everywhere for the hidden pet. The caption read: “It’s a gorgeous day in Charleston (maybe our last for a few months) and Max is happily hiding in the garden center. “Do you see him?” One commented: “Max! Stay hydrated.” While another one said: “All right! Where is he?????” The owner then shared a close-up image of Max who is comfortably enjoying a sunny day inside a basket.
