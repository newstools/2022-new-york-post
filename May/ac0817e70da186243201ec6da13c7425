A cheeky cat has hidden herself among these chainsaws in the hardware store. The mischievous moggy has taken a fancy to the spot on the shelf – but can you spot her? The owners of East Bay Hardware in Charleston, South Carolina tweeted a picture of their store saying they “carry gas and battery operated…products and accessories”. “We also have a hidden Emma,” they said but left people to guess where she’s hiding. The picture has sent Twitter crazy and racked up more than 65,000 likes after it was shared on the ‘There is not cat in this image’ account. It has also prompted a slew of terrible puns based on her being in the section where the shop sells Stihl products. Owners of the store, have two permanent employees, their cats, Emma and Max. Merissa Ellis, whose mother owns the store, regularly finds the cats tucked away in corners of the shop and shares photos to their Twitter page @eastbayhardware. For those struggling to find Emma, look down the bottom right where she’s sitting on the shelf, tucked away behind a chainsaw. It comes after Max hid himself among the plants at a store’s garden center Merissa shared a snap of him having a rest between the flower pots. An image shows a small part of a garden center, where there are plants and pots on the ground, alongside some buckets and other tools. There are also some flowers on the shelf in the right side of the picture. It left users puzzled, looking everywhere for the hidden pet. Merissa then shared a close up image of Max who is comfortably enjoying a sunny day inside a basket. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
