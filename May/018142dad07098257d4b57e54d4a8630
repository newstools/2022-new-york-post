The grieving wife of slain Queens food delivery worker Zhiwen Yan made a tearful plea for justice on Wednesday at a candlelight vigil near the Chinese restaurant where he worked. Yan was gunned down while making deliveries for Great Wall Chinese in plush Forest Hills on April 30, but the killer remains on the street while the family is “tortured” by sorrow and fear, wife Kunying Zhao said. “New York City, you owe me a life … you owe me a husband … you owe an explanation to the Chinese community,” Zhao said through an interpreter to those gathered at the vigil, held in a parking lot in front of the restaurant. “I want to know why since last November his boss and colleagues have been threatened multiple times and nobody could protect them. I want to know why!” Yan, 45, was shot while riding his delivery scooter near 108th Street and 67th Drive around 9:30 p.m. and cops are eyeing as a suspect a disgruntled customer who had allegedly vandalized the eatery and menaced employees with a gun. “I want the law enforcement to do their job as quickly as possible, and arrest the killer and prosecute him,” Zhao said in an impassioned 10-minute where she expressed frustration on the case. “I hope that justice can be done so that my husband can rest in peace.” Dozens gathered at the vigil, locking arms in solidarity while chanting “we need justice” for Yan, who had worked for the restaurant for nearly 10 years. He had emigrated from China two decades ago and left behind three kids ages 2, 12 and 14. The delivery man worked long hours to provide a better life for his family, Zhao said, adding that he embodied a hard-working spirit and deserved a better fate. “He was only 45 years old. He should have been able to watch his children grow up, but everything ended,” Zhao said. “The criminal, the killer used one bullet — brutally ended his life.”
