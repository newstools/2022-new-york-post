The Post’s Joseph Staszewski will be bringing you around the world of professional wrestling every Tuesday in his weekly column, the Post Match Angle. There is still a gaping hole to fill in Roman Reigns’ résumé as he ascends into the realm of the all-time greats in pro wrestling history. The Tribal Chief is still without a legendary rivalry, the contemporary that truly brings out the best in him and vice versa. There was “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and The Rock. Shawn Michaels with Bret Hart and the Undertaker. Ric Flair with Ricky Steamboat and Sting. Hulk Hogan has Andre The Giant and Roddy Piper. John Cena had Randy Orton, Edge and CM Punk. Roman Reigns? You can make the case for Brock Lesnar, with whom he has main evented WrestleMania three times. But there are plenty of holes to poke into that theory. One, Seth Rollins’ cash-in is all people remember from WrestleMania 31. Their second meeting at WrestleMania 34 was during an era where babyface Reigns was still getting rejected by the WWE audience. The most recent run will likely be remembered for the new farmer/cowboy version of babyface Lesnar and the match – billed as the biggest in WrestleMania history – not really living up for the hype. After that, Triple H, Braun Stroman and Bray Wyatt ,,, maybe John Cena? There is still plenty of time to make this happen and plenty of candidates since Reigns is just 36 and in the prime of his career. Reigns – 600-plus-days as Universal champion and seven WrestleMania main events aside – needs to find that all-time rivalry and signature match for his career to connect on that special level few in the industry have reached. Lucky for him there are three prime candidates currently on the WWE roster and one maybe waiting in the wings. Whoever the company eventually decides to take the belts from him will have the best chance, but nothing is guaranteed. Rollins currently has a great chance to be the performer Reigns will be forever linked with. The two have the deepest backstory dating back to their time in The Shield and Reigns has never gotten the better of Rollins in the big moment. Their short program leading up to their match at this year’s Royal Rumble was excellent theater. Rollins won by DQ after a heavily frustrated Reigns delivered a receipt for the chair shot Seth delivered to him to break up The Shield. No one eats at the soul of The Head of the Table more than Rollins. They just need more one-on-one interactions. Drew McIntyre may be the next of WWE’s big stars to get a crack at Reigns. The two will be part of the six-man tag at WrestleMania Backlash on Sunday. The Scotsman, because of his true babyface status and ability to thrive in the main event spot, certainly has a chance to turn into Reigns’ all-time rival. The two already have the backstory of McIntyre coming ever so close to beating Reigns at the 2020 Survivor Series. While he will be getting a late start, you have to include Cody Rhodes in that conversation. Rhodes was stuck in the mid-card while Reigns was being put in the main event spot the American Nightmare longed for. Rhodes left, went out to break all the rules and challenged many of the things WWE stood for on the independent scene (something Reigns never had to do) and AEW before triumphantly returning to declare himself the best wrestler in the world. What better way to prove that than to beat the guy who claims to be and is recognized by many as that, the guy who embodies everything WWE stands for that Rhodes rebelled against for so long? It’s going to take some time to get there with Rhodes, as it would someone like a Bron Brakker from NXT. He would put Reigns more in the role Lesnar and John Cena were for him. Reigns’ run and some short programs have been mostly a joy so far. For his story to stay fresh and his legacy to truly reach the pantheon, WWE needs to find his all-time foil – his Rock, his Shawn Michaels, his Steamboat. Anything less will leave this Reigns’ run incomplete. All Elite Wrestling’s hot-potato treatment of the TNT championship to complete the double-turn of Sammy Guevara and Scorpio Sky seemed to work with Sky getting a big pop as he won the ladder match on Dynamite to reclaim the gold. Attractive and talented guy (Guevara) with his attractive and talented girlfriend (Tay Conti) will always get heat in pro wrestling. I never like the idea of having a title changing hands six times in the past six months and three times in a little more than month, but give Sky a long reign now and I can live with it. (Also, Guevara pretty much no-selling a fall off a ladder onto a barbed-wire ladder during the match felt so unrealistic. But maybe it makes the audience hate him more?) What all of it has created for AEW is the hard road to any match involving former UFC fighter Paige VanZant, who signed with the company in March. VanZant being an outsider, her Instagram fame and lack of UFC success makes her feel like a more natural heel to a wrestling audience. She had been treated as such even prior to her official arrival during her interactions with Chris Jericho’s Inner Circle faction. If Tony Khan and AEW plan to have her make her in-ring debut at the “Double or Nothing” pay-per-view in Las Vegas on May 29, the company has a short time to try to endear her to the audience and make her and Conti feel like more than accessories to Guevara and Sky’s feud. VanZant will quickly need to make a sincere connection with the audience. Maybe the rub from the dynamic Guevara and Sky have created will be enough to get the desired crowd reaction for either a singles match with Conti or a mix-tag match (Conti and Guevara did just win the AAA mixed tag championships over the weekend in Mexico.) It’s time for AEW to start taking advantage of the reach of VanZant’s celebrity (3.1 million Instagram followers) to get the level of promotion and attention that could come with it. They possibly just made it a little harder on themselves by turning her babyface this soon. Going nowhere with Shinsuke Nakamura’s faceoff with Roman Reigns and WWE changing the anticipated tag team title unification match at Backlash into a meaningless six-man tag is just another example of the frustration that can come with watching its product. The company did weeks worth of story to set up a fascinating Usos vs. RK-Bro clash that truly could have gone either way. Instead of paying it off and showcasing tag team wrestling and the further unification of titles, WWE used it as a vehicle to get the Reigns-McIntyre feud going at the contract signing, shoehorn them into the match and – for now — removing all stakes. It took a unique, winner-take-all match off a card that otherwise feels like WrestleMania Rematch, all while dropping a potential Reigns-Nakamura match cold. At least WWE acknowledged the absurdity of having on-screen official Adam Pearce initially push back against the change before making it. There’s some Kevin Nash cool and early Diezel unstoppable athleticism in Wardlow, but how many times are we going to see MJF bring in people to fight his next opponent in matches we will know they’ll win. That said, couldn’t be happier for fellow Queens guy William Morrissey, aka Big Cass, likely  getting back on national TV next week versus Wardlow after turning his life around. He opens up about his story in a really good listen on Renee Paquette’s “The Sessions” podcast this week. Natayla probably doesn’t get enough credit for how much she helps in the development of WWE women’s wrestlers in the ring on and off screen. Her NXT storyline with Cora Jade, Lash Legend and Nikka Lyons is just another example of the importance of having that veteran presence. Finn Balor potentially teaming with former Bullet Club leader A.J. Styles in some capacity against Edge and Damian Priest is probably the best thing that could happen to him considering WWE’s refusal to give him a meaningful single push. If you haven’t seen Shane Mercer’s highlights yet, take the time. Kudos to Dakota Kai and Malcolm Biven for reportedly betting on themselves and not planning to re-sign with WWE even before being released. Two very talented people who will make an impact wherever they land. The Baddies and the Baddies Section is such a great addition to Jade Cargill’s presentation. Kierra Hogan and Red Velvet give her a new way to get heat and it promotes powerful women in a way a lot of the female audience can get behind. Liv Morgan pinning Sonya Deville to win the Raw main event was so needed after some of her recent losses. Also the pure joy on Bianca Belair’s face hugging Morgan made the moment that much better. It is me or does Ezekiel’s outfits like a cross between the Ultimate Warrior and the Macho Man or something you’ll find under Default Player 5 in WWE 2K22? The Beat the Clock Challenge – without any stakes — remains one of the least beneficial booking devices used by WWE. Dak Harwood and Cash Wheeler gave us a fitting love letter to the Hart family and a match that lived up to everything. Kudos gentleman. (Bonus: Big stretch of wrestling in NYC coming. WWE is a Nassau Coliseum for SmackDown on Friday and AEW heads to USB Arena for Dynamite next Wednesday. See you there?) Scorpio Sky, AEW Sky defeated Sammy Guevara in an excellent ladder match on Dynamite to complete a successful double turn to a babyface and become a two-time TNT champion. The sky is the limit for Scorpio right now. Charlotte Flair (c.) vs. Ronda Rousey, SmackDown women’s’ championship (Sunday, 8 p.m., Peacock) Flair and Rousey seemed destined for an “I Quit” match from the start of their second act and this will be the overall rubber match between them. Can two of the best female performers WWE has to offer end this portion of their story, which has gotten mixed reviews, on a high note? WWE should make this the main event Sunday and loser could be out of the title picture for some time. Honorable mention: Cameron Grimes vs. Carmelo Hayes vs. Solo Sikoa for the NXT North American championship (Tuesday, 8 p.m., USA Network); Deonna Purrazzo vs Mercedes Martinez for the ROH women’s championship (Wednesday, 8 p.m., TBS). Cody Rhodes will be Steve Austin’s next guest on “The Broken Skull Sessions.” It will be available on Peacock starting Friday. The IInspiration, formerly the IIconics in WWE, announced they are stepping away from wrestling for the time being. Cassie Lee and Jessie McKay had been wrestling with Impact and have had great success with their BrandArmy site. AEW’s Daniel Garcia defeated Bandido to become the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla world champion at the “Delivering the Goods” event on Sunday. It ended Bandido’s 864-day reign. Juice Robison made a surprise return to New Japan Pro Wrestling, joined Bullet Club and looks to be in line for a IWGP United States title program after attacking champion Hiroshi Tanahashi last week. This could mean Robinson, who is engaged to Toni Storm, in line for some appearances in AEW or the Forbidden Door pay-per-view. Game Changer Wrestling announced a return to the Hammerstein Ballroom on June 18th for “You Wouldn’t Understand).
