This optical illusion featuring an elephant could reveal just how good your eyesight really is. The hidden image of the animal can reportedly only be spotted by one percent of people – but fear not as there’s a helpful trick to help you. The mind-boggling image was shared by TikTok star Hectic Nick as he challenged viewers to solve the illusion. Posting the illusion he said: “Only one percent of people can find the hidden elephant in this image. “It’s not easy, but try flipping your phone over and you might be able to find it. “Send this to a friend and see what they do.” The image left viewers in the comments baffled as they struggled to find the animal in the inverted image. But finally, the penny dropped that the elephant was lurking in the foreground with the two large trees acting as its legs and the smaller tree as its trunk. One frustrated user wrote: “I took ten hours to find this.” Another penned: “It’s the trees.” While a third brazen person added: “Saw it without having to flip. I guess I’m in the one percent.” Meanwhile, viewers were challenged to find the crown in a busy brainteaser. It comes ahead of the highly anticipated Jubilee celebrations starting next week.
