Anna Horford, the sister of Celtics star Al Horford, has continued her war of words with the city of Philadelphia and its sports fans. When Al was traded away from the Sixers in 2020, his sister tweeted that those fans were the “most miserable” in the NBA, and said, “Some of you guys were cool, but to the rest, f–k off.” With Al currently excelling in his role for the Celtics, and Boston on the cusp of reaching this year’s NBA Finals, Anna shined a light Thursday on her brother. “Al doesn’t care about individual recognition, but I would love to see him to get his flowers. His consistency & leadership has propelled this team,” she tweeted. “At almost 36, he’s proven to be invaluable to the Cs. Just bc he’s quiet about his success, doesn’t mean it should be glossed over.” When a Sixers fan responded that Anna’s brother was a “flaming hot pile of garbage in Philadelphia”, she pointed the finger back around. “Maybe your city should start trying to love & inspire their players instead of trashing them & their families. You guys have been home for a while now… Enjoy your vacation & regroup,” she tweeted. The old “scoreboard” argument is hard to rebut right now, and Sixers fans will have to wait until next year to try to reclaim it. The Celtics hold a 3-2 lead in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Heat and will host Miami for Game 6 on Friday night.
