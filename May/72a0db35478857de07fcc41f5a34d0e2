Australian voters ended nine years of conservative rule in the country’s national elections Saturday, ousting Prime Minister Scott Morrison in favor of the center left Labor Party leader  Anthony Albanese,  who has campaigned on promises to take tough action on climate change. Early results showed the Labor Party winning 72 of the 76 seats needed to form a government as Morrison conceded defeat in the Liberal-National Coalition that he has led since 2018. Albanese, 59, known as “Albo,” campaigned on improving free healthcare and advocating for the LGBT community. He credits his progressive politics with being raised by a single mother on disability in public housing. “Tonight, the Australian people have voted for change,” Albanese said in his victory speech in Sydney. He continued: “It says a lot about our great country that the son of a single mom who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing down the road in Camperdown, can stand before you tonight as Australia’s prime minister.”
