This airplane creep is toe-tally out of line. Social media siren Alina Bedrossian sent TikTok into a tizzy with footage exposing a man seated next to her on a Delta flight for brazenly snapping and editing pictures of her feet without permission. “WTF am I supposed to say,” questioned Bedrossian, 23, in the caption of her viral video, which has amassed over 4.9 million views. In the clip, the Atlanta bombshell secretly records the unidentified foot fanatic, wearing what appears to be a black cap and a gray sweatshirt, as he angles his iPhone toward her tootsies and takes a pic. He then opens his photo gallery to the image of Bedrossian’s feet, which were clad in golden open-toe sandals. Bedrossian edited the clip with ominous music and voiceover audio of a person saying “the woman was too stunned to speak” in her off-putting post. Delta Airlines did not respond to The Post’s request for comment. But concerned commentators quickly jumped in with hot takes on how she should have handled the foot felon. “[I would] call over an attendant and loudly be like, ‘HEY THIS GUY KEEPS TAKING PICS OF MY FEET CAN I HAVE A DIFFERENT SEAT PLS,’” advised one online onlooker. “I would have said, ‘Pay me and I won’t tell,’ ” argued another. In a separate share, Bedrossian revealed that after capturing a shot of her shoes, the hoof admirer unabashedly photoshopped the picture to his liking right in front of her. “Bro didn’t even hide,” laughed a commenter. “My man took a pic, edited it right next you and u still said nothing!” another viewer rebuked. Bedrossian did not respond to The Post’s request for comment, nor did she publicly confirm whether she reported the airplane perp to Delta or the proper authorities. She did, however, announce that the foot fiasco didn’t foul up her flying experience. “Eh, the rest of the trip was nice and fun,” Bedrossian assured in the caption of a clip, featuring her dog — and her feet.
