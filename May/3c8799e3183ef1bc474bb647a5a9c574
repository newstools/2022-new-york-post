An up-and-coming teenage rapper was shot dead in Washington, DC Thursday morning while he was shooting a music video. Justin Johnson, 16, who performs under the name 23 Rackz, was found shot in the Southeast section of the district just before 11:30 a.m., according to WTTG-TV. The Temple Hills, Maryland “Hook” artist released an album entitled “Rookie of the Year” in 2021 and was considered part of the DMV rap genre, a regional percussion-heavy style pioneered in DC, Maryland and Virginia. Moments before Johnson was gunned down, he posted an Instagram story that shared his location, according to a YouTube account that specializes in drill rap content. Police were reportedly offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the teen’s killer.
