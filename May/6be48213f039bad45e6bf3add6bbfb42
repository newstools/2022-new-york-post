Three people were shot and a man was attacked with a wrench on the subway in the final hours of Memorial Day weekend in New York City. A teenager walked into Harlem Hospital with a gunshot wound to his midsection at around 8:15 p.m., police said. The 19-year-old man told officials he heard shots and felt pain, but was “uncooperative” with the investigation, according to the NYPD. Five minutes later, a 21-year-old man was shot in his knee in the Woodstock section of the Bronx. The shooter fled the scene outside 908 Tiffany Place, officials said. Sometime after 11 p.m., a woman was shot in the arm at 107-34 128th Street in South Richmond Hills, Queens, according to police and sources. An 8:30 p.m. fight between two D Train passengers ended when one man hit the other with a wrench, authorities said. The suspect fled and the victim was being treated for a hand laceration at Bronx Care Hospital. The violence in the boroughs came as more than 30 people were killed by guns in the US over the holiday weekend — including at least 13 in Philadelphia and six in Chicago. In addition, there has been a disturbing trend of violence on the city subways. A Goldman Sachs employee was shot down while heading to brunch on a Q Train in Manhattan earlier this month. According to police, the incident is the fourth transit homicide this year, matching the same number this time last year.
