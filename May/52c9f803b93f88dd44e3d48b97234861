Alexander Skarsgård is saying goodbye to his historic New York City co-op. The “Big Little Lies” villain listed the historic but renovated top floor apartment on Thursday for $2.6 million. Skarsgård, 45, paid $2.3 million for the one bathroom studio back in 2017 — the summer after the acclaimed show premiered. Located in the East Village, the residence was turned into a one bedroom. According to the listing, the home combines 19th century architecture with “thoughtful, modern renovation.” Features include exposed brick, wood-beamed ceilings as high as 12 feet, a wood-burning fireplace, and original pocket shutters. The kitchen has been renovated to include European white oak cabinetry, Carrara marble counter tops and a Bertazzoni range. Meanwhile, the living room is described as loft-like and comes with five skylights for optimal sunlight. The bedroom also has a skylight to gaze at the stars come bedtime. “Roof rights are included with the sale, so the next owner of this one-of-kind home has the opportunity to build a private roof deck with views of downtown and the Freedom Tower,” the listing notes. The building comes with a common garden, live-in superintendent, and basement storage lockers available for rent. Emma St. Laurent with Compass holds the listing. Currently, Skarsgård is starring in the role of Amleth, the Viking prince at the center of Robert Eggers’s “The Northman.” Rumors have recently circled that the Swedish-born actor is one of the names being considered for the role of the next James Bond.
