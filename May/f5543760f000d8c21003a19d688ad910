Johnny Manziel and girlfriend Kenzie Werner are getting an early start to the holiday weekend. In a series of Instagram Stories shared Thursday, Manziel — who plays for the Zappers in the Fan Controlled Football league — appeared alongside Werner, who sported a light-color bikini as the couple enjoyed an afternoon at TAO Beach Dayclub in Las Vegas. Werner, a Houston-based beauty specialist, is seen lounging in the pool in one video as Manziel, 29, appears to film her from inside their bungalow. The pair is also seen getting cozy in a separate post shared on Werner’s Instagram Story. Later in the day, it appears Manziel and Werner checked out a hot spot, where the former NFL quarterback was filmed embracing his gal pal. First linked in March 2021, Manziel and Werner made a splash as they got playful at the beach in Miami. TMZ reported at the time that the duo “spent time together in Scottsdale in the past.” Manziel and Werner were spotted together again following the March Miami outing, with the twosome enjoying a date night at an arcade in April. Prior to his romance with Werner, Manziel was previously married to model Bre Tiesi, who initially filed for divorce in 2019. She threw a “divorce party” last November, stating on Instagram at the time that there’s “no shade” to Manziel. “I do, I did, I’m officially done. Thanks to all my girls for the craziest divorce party. No shade to J, wish you nothing but the best, love ya,” Tiesi wrote, to which Manziel responded with a collection of crying-laughing face emojis. Tiesi is currently expecting a baby with Nick Cannon.
