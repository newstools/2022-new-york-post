A Ukrainian refugee who broke up the relationship of a British couple that took her in said her man’s jilted ex only has herself to blame. Sofiia Karkadym, 22, fled the war-torn city of Lviv and was generously taken in by security guard Tony Garnett, 29, and his then girlfriend Lorna in the UK earlier this month. But after only 10 days, sparks began to fly between Karkadym and the heavily-tattooed humanitarian and father of two. Karkadym, who was an IT professional in the Ukraine, blamed Lorna’s spiraling suspicions for pushing her into Garnett’s arms. “Her constant suspicions, the tension, it just pushed me and Tony closer together,” Karkadym told The Sun. “She created this situation by constantly suggesting something was going on when it wasn’t. So this is her fault.” Karkadym claimed her hosts’ relationship was already faltering badly by the time she rolled into town. “As far as I’m concerned they destroyed their relationship long before I arrived,” she said. “Their relationship was at fault. None of this is my work. It was my decision to leave when I did and Tony decided to come with me.” Garnett eventually evacuated from his relationship with Lorna — and is now planning a future with Karkadym. The refugee said her family has disowned her over the episode, arguing that other potential hosts will think twice before welcoming Ukrainians into their homes. “They say that because of me nobody in the UK will take in Ukrainians,” she told the Sun. “Every UK family will now think ‘I can’t take in a refugee because she will take my husband from me’. It’s more than about me, Tony and Lorna.” But despite the tensions encircling them, Garnett and Karkadym are still thriving. “I know it sounds s—t what has gone on but you deal with the cards you’ve been dealt,” Garnett said. “To me the cards I got … it was a no brainer. “I’d rather be on my arse now and happy. I know I’ve done the right thing.”
