Dom Smith is headed to Syracuse. The Mets optioned their unhappy first baseman/outfielder to the Triple-A Mets on Tuesday. The team called up pitcher Adonis Medina in a corresponding move. Smith has been vocal in recent weeks about wanting to play more. “If there’s a team out there that wants me to play and wants to let me play, I would love to play every day,” he told Newsday. “That’s just how I feel about that.” The 26-year-old later clarified to The Post that he “didn’t come out and say I want to go somewhere else.” Unfortunately for Smith, that’s where he’s headed. Smith will bring to Syracuse a paltry .186 batting average with zero homers and 14 RBIs through 39 games with the big-league squad this season.
