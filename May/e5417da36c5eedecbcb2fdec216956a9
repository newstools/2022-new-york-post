Against the odds, the Edmonton Oilers have won three games in a row to push the Calgary Flames to the edge of elimination in the Battle of Alberta on Thursday night. And while Edmonton was a +160 underdog coming into the series, there’s been nothing fluky about its performance. The Oilers have earned their 3-1 series lead by executing a savvy game plan that has taken away Calgary’s biggest strengths. Rather than put the Flames under relentless pressure, the Oilers are clearly comfortable allowing Calgary to have the lion’s share of the puck. The Flames have registered a significant advantage in shot attempts (218 to 144) at five-on-five, but only 40 of those attempts have qualified as high-danger scoring chances and 13 of those came in Calgary’s Game 1 victory.  Since then, the Oilers have limited the Flames to just 27 high-danger scoring chances, while posting 24 for themselves. It’s been a completely different series since Game 1 controlled by Edmonton. Those kinds of splits will always sit well with the Oilers, especially when they have Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Evander Kane firing on all cylinders. With that kind of star power, bet on McDavid and Company to be the difference, as the Oilers close out the series. Odds courtesy of BetMGM
