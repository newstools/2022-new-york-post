The Carolina Hurricanes are trying to keep Rangers fans from flooding their building. The Hurricanes host Games 1 and 2 of the second-round series —  as well Games 5 and 7, if necessary — starting on Wednesday at PNC Arena. They’ve resorted to limiting ticket sales to buyers in North Carolina, South Carolina, and southern Virginia. On the Ticketmaster page for Game 1, plenty of seats are available for face value of slightly under $100. There is, however, a disclaimer. “To better serve Carolina Hurricanes fans, a restricted sales area has been implemented for this Hurricanes game. PNC Arena is located in Raleigh, NC. Sales to this event will be restricted to residents of North Carolina, South Carolina and Southern Virginia,” the site message reads. “Residency will be based on credit card billing address. Orders by residents outside of the geo-limited area will be canceled without notice and refunds given. Please adhere to the published ticket limits. If you exceed the ticket limit, you may have any or all of your orders and tickets canceled without notice.” Post Sports+ members, sign up to have Mollie Walker text you the latest word on the Rangers and reply with your thoughts and questions.

This is not unheard of in sports: a few months ago, the Rams sought to keep 49ers fans out of SoFi Stadium by limiting tickets to buyers from the southern California region. Of course, Rangers fans can and will just pay a premium on the secondary market to get into the PNC Arena. The Hurricanes’ policy may slightly impede their opponents’ supporters — ticket reseller Vivid Seats projects that the crowd will still be 28 percent Rangers fans, extrapolating the data from where people have bought tickets on their marketplace — but it’s unlikely to completely eradicate the threat. The fact that the game is not sold out one day in advance will leave them vulnerable to invasion.
