Harry Styles is inviting a few lucky fans to his “House” for one night and one night only. The pop star announced on social media Monday that he will be performing new songs from his upcoming album “Harry’s House” at the UBS Arena in New York on May 20. Entry costs — get this — $25, including taxes and fees, for the exclusive concert. Pre-registration for the highly in-demand performance is open until 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 3, through Ticketmaster. The low cost spells high demand as registering for a ticket won’t necessarily guarantee a seat. Only after fans have been “verified” will they be allowed to join the actual presale (with preference given to American Express customers). They’ll find out if they’re “in” in their inbox on Wednesday. The buzz from Styles’ two-week electrifying performance at Coachella is sure to be a boon for upcoming album “Harry’s House.” The “Watermelon Sugar” singer brought out special friends Shania Twain and Lizzo and donned custom Gucci outfits. He titillated fans again last week after he told Better Homes and Gardens that he “felt ashamed” about his sex life during his One Direction days. “For a long time, it felt like the only thing that was mine was my sex life,” the “X Factor” heartthrob, now 28, told the magazine. Styles is also expected to grace the Met Gala red carpet Monday night. He co-chaired the event in 2019.
