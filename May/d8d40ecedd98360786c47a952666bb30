A man believed to be having a mental breakdown went berserk at a New Mexico gas station Wednesday — doing tens of thousands of dollars in damage as he attacked a clerk and tried to carjack an elderly customer, wild video shows. A surveillance clip released by the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office shows Elee Garcia Silva, 43, hurling several items at the worker and forcing her to flee during the rampage at Chucky’s convenience store in Las Cruces. Silva ripped a device off the store’s counter and threw it at the frightened woman as she ran for the door. He then turned his attention to the merchandise inside, grabbing whatever he could and slamming it the floor, video shows. After completely destroying the store, Silva then ran outside — where he tried to carjack an elderly man with a dog before four people ran to the would-be victim’s aide, according to the clip. Doña Ana County Sheriff Kim Stewart said Silva hit the man with a bottle and also pushed him to the ground, the Las Cruces Sun-News reported. Silva was later arrested by responding deputies. No serious injuries were reported. Silva was likely having a mental health episode at the time, Stewart told reporters Wednesday. Silva was charged with counts including felony criminal damage to property over $1,000 and felony aggravated battery, the Sun-News reported. Silva’s rage caused estimated damages of more than $20,000, the store’s manager told KTSM. One clerk who went to Chucky’s after the incident said she had to clean up for hours afterward. “She was crying and she was scared,” clerk Deidra Baeza said of her coworker on the clip. “And traumatized, I’m pretty sure.”
