It’s bye-bye Mr. “American Pie.” In light of Tuesday’s deadly mass shooting in Texas, “American Pie” singer Don McLean announced that he will no longer be performing at this year’s National Rifle Association (NRA) Convention in Houston. “In light of the recent events in Texas, I have decided it would be disrespectful and hurtful for me to perform for the NRA at their convention in Houston this week,” the 76-year-old rock star said in a statement, Fox News reported. “I’m sure all the folks planning to attend this event are shocked and sickened by these events as well. After all, we are all Americans.” McLean added, “I share the sorrow for this terrible, cruel loss with the rest of the nation.” The “Vincent” singer was one of several performers slated to take the stage at the Friday convention; others included Lee Greenwood, Larry Gatlin, and Danielle Peck, TMZ reported. So far, the rest of the musicians are still scheduled to perform at the three-day firearm fest, which will reportedly “showcase over 14 acres of the latest guns and gear,” per the event’s website. The event will also feature appearances by former president Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Friday’s annual convention is a mere four-hour drive from Uvalde, where Tuesday’s deadly shooting took place. The convention comes four days after Tuesday’s massacre, in which an 18-year-old gunman — who has since been identified as Uvalde resident Salvador Ramos — opened fire at Robb Elementary School, killing 19 students and four teachers, before he was shot dead by police. In light of the tragedy, gun control advocates are calling on Texas officials to move the NRA convention out of state.
