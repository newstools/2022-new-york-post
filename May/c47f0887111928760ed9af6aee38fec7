Mayor Eric Adams met with the 77 NYPD precinct commanders and other top brass Saturday to discuss ways to stem the city’s rising tide of crime ahead of the summer. Adams emphasized the need for police to be more involved with the public and local communities, saying commanders should know the school principals, and those in charge of homeless services or other agencies in their areas, according to sources at the meeting. “I need everybody to buy in,” he told those assembled at One Police Plaza. Adams also expressed support for Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell, who was at the meeting, saying, “As long as I’m the mayor, she’s going to be my police commissioner,” according to an attendee. He went around the room and asked the commanders for their input. One of those who attended characterized the two-hour summit as “very positive.” Another meeting was slated for the heads of transit precincts.
