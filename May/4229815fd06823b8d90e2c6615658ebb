Well, this is awkward. Sky News broadcaster Martin Brundle had quite the mix-up Sunday during Formula 1’s Grand Prix in Miami, where he stopped Duke’s Paolo Banchero on the track, believing the NBA prospect was Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In the video, which has unsurprisingly gone viral, Brundle exclaimed, “Patrick,” as he walked behind Banchero, who is expected to be a top pick in this year’s NBA Draft. Upon catching up to the 19-year-old Blue Devils star, Brundle asked “Mahomes” about his experience at the race before realizing his error. “It’s not Patrick, and that’s why you ignored me in the beginning. What’s your name, sir?” Brundle, 62, asked, to which the 6-foot-10 Banchero introduced himself. Once properly acquainted with Banchero, Brundle said, “Well, I thought I was talking to somebody else. I’m sorry about that,” before he exited stage left and muttered “whatever” into the mic. Brundle’s blunder with Banchero isn’t the first eye-catching exchange the British commentator has had on the track. Back in October, Brundle — who is a former racer — attempted to stop Megan Thee Stallion for an impromptu interview at the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, but was swiftly shut down by her security team. Mahomes, meanwhile, was in Miami over the weekend, where he took in the race with wife Brittany Matthews, whom he married in a lavish ceremony in Hawaii in March. The 26-year-old quarterback mingled with David Beckham and Serena Williams, among others, during the star-studded event.
