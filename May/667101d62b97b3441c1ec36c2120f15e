A Florida woman is facing felony animal cruelty raps after she left four dogs in her sweltering car while eating lunch — resulting in their deaths, police said. Tesia White, 25, said she turned on her car’s air conditioning and left the pooches inside while she had a meal Thursday in New Smyrna Beach, according to cops. White claimed checked on the dogs at one point during the meal and they did not seem distressed, police said. But she came back to the car an hour later and found the animals dead. Cops said the air conditioning was not on when she returned and that the heat index had hit 89 degrees at the time. White and her boyfriend where both distraught and crying at the scene, according to Click Orlando. “I should not be allowed to own a dog,” White said at the scene, according to a police report, the outlet reported. “I cannot believe I let this happened.” Police said a 4-year-old goldendoodle, a 2-year-old boxer and a pair of 12-week-old goldendoodle puppies all perished. White was arrested and faces four counts of animal cruelty and booked into Volusia County Branch Jail on $10,000 bond.
