More lawmakers may be called to testify by the Jan. 6 committee as early as next week, according to a new report. House select committee chiefs of staff and aides got word Friday on their weekly call with committee staff that more legislators will be asked to testify, Axios reported Saturday. The briefers did not say which lawmakers will be contacted, or whether they intended to issue more subpoenas, the sources told Axios. The committee on Thursday issued subpoenas to five House Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the Judiciary Committee’s ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The televised hearings begin June 9.
