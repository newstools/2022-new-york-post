Consumer Reports has signed a two-year lease for a 8,189 square-foot office at the Durst Organization’s 675 Third Ave. The teeny-tiny lease is notable because it will be the first time the venerable product- and service-testing organ has ever had a Manhattan office. The satellite location in the recently upgraded tower will give Consumer Reports staff easy access to their Yonkers headquarters via Metro North from nearby Grand Central Terminal.
