PHILADELPHIA — Two straight days of rainouts might have left the Mets waterlogged at the plate for Game 1 of Sunday’s doubleheader against the Phillies. In their first action since Thursday’s dramatic win in which they overcame a six-run deficit in the ninth, late-inning magic never arrived in a 3-2 loss at Citizens Bank Park. The Mets (19-10) went 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position, most notably missing an opportunity in the seventh after receiving walks from Pete Alonso and Eduardo Escobar to begin the inning against Jose Alvarado. The lefty Alvarado struck out the next three batters: Dominic Smith, Starling Marte and Luis Guillorme. Max Scherzer succumbed to weak contact in allowing three earned runs on 10 hits over six innings. Nine of the hits against Scherzer were singles, and seven of them had an exit velocity of 77 mph or less. The loss was Scherzer’s first in his last 25 starts. Jake Arrieta (2015-16) was the last MLB pitcher to go 24 straight starts without a loss. Bryce Harper hammered a 94-mph fastball that was left over the plate for a homer in the first inning that gave the Phillies their first run. Harper also homered against Scherzer last Sunday night at Citi Field. Three straight singles against Scherzer — the last of which was delivered by Harper — extended the Phillies’ lead to 2-0 in the third. In the fourth, Bryson Stott’s RBI single widened the Mets’ deficit to 3-0. The single was the Phillies’ fourth of the inning. In his previous start, Scherzer allowed four earned runs over six innings against the Phillies. Marte’s leadoff double in the sixth led to the Mets scoring their first run of the game against Kyle Gibson, on James McCann’s double-play grounder. Francisco Lindor stroked an RBI double that pulled the Mets within 3-2 after Brandon Nimmo’s two-out single. Gibson limited the Mets to two earned runs on six hits over six innings with three strikeouts.
