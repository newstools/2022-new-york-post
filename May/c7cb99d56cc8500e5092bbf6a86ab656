A Florida woman was arrested after crashing into several cars and throwing a fake snake at pursuing police officers to avoid arrest, authorities said. The five-mile chase began at around 10:15 a.m. Wednesday when the unidentified woman sped off at high speeds as authorities were trying to pull over a different vehicle in Martin County, news station WTAP reported. A deputy then pursued the woman’s pickup truck, which slammed on its brakes, forcing pursing officers to swerve, authorities said. The woman took off again and attempted to hit three police cruisers, before crashing into a civilian vehicle and causing it to flip and injure three other people, authorities said. “She came out of the vehicle and instead of surrendering, she threw what looked like a real snake at our deputy,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said. Snyder said the object, later determined to be a rubber snake, was thrown just moments after the deputy had holstered his gun. “Fortunately for her, instead of re-engaging with the firearm, he goes for a Taser and ends it right there,” remarks Snyder. “If she had thrown that snake, when the gun was out, we may be talking about police officer-involved shooting right now.” Police have charged the woman with aggravated assault and aggravated battery of a law enforcement officer.
