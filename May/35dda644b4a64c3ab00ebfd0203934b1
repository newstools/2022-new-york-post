The #MayThe4thBeWithYou moment has arrived — full force. Just after midnight, Disney’s official “Obi-Wan-Kenobi” account teased that it would be dropping a “new trailer today” for the highly anticipated Disney+ series on May 4th, or “Star Wars Day” for fans. The studio did not disappoint fans of the galaxy-spanning saga when the full trailer debuted Wednesday morning: Obi-Wan’s failed apprentice Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader makes an appearance. The crowd-pleasing trailer for the streaming series also depicts Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) on the run from the growing Empire, as well as a new force of Jedi-hunting enemies called the Inquisitors (played by Star Wars new-comers Moses Ingram and Rupert Friend) as well verbal altercations with Joel Edgerton — who reprises his role as Owen Lars. Throughout the footage, there are several action-packed sequences as well the appearance of the iconic lightsaber. The presence of the series’ main antagonist — Darth Vader — is felt throughout the entire trailer with several references to the iconic villain sprinkled in. Fans will also get to see a brief glimpse of the Dark Lord as his limbs are reattached and hear his breathing at the end of the trailer. In addition, Disney also released a brand new poster for the show showing McGregor as Obi-wan with Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader in the background. “Kenobi” is set to air on Disney+ starting May 27.
