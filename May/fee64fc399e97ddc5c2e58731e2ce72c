Apple is pushing back its plan to require workers to spend three days per week in the office due to a surge in coronavirus cases, according to a report. The iPhone maker is still making employees come in two days per week and will now require them to wear masks in common areas, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg. The three-day-per-week requirement had been slated to take effect on Monday. Apple did not give a new date, according to the outlet. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Post previously reported that Apple workers were threatening to quit over CEO Tim Cook’s return-to-office policy, which is more strict than other Big Tech companies. “I don’t give a single f—k about ever coming back to work here,” one Apple employee ranted on corporate message board Blind in March ahead of the company’s return-to-office deadline, saying they planned to resign the day they come back to the office. “I already know I won’t be able to deal with the commute and sitting around for 8 hours,” the employee said. Another Apple employee responded with a laughing emoji and wrote: “I’m gonna do the same.” “Hell YEAH my man let’s do this!” a third employee chimed in. “F–k RTO.” Other Big Tech firms including Meta and Google are letting some employees work remotely forever.
