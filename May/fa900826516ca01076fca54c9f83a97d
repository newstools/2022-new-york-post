She’s known for her dirty mouth — and this certainly doesn’t help. Sarah Silverman has admitted she’s been sharing a toothbrush with her boyfriend Rory Albanese since they started dating back in late 2020. The comedian, 51, confessed to the unsavory dental practice during an interview on “The View” Wednesday, declaring: “We’ve never not shared a toothbrush.” The daytime hosts were left startled by the confession, with co-star Sunny Hostin, 53, saying she was “befuddled” by the behavior. Silverman stressed that she had always had her own toothbrush during previous relationships, but didn’t see what the big deal was about sharing one with Albanese. “Why is that so gross? We kiss each other where we pee!” Silverman quipped, prompting shock from the audience. “The View” co-star Joy Behar, 79, shot back: “Not everyone does that!” Moderator Whoopi Goldberg, 66, was forced to take the reins of the conversation before Silverman could utter any other NSFW remarks. “Look, do what you wanna do in your house!” Goldberg explained, before quickly cutting to a commercial break. “My body, my choice!” Silverman joked as the show’s theme music started to play. Silverman went public with her relationship with Albanese — a fellow comedian — back in October 2020. Speaking with Ellen DeGeneres at the time, the star said they connected during the COVID-19 lockdown while playing video games online. “As the world was shutting down, I thought I should start playing video games again,” Silverman stated. “I was in New York, so at 7 we would bang the pots and pans out on the fire escape. … Then at 7:05, I’d put my headset on and I’d kill Nazis with this guy. Yadda yadda yadda, we’re boyfriend and girlfriend!” Silverman subsequently told Howard Stern: “I’d like to just be together all the time forever. If Rory was someone who was like, ‘I need to be married,’ then yeah, I’d think about it, I guess.”
