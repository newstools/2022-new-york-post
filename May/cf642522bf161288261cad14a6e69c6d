Police in Wichita, Kansas are on the hunt for a suspect they dubbed the “poopetrator” who defecated in the middle of a beauty store last week. Authorities did not release the woman’s name, but said Tuesday they have confirmed the identity of the “public enemy number 2” who was caught on surveillance camera going to the bathroom in an aisle of the Mid-K Beauty Supply store on East 21st Street on May 10. According to police, the “defecation was significant enough that 8 wigs were destroyed as a result.” The incident was caught on camera but “for the good of all of you we are not posting the footage of the offending fecal assault,” Wichita cops said. “We’ve already confirmed that this is NOT Amber Heard so please stop calling and emailing that info,” the department quipped in the comments.
