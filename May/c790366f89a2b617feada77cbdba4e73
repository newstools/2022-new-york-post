This kid is a cheeseburgler. Texas mom Kelsey Burkhalter Golden was in for a very cheesy surprise when her toddler sneakily took her phone and ordered 31 cheeseburgers from McDonald’s. Barrett, 2, cheekily grabbed his mom’s cell to play some digital games but wound up buying an excess of fast-food burgers via DoorDash. The mom, from Kingsville, took to Facebook on Sunday to share that she has “31 free cheeseburgers from McDonald’s if anyone is interested.” “Apparently my 2 yr old knows how to order DoorDash,” she jokingly scribed. Alongside the post, the mom shared a cute snap of Barrett sitting on a table and munching on a cheeseburger next to a mountain of yellow paper-wrapped McDonald’s goodies next to him. The total bill for the extra lunchtime sandwiches was $91.70 and included a $16 tip for the DoorDash driver who had to make the trek to her house. Golden further elaborated on the funny moment with local news station KRIS, explaining that she had been using her computer when her son took her mobile device. She didn’t think anything of it and believed he would just be fiddling around with the camera. “He usually likes to take pictures of himself, and so he was doing that. I thought I’d locked the phone but apparently, I didn’t, because then DoorDash came with 31 cheeseburgers,” she told the outlet. “I didn’t know what to do with them, he only ate half of one, so I posted on a community page on Facebook here in Kingsville and asked if anybody wanted some,” she added. In an interview with KHOU 11, Golden noted that she’s hoping to keep her son from making large and unintended orders from food delivery services in the future. “I guess I need to hide the app or something because DoorDash is not protected,” she revealed. Golden also said she was hoping nearby friends would come to pick up a free cheeseburger. “There’s somebody coming in 10 minutes to pick some up, but I don’t know how many she wants,” she said.
