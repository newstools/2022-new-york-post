Elon Musk’s net worth has fallen below $200 billion as the share price of his electric car company, Tesla, continues its slide and his stake in Twitter goes underwater. Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, has a fortune that as of Wednesday was valued at $193 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Since the start of the year, however, he has seen his wealth shrink by $77.6 billion as Wall Street appears on the verge of a bear market. Musk and other multibillionaires have seen their fortunes shrink. The 50 wealthiest people, including Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, lost an aggregate of half a trillion dollars in wealth since the start of 2022. Shares of Tesla fell nearly 7% on Tuesday as the company’s assembly line has been hampered by ongoing coronavirus lockdowns in China. On April 4, Tesla was trading at $1,145 a share. That was the day Musk announced that he purchased a 9.2% stake in the social media company Twitter. Since then, however, the stock price of both companies have tanked. Tesla on Tuesday sank to its lowest price of $620.57 a share before closing at $628.16. Twitter hardly fared better on Tuesday. Its stock price fell 6% on Tuesday, closing at $35.76 — its lowest since March 16. Since the start of the year, Twitter stock has fallen 17.6% while Tesla shares have dropped by 40.8%. Both companies’ losses have surpassed that of the S&P 500, which has shed 17.5% year to date. Twitter shares have fallen 31.1% since closing at a high of $51.70 on April 25 — when the company’s board of directors accepted Musk’s $44 billion buyout offer. Musk bought his 9.2% stake in Twitter, or 73.12 million shares, at a weighted average price of $36.16, according to MarketWatch. At the current stock price, Musk would end up losing $40.7 million on his investment. That’s a stark swing from the $1.14 billion gain from the April 25 closing price of $51.70. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has raised his public profile, though it has come with a price. Last week, it was revealed that Musk’s space travel firm, SpaceX, paid $250,000 in hush money to settle sex misconduct claims brought by a flight attendant in 2016.
