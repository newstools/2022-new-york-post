We should all celebrate our bodies exactly as they are – and one woman has been praised for proudly showing off her belly button. TikTok user Chi, who posts under @iam_amakae, regularly shares dance videos wearing crop tops that reveal her protruding navel. Far from trying to hide it, Chi has been happily displaying it on TikTok and Instagram. In one clip, she wrote: “Body perfect. Love yourself.” In another, Chi added: “Self confidence, the real me.” She has racked up over 3 million likes on TikTok and people have been quick to praise her videos. One said: “Ur beautiful in every way and that navel is the finishing touch of ur beauty.” Another added: “Yes it is perfect.” Although Chi hasn’t shared much information about her belly button, people have been quick to theorize in the comments. One said: “the doctor probably didn’t cut her umbilical cord properly when she was first born so it grew like that, the same happened to my cousin.” A second commented: “Look like umbilical hernia that hasn’t been repaired.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
