It was the early afternoon, but “Saturday Night Fever” filled the air. Passersby outside Lincoln Center Saturday couldn’t help but be mesmerized by a 1,300-pound disco ball that will be front and center when its famous plaza is temporarily transformed into what is being dubbed the city’s “largest outdoor dance floor.” The disco ball, which measures 10 feet in diameter, will be showcased from June 1 to Aug. 14 at “The Oasis on Josie Robertson Plaza.” “I’ll absolutely be back here when it’s all set up,” said Nick DeLio, 56.  “I wouldn’t call myself a dancer, but I want to be a part of it. It’s gonna be awesome when they hit it with the lights — probably illuminate the whole place.” Grethe Winther, 78, of Washington, DC, was on her way to the Metropolitan Opera House when she just had to pause to photograph the giant disco ball. “It’s good they’re putting something up so many people can enjoy,” she said.
