Nina Jankowicz just quit and the Disinformation Governance Board is dead. It’s the best possible ending to a move that was demented from the start. Whatever the Department of Homeland Security thought the DGB would do, the board’s ham-handed launch (and very name) could only feed the direst suspicions. The US government has no business determining what’s “disinformation” — certainly not via an Orwellian shadow department, housed within a national security agency. Of course it sparked outcries from free-speech supporters. And Jankowicz was singularly ill-suited to the job: She pushed the Russiagate lies (taken in by the most successful disinformation effort of our lives) and joined in the suppression of The Post’s Hunter Biden reporting. And she’s supposed to be an expert? Tapping her to head the DGB, in short, told everyone that the board would be all about imposing left-wing narratives at the expense of truth. Sadly, most left-liberals have their heads so far up their butts that they don’t see the obvious. Bizarro-world queen Taylor Lorenz of The Washington Post even insists Jankowicz was hounded out by more “disinformation,” which in liberal usage clearly now means simply “facts the left doesn’t like.”
