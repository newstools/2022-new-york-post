The grandmother of the crazed gunman who killed 21 at a Texas elementary school last week worked at the school as a teacher’s aide, a close friend of the family told The Post. The friend, who asked to be kept anonymous, did not know if that’s why Salvador Ramos, 18, chose Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, as his target — but his grandmother’s employment there is the first direct link between Ramos and the school, which is a half-mile from her home. “His grandmother worked in one of those classrooms a lot of the time,” the friend told The Post. “She knows a lot of the kids who died and was close to them.” Before Ramos went on a rampage at the school, he shot his grandmother, Celia “Sally” Martinez Gonzales, in the face at her home. While Gonzales was employed by the school at the time of the shooting, according to the friend and public records, it’s not clear why she was not there on the day of the attack. The teenager had been sleeping on his grandparents’ couch two or three months before the shooting, Ramos’ grandfather previously told The Post. The husband said his 66-year-old wife had asked Ramos to start paying for his own cellphone bill just before the shooting happened. She is being treated in a San Antonio hospital after her cheek was nearly blown off. “She has a notebook where she writes what she’s trying to say, but when we can’t make it out, she gets frustrated,” Rolando Reyes told The Post. Public records list “Sally,” as she was known to her friends and acquaintances, as a teacher’s aide at Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. A spokeswoman for the school district could not be immediately reached for comment. “I’m not sure if that’s what his motive was,” said the family friend. “I’ve heard so many things about why he was there. It will all come out in the end.”
