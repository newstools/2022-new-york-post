The NYPD will beef up patrols at Catholic churches citywide this weekend amid planned protests over the leaked Supreme Court draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, according to an internal police memo. Officers are instructed to do at least two drive-by patrols per tour between midnight Friday and midnight Sunday to potentially combat violent pro-choice protests or other chaotic incidents. “Due to recent events surrounding the US Supreme Court document leak pertaining to Roe v. Wade, cops must have a heightened awareness while on patrol,” states the NYPD memo sent out Thursday. “Special attention must be paid in the vicinity of the Catholic church especially during Sunday morning Mass.” Joseph Zwilling, director of communications at the Archdiocese of New York, told The Post on Friday that the archdiocese plans to increase security too because of the planned demonstrations. “We are aware of the call for some kind of protest, and without going into specifics, will work with law enforcement and take appropriate steps as needed,” he said. Pro-choice activists this week called on Americans to storm Catholic churches on Mother’s Day to protest the potential end of nationwide abortion rights. The pro-choice group Ruth Sent Us, named after late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, urged followers on Twitter to “rise up against a corrupt and illegitimate” SCOTUS after Monday’s bombshell leak of the draft opinion. “Whether you’re a ‘Catholic for Choice,’ ex-Catholic, of other or no faith, recognize that six extremist Catholics set out to overturn Roe,” the group tweeted Tuesday. “Stand at or in a local Catholic Church Sun May 8. #WarOnWomen #MothersDayStrike.”
