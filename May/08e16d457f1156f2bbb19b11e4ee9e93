It appears as though the Yankees have lost a key depth starter. Pitching prospect Luis Gil, who left his start on Wednesday for Triple-A Scranton with a right elbow injury, will need Tommy John surgery, according to Hector Gomez of the Dominican Republic’s Z101Digital. A few hours before Gomez’s report, Yankees manager Aaron Boone called the injury “significant,” but declined to elaborate on what had happened to Gil. He said the Yankees were still working through different doctors’ opinions to figure out the next course of action. Gil made one spot start for the Yankees this year after pitching well for them as a depth starter last season, when he went 1-1 with a 3.07 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 29 ¹/₃ innings.
