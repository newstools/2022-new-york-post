Rep. Tom Suozzi vowed Wednesday to release his tax returns before the June 28 primary for governor — hours after being pressed by The Post on the disclosure. “Congressman Suozzi has filed an extension as he does each year, but he will make his tax returns available within the next two weeks,” Kim Devlin, a senior advisor to the Long Island Democrat’s campaign, said in a statement. The gubernatorial hopeful had declined to make such a commitment just hours before, despite recent promises to release his taxes at an unspecified time. “I’m not gonna commit to that, but listen, I’ll give you any financial information you want,” Suozzi said Wednesday while claiming that his taxes were too complicated to be released before the primary vote against Hochul and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. The excuse echoed past refusals by New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who later walked back such comments, and former President Donald Trump to release their own tax returns. Suozzi, a former Nassau County executive, has attacked rival Gov. Kathy Hochul — who has released her own tax returns — for alleged ethical problems while proposed reforms of his own while calling for more accountability for elected officials, especially in scandal-plagued Albany His campaign has suggested that he has nothing to hide and that details of his personal finances have already been disclosed for the past five years he has served in Congress. The House Ethics Committee is also probing Suozzi’s alleged failures to report stock transactions per House rules. Suozzi has nothing to hide about his finances, according to his campaign. “All of the Congressman’s financials are available for the past five years in his annual disclosures to Congress,” Devlin said in the statement.
