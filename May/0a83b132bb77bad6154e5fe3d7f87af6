Cops know what’s in this thief’s wallet. A Queens bandit walked into a Capital One bank in Sunnyside and walked out with $2,500, police said. The suspect, described as a light-skinned male, clad in black sweater and black hat, entered 40-20 Queens Blvd. shortly before 9:40 a.m. Saturday, passed a note to a teller and demanded money, the NYPD said. The teller handed over the dough, police said. Read the chilling note: “THIS IS A BANK ROBBERY. I HAVE A GUN. NO ALARM – OR I WILL SHOOT. NO DYE PACK — OR I WILL SHOOT. Give ME 100 dollar BILLS and 50 doLLAR BiLLS. I  HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.” The bandit, who did not display a weapon, then fled the bank without further incident, cops said. No one was injured.
