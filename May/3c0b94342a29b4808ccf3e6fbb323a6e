The “Monaco-inspired” marina and yacht club created by Miami Dolphins and Hard Rock Stadium co-owner Stephen Ross may be fake, but the buzz for Miami’s first Grand Prix this weekend is very real. Four tickets in the “fake” yacht club, with dry docked yachts, are selling for $38,000, according to reports. And Brazilian race-car driving legend Emerson Fittipaldi, an ambassador at Miami Grand Prix, is also doing a speed tour of some of Miami’s priciest penthouses. On Tuesday night, Fittipaldi, 75 — a two-time Formula 1 world champ and Indy 500 winner — toured a $30 million penthouse duplex at Chateau Beach in Sunny Isles. The sprawling four-bedroom home, at 17475 Collins Ave., is by the beach and comes with ocean views, naturally. At 9,051 square feet, it features a striking 4,525-square-foot wraparound terrace with a private pool. Designer Graciela Dayan decked out the sleek, high-ceilinged interior space with furnishings by Fendi, Poltrona Frau and Minotti. The listing broker is Cristiano Piquet, founder of Piquet Realty.
