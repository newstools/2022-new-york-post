In a glorious sign of a return to normalcy, the men and women of the US Navy, Marines and Coast Guard are again gracing the city’s streets: After two years, Fleet Week is back. The Parade of Ships arrived Wednesday to kick off the week’s festivities, one of New York’s dearly held traditions, with the USS Bataan (otherwise known as the Big 5, one of the largest ships in the military) leading the way. “Being able to pull up here and fly and see where I grew up, it’s awesome,” Bryce Batiancela, USN and a born and raised Staten Islander, told ABC7. More than 3,000 sailors will take part in Fleet Week, and nearly 100,000 visitors are expected to come out for events from Staten Island to Times Square to East Meadow, plus ship tours from Thursday through Memorial Day. It’s a beautiful chance to thank our men and women in uniform for their life of service. And, who knows, perhaps get a kiss from a sailor.
