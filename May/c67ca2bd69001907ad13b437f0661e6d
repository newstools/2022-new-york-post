WWE legend “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan revealed in an Instagram video Sunday that his cancer has returned. Duggan, who had his prostate removed last October, began treatment this week. The WWE Hall of Famer said he is preparing to begin radiation treatment five days a week over the course of eight weeks. Duggan, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011, said, “The doctors are very optimistic that they caught it early, but still, it’s a very terrifying time for me and my family.” The 68-year-old Duggan has been documenting his recent travels around the country with his wife Debra, and said the couple will continue to do so. “The doctors also said to go ahead and live life, which we’re gonna do,” Duggan said in the clip, with his wife sitting beside him. “So, I’m afraid I’m gonna make most shows, but some shows, I’m gonna have to postpone or cancel. And I’m sorry about that, but that’s the way it’s got to be.” Duggan went on to thank this fans and supporters, urging them not to feel sorry him. “You folks have helped me through an awful, awful lot over the years, many times before, and sharing this with you is gonna help me get through this,” he said. “So thank you. And please don’t feel sorry for me. Be thankful that they caught it early. Thoughts and prayers are more than welcome. And remember, I’ll get through this. Thanks very much folks.” Duggan said he will continue to document his health journey in hopes that it will help others in similar situations. Duggan made his WWE debut in 1987 — when it was known as the WWF — and won the first ever Royal Rumble a year later. He remained with WWF until 1993, when he transitioned to rival World Championship Wrestling (WCW).
