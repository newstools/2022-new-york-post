The Nets didn’t come up small just figuratively, but literally as well. Brooklyn’s lack of size and length cost them in the playoffs last season against Milwaukee and got underscored this year against Boston. It’s a problem they need to fix if they hope to contend next season. “We were exceptionally small against a big team (the Celtics), so it gets exposed,” said Steve Nash. “We’re playing five guys who were 6-[foot]-3 and under against a team that really doesn’t play anyone that size at all, so that can give you limitations defensively. “How do you really evaluate where you want to go defensively, because it looks so different [when] you play [against] a bigger group on the floor than when you play two or three 6-2, 6-3 guys out there. Some of those things, on one hand, you expect not to face again; on the other hand, it’s an opportunity to look at what if we’re in that position again?”
