Jets quarterback Zach Wilson has a decision to make. The former first-round pick was invited to participate in the second year of George Kittle’s Tight End University next month, but apparently, he will be in Cabo at the time. “You can help me peer pressure him,” Kittle told Mike Florio on “#PFTPM” Sunday. “But Zach Wilson is at about 99 percent. He’s trying to decide if he wants to come back from Cabo or not. I was like, ‘Zach, you’re going to come back from Cabo,’ so if you want to help me influence him a little bit.” On Sunday night, Wilson re-posted Kittle’s quote to his Instagram story, writing, “Yeah so I guess I’m going to TEU.” Kittle then shared the message to his Instagram story, confirming, “[Wilson’s] in.” Kittle also said on “#PFTPM” that he’s trying to convince Bills quarterback Josh Allen to join TEU’s 2022 event. Current 49ers quarterback Trey Lance will be in attendance, as well as quarterbacks Nick Mullens (Raiders) and C.J. Beathard (Jaguars). “Then, the last one I’m working on, Josh Allen’s trying to see if he can make it work,” said Kittle. “Hopefully, we have a handful of awesome quarterbacks there who could also talk to us about running routes and what they see out there.” Tight End University will take place at Vanderbilt University in Nashville from June 22-24. Kittle, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and former NFL tight end Greg Olsen established the event in 2021, to bring the entire tight end community together to bond, collaborate with, and learn amongst their peers. Attendees will participate in a variety of activities including film study, on-field drills, recovery, rehabilitation and more. In addition to current NFL tight ends, TEU also invited several retired legends as coaches.
