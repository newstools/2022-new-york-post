ESPN’s new “Monday Night Football” broadcast team in Joe Buck and Troy Aikman dropped a surprise announcement on Monday’s episode of “Good Morning America.” The former Fox broadcasters, who left the network for ESPN this offseason, announced the special Week 2 showcase event with a pair of primetime Monday matchups. ESPN and ABC will air two NFL games on Sept. 19 — beginning with the Titans-Bills game at 7:15 p.m. ET on ESPN, and the Vikings-Eagles matchup starting at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC. It is unclear which of the games Buck and Aikman will call that evening. In recent years, ESPN had a Week 1 doubleheader with the second game starting after the first. Last season, the network moved back to a single game in the opening week of the season. The Week 2 doubleheader differs in that both games will be on at the same time for a majority of the games. The full 2022 NFL schedule will be released on Thursday with more announcements anticipated throughout the week. Aikman and Buck, who’ve called over 300 games together for Fox, will step into the “Monday Night Football” booth on Sept. 12. It was announced in March that Aikman was leaving Fox to sign a new broadcast deal with ESPN. Buck followed shortly thereafter when Fox let him out of his contract a year early. The pair has been broadcast partners since 2002 and have called six Super Bowls together. Last week, the NFL announced five international games during the 2022 season — with the first-ever NFL regular-season game set to take place in Germany, on Nov. 13, when the Seahawks face the Buccaneers at 9:30 a.m. ET at Allianz Arena, home of FC Bayern Munich. The game will air on NFL Network.
