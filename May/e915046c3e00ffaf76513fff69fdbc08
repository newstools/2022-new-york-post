Viewer discretion is advised on this one. During the second round of the UFC 274 fight between Tony Ferguson and Michael Chandler, Ferguson was knocked out by an unbelievable front-kick to the face. UFC president Dana White was shocked to see “El Cucuy” get hit like that. White at his post-fight press conference said he had no medical update yet on Ferguson, “other than, that was the most vicious knockout that I have ever seen.” Ferguson was able to walk out of the octagon under his own power but everyone was understandably worried about Ferguson’s health. Former UFC heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell is no stranger to brutal knockout losses late in his career. Liddell, sitting cageside, was seen consoling Ferguson as he walked out of the cage on Saturday. It was a disappointing result for Ferguson as he has lost four straight bouts, and questions about his UFC career have been swirling about whether he would stay with the company. Ferguson is obviously displeased with UFC brass, saying that they operate as “drug dealers sometimes,” don’t offer health insurance to fighters and prohibited Ferguson from competing in other sports like boxing, WWE and even baseball. With all of these things considered, it would appear very possible that the UFC grants Ferguson his release before long.
