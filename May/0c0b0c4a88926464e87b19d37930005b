Two NYPD officers were shot at while they were standing outside of a building in the Rockaways on Saturday, video shows. Shots were fired at the officers outside of the New Horizon Counseling Center at Beach 66 Street and Beach Channel Drive in Arverne around 5:15 p.m., cops said. Neither officer was struck. One of the officers returned fire but did not hit anybody, cops said. The officers are not believed to be the intended targets, according to law enforcement sources. Video of the shooting obtained by The Post shows two officers standing against a wall when suddenly they jump into action as they realize they are under fire. The shots appeared to have come from two individuals seen across the street, who sprint away from the scene, video shows. One officer runs for cover out of frame while the second officer draws his weapon and takes cover behind an ATV. He points his weapon in the direction of the suspected shooters and appears to fire back. The suspects were described as a man in a gray hoodie and gray sweatpants and a man in a black hoodie, police sources said. Both are believed to be between the ages of 18 and 20. At least one person has been taken into custody in connection with the shooting, sources said. One witness, Andrea, was attending a Memorial Day weekend party when she heard at least six shots ring out. “We heard a couple gunshots come from that direction and people were running away,” she said, pointing toward 67th Street. “There was a bunch of guys running away from the store.” She said she saw people scatter after hearing the shots. “It is what it is. It happens all the time in this neighborhood,” she said. “It’s unfortunate but it’s a regular occurrence.” “This area right here, they do all the shooting,” said another resident of the neighborhood. “They need to have cops over here.” “They take the cops out of here and they start shooting,” she added.
