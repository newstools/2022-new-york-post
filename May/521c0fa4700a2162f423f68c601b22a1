Game 2 of the Boston Celtics vs. Miami Heat series tips off Thursday night at 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN, and Matt Moore of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). The Heat arrive with a 1-0 advantage in the Eastern Conference Finals, but Moore isn’t interested in backing a side. Instead, he’s choosing to hone in on the under 206.5 as his best bet. Essentially, Moore’s confidence stems from the fact he believes the Celtics won’t replicate their offensive performance from Game 1. “In the first half, the Celtics put up 15 transition points on its way to its third-highest point total of the playoffs,” Moore says. “The only games where they had more came against the Brooklyn Nets and their woeful defense.” The second half of Game 1 proved a different story, though, as Miami’s defense shut down the Celtics offense while putting up a 22-2 run. Moore does caution bettors to wait until news surrounding Marcus Smart becomes available before betting the under. If Smart isn’t available, the Heat will “still be able to target [half-court] possessions, but they’ll have more counters.” Ultimately for Moore, he believes both sides’ path to victories lies in a strong defensive performance, another reason to back the under. “If the Celtics win, it’s going to be because they shut down Miami’s half-court offense and keep Jimmy Butler in check,” Moore says. “If the Heat win, it’s likely because they held Boston to bad half-court marks like in Game 1 and limit those transition opportunities.”  But either outcome leads Moore to the under, so he recommends bettors back a defensive showcase tonight in South Beach.
