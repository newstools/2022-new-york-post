Mayor Adams and the technicolor dreamcoat he wore to the Met Gala have had little impact on everyday crime here in NYC. But this one’s not on him. A malfunctioning subway camera was the reason police could not quickly locate the man who fired on straphangers last month. A list of working subway cameras, all six, will be posted soon. Stay safe. Thank you for riding the MTA. The Tigers are in Houston this weekend. Detroit’s Beau Brieske (0-1, 3.60) will start Friday. The Rockies welcomed the rookie, scoring three runs over five frames in his shaky debut. Beau pitched a beauty next out, limiting the potent Dodgers to one run over five. Luis Garcia (1-1, 4.15) throws for the home team. Luis was touched for seven runs over his last 12 innings, both games against the Jays. The Bluebirds hit. Detroit, not so much. Play 10 units on the Astros.  Eight is enough. Our winning streak is over. Orioles 5, Twins 3. Austin Hays and Ryan Mountcastle hit back-to-back homers. Account at +321 cesartovars.
