A Texas sheriff’s deputy was airlifted to a hospital after he was struck by a drunk driver during this year’s annual “go topless” Jeep weekend that devolved into chaos. Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset told FOX 26 Houston that one of his deputies, Sgt. John Hamm, was hit by an alleged drunk driver early Sunday morning as he was responding to a crash. The deputy nearly went through the car’s windshield he was hit so hard, Trochesset said. Dozens of others were sent to the hospital and more than 100 were arrested during the weekend-long event for Jeep drivers at the Bolivar Peninsula. More than 80,000 people attended the event at the beach destination in Galveston County. Hamm was airlifted to the University of Texas Medical Branch, KTRK-TV reported. He suffered two broken legs, and also an arm and head injury and underwent surgery Sunday. The driver accused of hitting him was Darius Danzell Gilbert, 22, of Jefferson County who was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer. He was being held on a $100,000 bond. Deputies responded all weekend to assaults, fights and drunk driving, Trochesset told FOX 26. At least 39 people were sent to hospitals during Jeep weekend, including eight that were flown by helicopter, KPRC reported. Galveston County Emergency Services District No.2 said on Facebook the weekend festivities were straining emergency services despite months long planning with state and local representatives. “There has been a significant increase in the size of the crowds this year, additional resources to support those already in place have been requested to ensure that emergency services are available for the protection of both the first responders and residents of the Bolivar Peninsula,” the district wrote.
