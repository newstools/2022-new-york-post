A KFC employee in Memphis helped save a kidnapped woman who left a note at the fast-food joint begging for help, authorities said. The unidentified employee called police to the restaurant around 5 p.m. to report that there had been a man at the restaurant holding a woman against her will, FOX13 reported. The staffer gave authorities a rough description of both the man and woman as well a note the woman had written begging for help, an affidavit said. Police tracked down Diego Glay, who fit the employee’s description. Glay fled police after failing to comply with instructions, but officers managed to subdue and arrest him after a short foot chase, authorities said. The victim said that she had been in a relationship with Glay, who had been holding her against her will with physical assaults, threats and a handgun. The woman told authorities that when she tried to leave, Glay took away her phone and then prevented her from leaving his sight for days at the time. Glay is due to appear in court June 1 and is being held on a $35,000 bond.
