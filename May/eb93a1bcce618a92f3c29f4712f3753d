Warren Sapp can still remember the five rules advised by Tony Dungy on how to stay off the cover of USA Today. Sapp appeared on the “Pivot Podcast” last week, and relayed the five tenets to avoid, spoken by his former Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach: • Out past 12 midnight • Going 15 miles per hour over the speed limit • Drugs or guns • Alcohol • Women you know too well or not well enough. “Look at your boy Higgs,” Sapp said, appearing to refer to former Raiders wideout Henry Ruggs. “156 miles per hour, at 2 in the morning, with a gun, a chick and drinking. He hit the five. When Allen Iverson got pulled over that one time, 93 miles per hour at 2 in the morning with a gun. Only thing he didn’t have was the drugs, alcohol or some of that.” Sapp, 49, continued to hammer home the point. “It’s the five,” he said. “Tony Dungy laid that thing out for us, dog. And I’m telling you, that thing will keep hitting you over and over and over again, man.” Sapp’s 13-year career on the defensive line spanned from 1995 through 2007. He played nine years with the Bucs and his final four seasons with the Raiders. He was a seven-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro, the 1999 Defensive Player of the Year and a member of the 2002-03 Super Bowl champions. Dungy, now a commentator for NBC Sports, coached Tampa Bay from 1996 through 2001, then the Colts from 2002 through 2008, winning the Super Bowl in the 2006 season.
