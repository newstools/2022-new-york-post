Noah Syndergaard was always up for some social-media trolling during his time with the Mets, and now he’s turning it against his former team. After Angels rookie Reid Detmers threw a no-hitter Tuesday night, Syndergaard posted about it on his Instagram Story, writing, “This is what a ‘real’ no hitter looks like.” Eleven days earlier, five Mets pitchers combined for the first no-hitter in MLB this season and the second in franchise history. Syndergaard took to Twitter Wednesday afternoon to say his post “was about Reid” and his “rarity” of a no-hitter. “Mets have a good team, enjoy that instead of stirring s–t. As do the Angels, so drop the drama and move on,” Syndergaard wrote. In a follow-up tweet, Syndergaard wrote, “Oh and to be clear, I don’t think a combined no hitter is the same as ‘real’ 1 pitcher no hitter.” The 29-year-old right-hander left the Mets in free agency, signing a one-year, $21 million deal with the Angels. The Mets offered Syndergaard, who spent seven seasons in Flushing, the $18.4 million qualifying offer after he missed all of 2020 and pitched just two innings in 2021 due to Tommy John surgery. Then, as The Post’s Joel Sherman reported, Syndergaard got radio silence from the Mets, so with the Angels in pursuit he went to Anaheim to try to set himself up for a potential long-term deal after this season. Things in Anaheim have gone well so far for Syndergaard, who has a 2.45 ERA, 1.06 WHIP and 21 strikeouts in 29 1/3 innings.
