Sisters Wynonna and Ashley Judd are partnering with CMT and Sandbox Live on a public memorial special to honor their late mother, Naomi. “Naomi Judd: A River of Time Celebration” will go live from Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, at 6 p.m. Sunday, May 15. Musical performances and appearances for the commercial-free broadcast will be announced in the coming days, CNN reported. “We are sincerely privileged to work alongside Wynonna and Ashley to present this live celebration of life for their mother Naomi,” a statement about the event read, according to the network. “While we all continue to deeply mourn the loss of such a legendary artist, we are honored to commemorate her legacy alongside the country community, her friends, family and legions of fans across the world at the perfect venue: The Mother Church of Country Music. This special will celebrate her timeless voice, unforgettable spirit and the immense impact she left on our genre through the best form of healing we have — music.” The Judd girls announced their 76-year-old mom’s death on April 30, due “to the disease of mental illness.” People reported that the country superstar died by suicide, but on May 3, a rep for Naomi told The Post that her death is pending investigation by law enforcement and the coroner’s office.
