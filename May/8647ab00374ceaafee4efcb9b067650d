Two checkbooks dominated the offseason discourse for New York’s baseball teams. Steve Cohen’s money was the primary vehicle by which most optimistic fans and analysts projected a much-improved Mets team and season. In building the highest payroll in franchise history (and second-highest in MLB), Cohen made it clear he was willing to spend to rapidly turn the Mets into contenders befitting of their big-market stature. They signed high-priced free agents Max Scherzer, Starling Marte, Mark Canha and Eduardo Escobar to achieve that goal. The trade for Chris Bassitt, with only one year of team control, was also expensive — the Mets had to part with two promising pitching prospects. In The Bronx, Hal Steinbrenner’s frugality threatened to jeopardize the Yankees’ window to contend for their first World Series since 2009. Uninterested in shelling out for the top shortstops in a deep free-agent class — Carlos Correa, Javier Baez, Corey Seager, Trevor Story, Marcus Semien — the Yankees opted to roll with the much less pricey Isiah Kiner-Falefa, whom they acquired from the Twins.
