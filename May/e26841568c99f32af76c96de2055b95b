Just when we thought we’d gotten rid of him, ex-Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed Wednesday that he’s running for a new House seat in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York District 10, left open after veteran Rep. Jerry Nadler announced he’ll run in the uptown district that now includes his Upper West Side ‘hood. Some things never change, and one of them is de Blasio never realizing he’s unwanted. He tweeted out that he’s set up an exploratory committee for the seat because “I am ready to serve to continue the fight against inequality.” Ha! That rat he tried to get killed at a Brooklyn housing project could do more for New York than the doddering fool who spent eight years being the most inept mayor New York City has ever seen. Help fight inequality? On his watch, the homeless shelter population grew 17% as the total homeless population reached record highs. His hostility to policing led to a 37% rise in murders as his time ended, along with soaring shootings and other skyrocketing crime. He waged war on quality public schools, including charters and selective middle and high schools. He sold city government favors for campaign cash and donations to his pet nonprofits. And this guy with no visible means of support has been living out of a Brooklyn hotel for over four months Progressives hate de Blasio for his persistent incompetence; everyone else, for his ideas. All despise his venality. Everyone in the 10th District should savor the chance to vote against him.
