Netflix stars Irina and Dhruv Piplani — whose lavish wedding at two separate palaces in Jaipur, India, was featured in the docu-series “The Big Day Collection 2” as well as Vogue — have listed their Tribeca pad for $5.25 million. Irina is an interior designer, while investor Piplani made partner at Goldman Sachs when he was just 29, and is the former chairman of Polaris Investments in Hong Kong. They bought the stunning seventh-floor loft at 11 Beach St. for $5.26 million in December 2020 during lockdown. Less than a year later, they listed it at a loss for $5.17 million; it’s now back on the market for $5.25 million. (Their neighbor, “Deadpool 3” director Shawn Levy, bought a penthouse in the 10-story building for $13.5 million in December and is already trying to flip it for $15 million.) As for the Piplanis’ love nest: An elevator opens directly into the entry foyer of the 2,361-square-foot home, which leads to a great room for dining and entertaining. Beyond that are a chef’s kitchen as well as a separate wing with three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms. Details include beamed ceilings and oversize windows that showcase the Woolworth Building. The listing brokers are Douglas Elliman’s Brian Logvinsky and Ryan Siciliano.
