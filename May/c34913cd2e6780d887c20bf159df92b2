Wendy’s is known for its delicious square burgers and sea salt fries. While their burgers are typically cooked to perfection, according to a previous employee of the chain, there’s a method to it. In a video, the ex-employee claimed: “The reason Wendy’s hamburger patties are always cooked so perfectly is because when they start getting close to being overcooked, they throw them in a bin. “When the bin gets full, they chop [the burgers] up and turn them into the chili.” So, per the employee, the overcooked burgers are used as a key ingredient in Wendy’s chili. This way, they ensure that only perfectly cooked burgers are going out to customers, and there is no waste. The Sun has reached out to Wendy’s for comment. Previously, a prior employee of Taco Bell revealed the reason that your order is often incorrect when you go to the drive-thru. The ex-employee cited an aspect of the drive-thru that may contribute to this. According to them, it all boils down to speed. They revealed: “A lot of people don’t know that the drive-thru is timed and it’s like a competition between neighboring [Taco Bell] stores to get the lowest times. “So when people take a long time to order in the drive-thru or there’s an order mess up it looks like bad customer service.” With speed a major part of the drive-thru process, it isn’t far-fetched for some orders to get mixed up. And, the previous employee divulged specific details as to what kind of orders are typically messed up. They claimed: “The main complaint we get [about] people’s orders being messed up is when somebody orders beans because they’re vegetarian, people accidentally add meat to their order because they’re going so fast.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
