A 20-year-old man was shot dead in broad daylight during a motorcycle sale in the Bronx, cops said. The victim – who drove down from Rockland County with three other men to buy a Kawasaki motorcycle they found on Facebook Marketplace – was shot in the head at East 144th and Exterior streets in Mott Haven around 3:40 p.m. Wednesday, authorities said. The man, whose name has not been released pending family notification, was rushed to Lincoln Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Police are looking for four suspects in connection to the deadly shooting. No arrests have been made. A gun was recovered at the scene. The incident comes two days after innocent 11-year-old Kyhara Tay was fatally shot in broad daylight by a gunman on a moped in the Foxhurst section of the Bronx, cops said. The NYPD’s latest crime statistics, last updated on Sunday, show that all seven of the major crime categories are up in the Bronx so far this year, compared to 2021.
