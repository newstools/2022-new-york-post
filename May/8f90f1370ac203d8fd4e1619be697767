You no longer have to turn to online quizzes or hit up the group chat to tell if your potential beau is into you. Dating expert Rhiannon Quinche shared a way to tell if someone has a romantic interest in you, and it’s all in their hand movements. The dating guru gave a quick way to tell if someone likes you, and you’ll have to pay close attention and get your detective hats on for this one. In a video, Quinche revealed: “I can’t remember where I heard this from, but since I heard it, I just noticed people doing it all the time. “So basically if you’re speaking to someone and they scratch the back of their hand, it means that they [like] you. “It’s some kind of subconscious grooming thing. “But honestly, you will notice people doing it, and it’s wild.” People met the comments section with nothing but jokes and banter. “They probably just have anxiety haha,” someone wrote. “Instructions unclear: I scratched the back of their hand,” another mused. “I scratched too hard, now I have eczema.” “The way I’m gonna be watching my partner’s hands now. Poor guy.” “I was talking to my aunt and she scratched the back of her hand, what does this mean,” another jokester added to the fun. “The rest of my life is going to be spent noticing people not doing that,” a final person mentioned.
