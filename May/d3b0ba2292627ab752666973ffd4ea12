Child golf phenom Xavier Perez has scored a major NIL deal before even becoming a teenager. The 12-year-old, who has won more than 250 tournaments since he began playing golf competitively nine years ago, landed a name, image and likeness deal with Cobra Puma, the company announced Friday. “Xeve’s personality, talent and love for the game is inspiring, and we’re thrilled to welcome him to the Cobra Puma Golf family,” Dan Ladd, the president of Cobra Puma golf said in a statement, according to ESPN. “He is a fantastic talent and role model, which aligns with our mission to push the game forward and inspire the next generation of golfers. We’re excited to be part of his journey.” NIL deals have become a major a story in college sports, particularly in football. Of course, it will be years before Perez reaches that level. Perez, who is represented by GSE Worldwide, also reportedly has endorsement deals with Easypost, JumboMax and OnCore. He will wear Puma apparel, footwear and accessories and play with a bag of Cobra clubs, per his undisclosed new deal. “He hits the ball further than any 12-year old I have ever seen, and when it comes to his short game, he already has hands like a professional,” agent Brett Falkoff, who also represents PGA star Bryson DeChambeau, told ESPN in a statement. “His larger-than-life personality and well-mannered demeanor will set him apart, and we feel that combined with his work ethic and passion for the game, it’s only a matter of time before he takes the golf world by storm.”
