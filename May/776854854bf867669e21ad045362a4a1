The Yankees and Aaron Judge still have almost six weeks to work out at least a one-year contract and avoid arbitration. Judge is scheduled to be the final arbitration case heard this year on June 22, The Post has learned. Braves starter Max Fried is scheduled to be the final pitching case heard, a day earlier. Because of the MLB-imposed lockout, arbitration cases were not heard as usual in February. There was not time to line up the arbitrators to hear cases during the shortened spring training and, thus, it was pushed back into the season. The Yankees and Judge were unable to come to agreement on either a long-term or one-year deal during spring training. The Yankees made a seven-year, $213.5 million extension proposal that Judge rejected, saying he would now wait until after the season when he is a free agent to discuss a multi-year pact with the Yankees. As for 2022, Judge has asked for $21 million and the Yankees countered at $17 million. The sides could still try to hammer out an agreement on a one-year deal before a hearing and there is nothing — if Judge reconsiders — from the sides reconnecting on trying to do a long-term pact. In addressing reporters before the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 5-3 on Wednesday, general manager Brian Cashman said he would not discuss negotiations of any type involving Judge. Judge is off to a brilliant start to the season. But, by rule agreed to by MLB and the Players Association, nothing that has occurred during the 2022 campaign can be used as part of the arbitration hearing to determine this year’s salary.
