Blow mom away with this thoughtful gift. Give the gift of endless, salon-quality blowouts from home with the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer, now in a limited-edition gifting package and color-way, just in time for Mother’s Day 2022. This is a perfect present for mom, but also for anyone who loves shiny, frizz-free hair without the need to keep up with a hefty hair care routine. The new color is a stunning fuchsia pink, matching the sold-out Airwrap, should you be one of the lucky few that got their hands on one. The fuchsia/nickel combo looks stunning on any bathroom counter, but that is not all that is new. Inside the stunning dark blue case also comes a free detangling comb and a vented barrel brush. The kit also comes with five styling attachments, including the new Flyaway attachment that does even more to prevent frizz, much needed in the humid summer months on the horizon. With a 4.7 star-rating and more than 2,000 reviews, now may be the perfect time to try it out for yourself. “The Dyson Supersonic™ hair dryer is engineered to protect hair from extreme heat damage, with fast drying and controlled styling to help increase smoothness by 75%, increase shine by up to 132% and decrease frizz and flyaways by up to 61%,” reads the product page. As with the Airwrap, we recommend shopping now, especially if you plan to gift to your wife or mother this year for the holiday since we never know how long Dyson will stay on the shelves.
