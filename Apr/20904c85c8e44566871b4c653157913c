Pivotal playoff positioning is on the line Friday as the Lakers host the Pelicans at 10:30 p.m. ET. But before the game tips off, be sure to catch Action Network NBA analyst Raheem Palmer’s best bet for the tilt. Even though the Lakers are desperate to climb back into the playoff picture, Palmer believes this is a good spot to fade Los Angeles. “The Lakers are playing on zero days rest after their 122-109 loss to the Utah Jazz,” Palmer says. “They’re also playing their third game in four nights.” Plus, the Pelicans have defeated the Lakers in two straight games, including a 116-108 win in New Orleans on Sunday in a game where LeBron James scored 39 points. Further, even if James and Anthony Davis, both of whom are game-time decisions tonight, are ruled in, Palmer still doesn’t think a victory is surefire. With those two players in the lineup this season, the Lakers are only 11-10. Lastly, the Lakers have played dismally since the All-Star Break. In 18 contests, it owns a 4-14 record with a -7.8 net rating. Combine all those trends with the fact the Pelicans are third in defensive rating over the last three weeks and Palmer believes the visitors have good value on Friday.
