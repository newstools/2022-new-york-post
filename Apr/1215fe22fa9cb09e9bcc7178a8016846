The lack of proven NFL ability at the tight end position is the reason why the Giants are expected to select a tight end at some point on Day 2 or 3 of the upcoming NFL Draft. That position got a bit more experienced on Thursday, when the Giants agreed to terms with Jordan Akins on a one-year contract. Akins is a four-year veteran, originally a 2018 third-round pick of the Texans. His career numbers: 58 games (23 starts), 114 receptions for 1,260 yards and three touchdowns. Akins is 30 years old, having spent four years playing minor league baseball in the Texas Rangers organization. As an outfielder, he hit .218 and gave up the sport to attend the University of Central Florida, where the 6-foot-4, 243-pound Akins played four years and caught 81 passes for 1,149 yards and eight touchdowns. Akins’ position coach with the Texans last season was Andy Bischoff, who was hired by Brian Daboll as the Giants’ tight ends coach. There is a changing of the guard at tight end for the Giants. Evan Engram, a 2017 first-round pick, left in free agency after five years and signed with the Jaguars. Veteran Kyle Rudolph arrived after 10 seasons with the Vikings but did not make an impact and was released. The only previous signing this offseason at tight end was Ricky Seals-Jones, a five-year veteran with 90 career receptions for 1,044 yards and 10 touchdowns as mostly a backup for four different teams.
