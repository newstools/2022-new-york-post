Bears receiver Byron Pringle was arrested Saturday in Florida, according to TMZ. Police booked the 28-year-old for reckless driving and driving on a suspended license, according to the report. Pringle was doing donuts on a public road with a child in the car, and became confrontational during the stop. There was also another adult male in the car, a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. Pringle recently signed a one-year deal worth $4 million and another $2 million worth of incentives with Chicago this offseason. An undrafted free agent, he played his first four seasons with the Chiefs, bouncing between the active roster and practice squad. He recorded 67 receptions for 898 yards and seven touchdowns with Kansas City, helping the team to the 2019 Super Bowl.
