The Food and Drug Administration is investigating why hundreds of consumers have reported becoming ill after eating Lucky Charms cereal, The Post has learned. On Friday, The Post reported that the sugary cereal made by General Mills is believed to be making people sick, with consumers complaining that they began vomiting and experiencing diarrhea after eating a bowl of Lucky Charms. Since then, more than 400 people have flooded iwaspoisoned.com — a website that tracks foodborne illnesses. Some have complained that their poop turned green. Now the Food and Drug Administration said it’s aware of the reports “and is looking into the matter,” the agency told The Post. “The FDA takes seriously any reports of possible adulteration of a food that may also cause illnesses or injury,” an FDA spokesperson said in a statement, adding, “Depending on the seriousness of the problem, an FDA investigator may visit the person who made the complaint, collect product samples, and initiate inspections.” “The complaints are also discussed with company management during these inspections,” the spokesperson added, declining to say whether the FDA had contacted General Mills. General Mills told The Post last week that it did not believe its cereal was making people sick, but it conceded that there is an “ongoing review” of the matter. Nearly 140 people from July 2021 to March 2022 reported via Iwaspoisoned.com that they got sick after eating Lucky Charms. General Mills did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
