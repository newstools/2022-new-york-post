Roughly 100 animals died during a raging fire at the pet-stuffed home of an animal-hoarding Florida couple, officials said. The deadly tally inside the Jacksonville home has totaled 91 cats, nine dogs and a bird so far. No humans were injured in the blaze, according to a report. Sources told First Coast News that a couple lived in the home and rescued and cared for local cats and other wayward creatures. Local animal control officers had visited the residence previously and found that the animals were not being abused or mistreated. “That’s not the issue,” a local vet who examined some of the cats for the couple told the outlet. “Collecting them is the issue, not inadequate care. They get most of the cats fixed at the Humane Society. They just don’t know when to say no.” The vet characterized the homeowners as animal “hoarders.” Concerned neighbors twice reported the couple for animal cruelty but investigators never found any obvious signs of neglect. Jacksonville does not limit the number of cats that can reside in a single home. Local fire officials did not release a cause of the blaze.
