A perv tried to sexually assault a woman in broad daylight at Grand Army Plaza after following her out of the nearby train station, police said. The creep trailed behind the 29-year-old woman as she left the Grand Army Plaza 2 and 3 subway station around 12:15 p.m. Sunday, cops said. The suspect then masturbated in front of the victim and forced her onto a bench – where he tried to sexually assault her, police said. Then he bolted, fleeing into Prospect Park through the Grand Army Plaza entrance, cops said. Cops released a photo late Monday of the suspect, shown wearing sunglasses, a gray mask, a black and white hat and light-colored clothing, inside the station.
