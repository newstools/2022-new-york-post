Tiger Woods already has admitted he feels lucky to be alive after the injuries he sustained in a serious single-car wreck nearly 14 months ago in California. There was legitimate uncertainty and outright doubt over whether we’d ever see him tee it up again competitively, let alone at The Masters, where he has confirmed he will play this week with a firm goal of contending for his sixth green jacket at Augusta National. In that regard, Woods just making it to the first tee box on Thursday clearly is a win for him and for all of us who will be fixated on him throughout, hopefully, the next four days.
