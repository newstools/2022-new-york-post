A man dropped two dogs and a cat from his 14th-floor apartment before leaping off a Lower East Side building Thursday afternoon, police sources said. The 51-year-old man jumped from 575 Grand Street around 3:30 p.m., sources said. The cat and one of the dogs died while the other dog broke its legs, according to the sources. The man was taken to Beth Israel Hospital with “severe trauma” and died a short time later, the sources said. The NYPD did not immediately have any info on the incident. The FDNY confirms a patient was transported to the hospital from the location. The incident left neighbors in the building horrified. “This just ruined my whole day. I hope I don’t know this man because I’ll be sad. Really sad,” said one resident.   “Something like this has never happened around here for all I know.” “Why would he do that to those poor animals? They don’t deserve that. Lord knows why he jumped but they don’t deserve that,” said another resident of the building that didn’t want to be identified.
