Horrifying video shows New Mexico pupils getting flung across their school bus in a crash with a street-racing driver going more than 110 mph. The footage released this week by police in Albuquerque shows 23 middle-school kids chatting calmly inside the bus — until some suddenly start screaming as a white Ford Mustang races straight at them. All the youngsters in view are then flung in the air and violently tossed across the bus as it gets knocked over on its side. The 23 youngsters inside continue screaming and calling for help, with at least two suffering “significant injuries” and broken bones that required surgery, police said in an arrest affidavit. The Feb. 23 crash crumpled the Mustang, which was initially partially on fire, the police report said. Mustang driver Mario Perez, 49, admitted to the bus driver that he’d been going at least 80 mph when he crashed in the intersection, the report said. However, witnesses told police that he’d been racing another Mustang and going “in excess of 110mph” — nearly three times the 40 mph limit, the affidavit said. The school bus driver was going just 9 mph when hit, police said. Perez was also injured, and appeared in court earlier this month in a wheelchair with both legs in braces, KOB-TV said. He remains in custody after being charged with two counts of great bodily harm by vehicle, a third-degree felony, police said. The grandfather of one of the injured girls told KOB-TV that the terrifying crash would be “something that stays with them for a while.” “These kids are going to go through this trauma for a while because every time they get on the bus they’re going to remember what happened,” said Alfred Lucero, whose 13-year-old granddaughter, Lyla Maldanado, needed surgery for a fractured pelvis.
