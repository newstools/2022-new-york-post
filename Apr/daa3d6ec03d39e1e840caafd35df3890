The Peconic Land Trust just beat out power couple Jay-Z and Beyoncé to preserve another key property on Georgica Pond. Ana Meier — daughter of architect Richard Meier — and her husband Daniel Creighton sold 2.7 acres of prime waterfront land at 18 Jones Creek Lane in East Hampton to the trust. Jay-Z and Beyoncé bought their dream house at 81 Briar Patch Road for $26 million in 2017. Jay-Z, we hear, “really wanted the [additional] property and kept bidding it up until the owners finally decided to sell it for preservation,” an inside source said. Originally listed for $11.75 million last year with Town & Country Real Estate’s Linda Batiancela, the property just closed for $8.5 million. “There were multiple offers before the Peconic Land Trust contacted me in early November to discuss,” Batiancela said. “The owners decided to pass on other higher offers and make a deal with the trust for preservation purposes.” The property is adjacent to the Fulling Mill Farm Preserve and less than a mile to the ocean.
