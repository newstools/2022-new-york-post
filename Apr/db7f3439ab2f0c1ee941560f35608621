Jena Sims is giving fans a glimpse into her romance with golfer Brooks Koepka. In a recent Instagram Q&A, the 33-year-old actress and philanthropist was asked by a fan if Koepka, 31, was “the first slide into the DMs or just the most successful slide,” according to a screenshot from Egotastic Sports. Sims responded that it was she who slid into Koepka’s DMs. The longtime couple, who first crossed paths at the 2015 Masters, is set to tie the knot this summer following their March 2021 engagement. Sims recently supported Koepka at the Masters earlier this month, with the pair participating in the Par 3 contest before the actual tournament got underway. Ahead of the Masters, Sims released her shoe collaboration with Steve Madden, which features three different styles. “You can wear them to play golf or you could just wear them to go watch golf, which is how I will be utilizing them cause I don’t play golf,” Sims recently told The Post. Sims, who has shared her looks from golf tournaments on social media over the years, added that she hopes to expand further into golf fashion in the future. “One of my big goals is to break more into golf fashion because my posts on Instagram, they’ve really taken off because people like to see what I wear to golf tournaments because that’s my number one question in my DMs — other than anything about Brooks — the number one question about myself is like, ‘I’m going to the Masters this weekend, what do I wear?'” Sims said. Beyond connecting with her Instagram audience, which is close to nearly 250,000 followers, Sims is gearing up for her and Koepka’s big day. “We’re not too hung up on just the extravagance, we want — at the end of the day, we’re marrying each other, we already feel like we’re married,” she said. “We just want everyone to have a good time, and not stress about some of the big details.”
