About 200 members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Georgia were met by counter-protesters as they gathered at Stone Mountain to commemorate the group’s unofficial “Memorial Day.” Demonstrators, roughly 100 in all, shouted expletives and held signs in support of “racial justice” and “black lives matter.” “Nothing historic with regard to the Civil War happened at this park,” Gerald Griggs, Atlanta attorney and president of the state conference of the NAACP, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “So there’s no need to memorialize traitors to the American democracy.” Georgia State Patrol kept the two sides separated and the rally ended peacefully with no notable clashes or arrests reported.
