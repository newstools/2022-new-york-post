A sick sex fiend snuck into a Queens woman’s apartment while she was sleeping and sexually molested her when she tried to chase him out, cops said Tuesday. The 49-year-old was in her home at 188th Street and 64th Avenue in Fresh Meadows around 4 p.m. March 29, when she woke up to find the intruder standing over her holding a cellphone, police said. As the victim bravely tried to drive the man from her apartment, he abruptly turned toward her  and threw her against a wall, pinning her hands, authorities said. He then sexually abused her before bolting, police said. The victim was taken to Flushing Hospital Medical Center, where she was treated for a knee injury and released. About a half-hour later at 185th Street and 186th Lane, cops believe the same suspect entered a shed through an unlocked back gate and removed a Razor scooter worth about $370, as well as power tools. Police were still looking for him Tuesday.
