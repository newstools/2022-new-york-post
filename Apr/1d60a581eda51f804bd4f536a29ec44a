Colin Kaepernick can still sling it. The embattled 34-year-old quarterback, who last played in the NFL in 2017, put on a throwing exhibition for scouts and team personnel in attendance at Michigan football’s spring game, at the invitation of coach Jim Harbaugh. Throwing to undrafted and free agent receivers, Kaepernick looked good, including a deep bomb that found his receiver’s hands on his final pass. “That I can help make you a better team,” Kaepernick told WXYZ Detroit when asked what his message was to NFL teams. “I can help you win games. I know right now the situation likely won’t allow me to come in and step into a starting role. I know I’ll be able to work my way to that though and show that very quickly. “To the teams that have questions, more than anything I’d say I’d love to come in for a workout, I’d love to sit down with you and have that conversation about how I can help you be a better team.” Kaepernick, formerly a starter who took the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, has been out of the league for five years and is widely believed to have been blackballed after he caught criticism for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. Though other players, such as safety Eric Reid, also kneeled, Kaepernick was the face of the movement, which caused then-President Donald Trump to call him a “son of a bitch.” Harbaugh, who coached Kaepernick in San Francisco, has been supportive of him in the past. By having him throw at halftime of the spring game, Harbaugh essentially gave scouts an excuse to see Kaepernick live. The exhibition was sponsored by Wolverines Against Racism, a student organization at the university. It seems unlikely at this point that any team would sign Kaepernick, but he’s made it clear that he’s ready, willing and able to play professional football.
