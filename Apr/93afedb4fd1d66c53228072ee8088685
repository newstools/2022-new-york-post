Mac Jones has another weapon at his disposal. The Patriots acquired wide receiver DeVante Parker and a fifth-round pick from the Dolphins, sending a 2023 third-round draft pick to Miami in return, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter. For Miami, the deal amounts to offloading Parker’s $8.7 million cap hit for 2022. New England also adds a receiver who has a career 24 touchdowns and more than 4,700 yards receiving over seven seasons in Miami, though he is coming off a year in which he had just 515 yards in 10 games for the Dolphins. Parker’s 40 catches last year were also down from the prior two seasons. He crossed the 1,000-yard threshold for the only time in 2019 when he went for a career-high 1,202 yards. For a roster that was missing a true No. 1 receiver last year, with Jakobi Meyers leading the team in receiving yards with 866 yards and scoring just two touchdowns, Parker could fill that role for the Patriots if he can stay healthy and jell with Jones. According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Parker wanted a team with stability, which the Patriots provide in bulk. Should Parker, who was plagued by a hamstring injury last year, be able to stay on the field and play to his potential, he would be expected to produce at a high level for the Patriots.
