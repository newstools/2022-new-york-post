Thank you, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, for finally spelling out unequivocally that America wants to see Russia defeated in full. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin told reporters after he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken became the highest-level US officials to visit Kyiv since Russia invaded Feb. 24. More, Austin noted after a sitdown with officials from dozens of nations: “Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here.” Sadly, this is the first time a top Bidenite has been so clear. His boss, President Joe Biden, keeps implying that Russia might yet get away with seizing part of Ukraine. Not to mention the other presidential gaffes such as calling for Putin’s ousting, talk of using chemical weapons against Russia (we don’t have any) and telling US troops they’re headed into the war zone. Worst is the way Biden keeps buying the Russians’ bluster about potential nuclear war, which led him to personally veto the transfer of MiG fighters from Poland to Ukraine after both Blinken and Austin had signed off. At this point, the world will be better off if the president just let Austin and Blinken not just speak for the United States, but run the entire US response to Vladimir Putin’s war.
