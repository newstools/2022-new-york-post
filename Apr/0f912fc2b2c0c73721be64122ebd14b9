Our old friend Jussie Smollett has released a song. Smollett was convicted for lying to police after the 2019 racist attack on him was found to be staged. His song is called “Thank You God.” Some snippets suggest Smollet is maintaining he is innocent. “Y’all better look at someone else … you think I’m stupid … you got the wrong one.” Other songs from the album include “Ebony & Ivory,” “Masquerade,” “Act Naturally” and “Would I Lie To You?” The Angels are ready to soar again. Mike Trout is back and Noah Syndergaard has joined Shohei Ohtani to provide a solid 1-2 at the top of the rotation. (Wonder what those two guys talk about at the team breakfast.) Ohtani held Houston to one run over 4 ²/₃ in his first outing. He pitches in Texas where Dane Dunning gets the start for the Rangers. The Jays scored three runs in five frames on Dunning in his opener. Play 10 units on the Angels. Ben Gamel hit a three-run homer off Kyle Hendricks and the Pirates went on to club the Cubs 6-2. Down -100 kessingers.
