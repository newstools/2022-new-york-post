New York has hit another ugly milestone: The Anti-Defamation League reports that the state led the nation in anti-Semitic incidents in 2021, with a 24% jump over 2020. And like clockwork, just ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day, our legislative masterminds have derailed a bill to require a look at how New York public schools are teaching Holocaust history. Those hate-crime numbers are even uglier up close: 183 incidents of harassment, nearly as many cases of vandalism — and a terrifying 51 assaults, up an eye-popping 325% over 2020 and the highest ever recorded since the ADL started keeping track in 1979. Attacks on Jewish institutions, like synagogues and schools, jumped 41%. Some 60% of the incidents hit in New York City, and 94% of the assaults — two-thirds of them in Brooklyn, targeting mainly Orthodox and Hasidic Jews. The ‘burbs also saw bad news, with incident numbers leaping 28% in Westchester and 100% in Rockland County. One slight silver lining: The country as a whole saw a 34% jump, worse than New York’s 24%. But the Empire State, with 6% of the US population, still accounts for 15% of anti-Semitic incidents nationwide. What to do? Common-sense solutions leap out, like more cops in the affected neighborhoods. And progressives need to call out the anti-Semites in their ranks. A massive spike in 2020 hate crimes at the time of the Israel-Hamas war was likely driven by  hateful far-left rhetoric on Israel’s right to defend itself. Some lawmakers need calling out, too: the Democrats who stonewalled when asked why they obstructed a law on Holocaust education. This, when 19% of younger New Yorkers, per a 2020 study, think Jews caused the Holocaust, while 10% either didn’t think the Holocaust happened or were unsure about its reality. “Never again” needs to be more than an empty slogan. Shame on our lawmakers for putting roadblocks in the way of remedying that horrifying ignorance.
