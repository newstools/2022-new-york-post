Was the floor defective in Monday’s NCAA championship game between Kansas and North Carolina? Tar Heels fans are sick over speculation that the floorboards of the court inside the Caesars Superdome were loose. In slow-motion footage circulating online, UNC forward Armando Bacot is seen dribbling to the basket during a crucial possession with under a minute left in the game – and the court appears to move under his feet as he rolled his ankle. Bacot turned the ball over and it was a wrap from there, with the top-seeded Jayhawks mounting a historic comeback to defeat UNC, 72-69. The 6-foot-11 junior recorded 15 points, 15 rebounds, and two assists in the crushing loss. “I was just trying to drive to the basket,” Bacot said after the game. “And I just kind of unconsciously tried to go up off my right foot. And then that was the ankle that was injured. And I just rolled it again.” Bacot was already playing injured after he rolled the same ankle in Saturday’s win over Duke. He briefly exited with 5:18 to play in the second half before he checked back in and finished the game. The court at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans was temporary, as the multi-purpose stadium is also home to the Saints.
