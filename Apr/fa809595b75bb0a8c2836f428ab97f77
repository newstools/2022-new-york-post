The world’s richest man said he doesn’t own a home and sleeps in his friends’ spare bedrooms for the most part. In a recent interview with TED’s Chris Anderson, Elon Musk says he has resorted to couch surfing. “I don’t even own a place right now, I’m literally staying at friends’ places,” explained Musk, whose estimated net worth is $269.5 billion, according to Forbes. “If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla’s engineering is, I basically rotate through friends’ spare bedrooms,” the father of seven added. Despite the Tesla and SpaceX founder’s surprising lifestyle, the billionaire tech magnate did reveal the one luxury he indulges in. When answering a question about the wealth disparity in the US between average Americans and billionaires like himself, Musk said, “For sure, it would be very problematic if I was spending billions of dollars a year in personal consumption, but that is not the case.” “It’s not as though my personal consumption is high,” he continued, admitting that his private plane is the only exception. “If I don’t use the plane, then I have less hours to work,” he added. In June last year, Musk tweeted that his primary residence is a rental from SpaceX, worth $50,000. What’s more, the residence was conveniently near the company’s Texas location. In the tweet, also admitted to owning an “events house” in the Bay Area. In May 2020, Musk famously tweeted, “I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.”
