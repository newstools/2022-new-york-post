A trick but not a treat. Lunch ladies in Florida were in the April Fools’ mood this year and played a practical joke on their young students. Pre-K teacher Tiffany Page shared a funny TikTok video of the joke, which has now been viewed 256,700 times. The clip shows several lunch trays set with cheeseburgers, smiley face-shaped fries, fruit and milk — plus a colorful, and deceptive, Easter egg to complete the meal. Page films two of her students opening the mystery egg to reveal a healthy snack. “Broccoli,” the young students say, clearly disappointed as the green veggie sprouts out of the plastic eggs, which are commonly used to hide candy. The video was recorded as the students collected trays of food for lunch last Friday on April Fools’ Day, which is just a few weeks out from Easter. A surprising number of parents noted that their children would actually be happy to get an Easter egg filled with broccoli. “But those are the saddest looking lunches already. Now it just comes with a side of extra disappointment,” one viewer commented, while another joked, “Emotional damage!!” “And that’s how the riot started … ” one shocked viewer teased. But many others left comments in support of the “funny” and “cute” prank to get the young students in a giggly mood. “I’m loving these cute school jokes,” said one supporter, with someone adding, “This is a harmless prank I love this.” Another seemed to feel a pang of nostalgia. “This would’ve been so funny to us as kids,” they wrote. “How awesome to have lunch ladies that remember being a kid.”
