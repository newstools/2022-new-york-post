TAMPA — Greg Bird is back with the Yankees. The 29-year-old first baseman signed a minor league deal with the team on Tuesday, sources confirmed. Bird will report to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where the Yankees previously stashed Ronald Guzman, who was also in camp on a minor league deal. Anthony Rizzo is the first baseman, with DJ LeMahieu and perhaps Marwin Gonzalez able to fill in there. But they don’t have much depth in the organization at the spot after trading Luke Voit to the Padres. Ronald Guzman, who was in Yankee camp on a minor league deal, is also slated to be at SWB to open the season. Bird opted out of his minor league deal with the Blue Jays on Monday after being informed he wouldn’t make their 40-man roster, despite playing well during spring training. The move brings the lefty-swinging Bird back to the team that drafted him in 2011. He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 2015, hitting 11 homers in 46 games. But injuries soon derailed his career, as he missed the 2016 season due to a torn labrum in his shoulder during the offseason that required surgery. Ankle and foot injuries that limited him to just 140 games from 2017-2019. “You always think [what if],” Bird said this spring of his Yankees tenure. “But you look back on the past and learn from it, not dwell on it. It’s fun to reminisce and talk about. I’ll forever hold memories that I had with [Aaron Judge] and other guys. But it happened the way it happened and you can’t change it. We had fun and I’m looking forward to watching him play and playing against him now.” Judge said last month Bird is one of the best hitters he has played with. “I still believe that,” Judge said.
