Ed Marinaro certainly made the most of his stage time during Friday’s second round of the NFL Draft in Las Vegas. The actor and former Minnesota Vikings running back was tapped to announce his former team’s second-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft but took his time before reading the name card. Marinaro regaled the eager Las Vegas crowd with stories about being drafted 50 years ago while sitting in his small apartment and about how the crowd in Las Vegas was bigger than that of the Super bowl he played in. He kept going, too, talking about how he was drafted by the team that he wanted to be drafted by the second least. He then said, “but I won’t bring up the Packers,” taking a dig at his former NFC rival. The draft runs on a tight clock, though, with each team having only 7 minutes to make their selection during the second round. The picks were also flying in on Friday, with many coming before the time expired. Marinaro needed help sticking to the timeline, so a producer walked on stage to urge him to read the card already. After trading up for the pick, Marinaro finally read the name of Andrew Booth, cornerback out of Clemson, and the rest of the draft could finally carry on.
