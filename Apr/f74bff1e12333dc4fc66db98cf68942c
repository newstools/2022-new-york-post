“Spider-Man” star Tom Holland recently moved into a rental at Waterline Square — the new three-tower luxury condo complex on the Upper West Side, Gimme has learned. And gal pal Zendaya — the Emmy-award winning 25-year-old “Euphoria” star — has been spotted there regularly, neighbors say. The couple have been linked as an item since they starred in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” in 2017 and remain supportive of each other on social media, where Zendaya has 137 million followers on Instagram. Holland — the English actor who plays Marvel’s Peter Parker, while Zendaya has played his classmate, MJ — once told GQ how Zendaya keeps him grounded. “Having her in my life was so instrumental to my sanity. She is so good at being the role model for young guys and girls,” he said. They were also snapped holding hands last February, leaving the Crosby Street Hotel. Holland, who has posted some adorable photos of himself with some puppies last February, might be interested to know that “Doggy Doula” Colleen Safford — who has trained pooches for Vogue editrix Anna Wintour and Michael J. Fox — has opened Far Fetched New York, her first puppy club at Waterline Square. It was designed by Safford with Tangram. Zendaya, meanwhile, owns her own Brooklyn condo at Quay Tower, as Gimme reported exclusively.
