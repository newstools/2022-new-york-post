The 76ers will be playing in the second round of the NBA playoffs, but likely without Joel Embiid. Embiid sustained a right orbital fracture and a minor concussion during Thursday’s 132-97 series-clinching win over the Raptors, and there is reportedly no timetable for the star center’s return with the 76ers set to face the Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals beginning Monday. With four minutes left during Game 6, Embiid took an elbow to the face from Toronto’s Pascal Siakam, who was given an offensive foul. Embiid sat on the bench for the remainder of the game. As the Philly star walked off the court, Raptors fans chanted “f–k Embiid.” Embiid tallied 33 points and 10 rebounds in 36 minutes. Losing Embiid would be devastating for the Sixers as they approach the series against the top-seeded Heat. Miami will be entering Monday’s Game 1 with injury questions around star players as well: Jimmy Butler (knee) and Kyle Lowry (hamstring) missed Tuesday’s series clincher against the Hawks.
