A trio violently mugged a 76-year-old woman in a Bronx building over the weekend, disturbing new video shows. The senior was entering the lobby at Roberts and Hobart avenues in Pelham Bay around 12:30 a.m. Sunday when the three suspects approached and one of them pulled her hair, police said. The victim is shown trying to close the door on the muggers, but to no avail. Once inside the lobby, one of the suspects – who appeared to be a teen or young woman – grabbed hold of the elderly victim’s purse and swung her around until she fell to the floor in the lobby, according to cops and the video. The crew then took off with the purse, holding $50, a wallet, a debit card, and insurance cards, police said. The senior was taken to Jacobi Medical Center with a fractured hip, police said. The suspects fled on foot toward Hobart Avenue and are still being sought, cops said.
