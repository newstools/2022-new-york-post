TikTok is set to take center stage. The popular social media platform has ordered its first-ever fully funded musical, which is set to be streamed through the app in April, according to Variety. The musical, titled “For you, Paige,” will be helmed by Daniel Mertzlufft — the creative force behind the viral “Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical,” which debuted on Jan. 1, 2021. “For you, Paige” was inspired by real-life content creators and features all original music written by Mertzlufft and several others, and orchestrations by Macy Schmidt. The musical follows Landon, an up-and-coming TikTok creator, who is thrust into the spotlight after a song he debuts goes viral. He ends up leaving his friends behind after landing a gig transforming the song into a full-fledged musical and learning that he can’t do everything alone. Mertzlufft, who has been working on the show since January of this year, has been documenting the creative process behind “For You, Paige” on his TikTok, giving users a unique behind-the-scenes look at how the musical is made. The cast of “For you, Paige” will feature all content creators and will be livestreamed on the official TikTok account from a Broadway theater on April 14, 2022, at 7 p.m. Mertzlufft’s previous work, “Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical,” became an instant internet sensation. Based on the song “Remy the Ratatouille” by Emily Jacobson, it raised a resounding $1.9 million for the Actors Fund during the COVID-19 pandemic and featured Broadway stars such as Adam Lambert, Tituss Burgess and Wayne Brady.
