It’s not a Shakespearean tragedy, but it’s still bad news for Broadway. Several performances of the new “Macbeth” were canceled after star Daniel Craig tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday. “We apologize for the inconvenience this causes ticket holders, but the safety of our audiences, the cast and crew remains our top priority,” producers said in a social media post. The show first announced the 007 actor’s positive test and the cancellation of Saturday’s matinee and evening performance, but said later Saturday that it was canceling all performances through Thursday “due to the detection of a limited number of positive covid test results within the company.” Refunds will be given for the canceled shows at the point of purchase, show organizers said. The show had just begun preview performances Tuesday at the Longacre Theatre on West 48th Street. It’s set to open April 28 and run through July. Craig plays the title role while Ruth Negga plays Lady Macbeth in her Broadway debut. With Post wires
