Odell Beckham Jr.’s shoe closet would, on its own, comprise a luxurious New York City apartment. The free agent wide receiver has listed his 13,800 square foot home in Columbia Station, Ohio — about 25 miles from the Browns’ FirstEnergy Stadium — for $3.3 million. The house has four bedrooms, seven bathrooms and an expansive yard. There’s a theater room with a massive projection screen, and a game room with a pool table and ping-pong table. There’s a gym with a basketball hoop. Outdoors, there’s a pool with a water slide. But the most striking image from the home is the sneaker closet. In it, there are hundreds of pairs of shoes. There is so much space, the closet even has its own lounge chairs. Even with them, there’s still plenty of room to wander around the room. There are also racks of clothing, with space to spare, in what looks more like a sporting goods store than a closet. Of course with more than $80 million in career earnings, per Spotrac, it’s no wonder the stylish receiver has a vast shoe collection. As for where he’ll land next, though, that’s perhaps more uncertain than his home’s next owner. Beckham Jr. joined the Browns before the 2019 season but less than three years later the team released him during the 2021 season after failing to find a willing trade partner. The situation between the two sides had become especially untenable when Beckham’s father distributed a video of his son being wide open but not thrown to by quarterback Baker Mayfield. Shortly after his release, Beckham Jr.  joined the Rams, where he was a significant contributor during their run to a Super Bowl title. But he sustained a torn ACL in the victory, leading to more questions about his future with Los Angeles. The Rams this offseason also signed former Bears wide receiver Allen Robinson II to a three-year, $46.5 deal, making Beckham Jr.’s return even more uncertain.
