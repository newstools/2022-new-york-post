New York Jews torched leavened bread in bonfires in designated areas across the city Friday to mark the start of Passover. The biur chametz outside Yetev Lev D’Satmar Synagogue in Borough Park, Brooklyn, saw the Jewish community gather to observe the tradition — where all leavened products are to be burned ahead of the start of Passover seder at sundown. FDNY Engine 517 oversaw the location, distributed fire safety pamphlets — and extinguished the flames after the leavened products had been reduced to ash. Passover, which will last eight days, honors the Bible story of the Exodus of the Jewish people from Egypt.
