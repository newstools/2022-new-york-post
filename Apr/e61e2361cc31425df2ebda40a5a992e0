Charles Barkley guaranteed a Kansas victory over North Carolina in the NCAA Tournament championship game – and made sure Kenny Smith felt the Tar Heels loss. After the Jayhawks beat the Tar Heels, 72-69 — and pulled off the biggest comeback in men’s NCAA Final history Monday night — Barkley taunted his “Inside the NBA” co-host, who was an All-American at North Carolina from 1983-87. During the post-game broadcast, Smith appeared unamused while Barkley sang in his ear, and danced to “YMCA.” Barkley continuously poked Smith and grabbed his shoulders while he sat in a sorrow over the loss. Just two nights prior, Smith was whistling a much different tune when his Tar Heels eliminated their rival Duke from the Final Four in a 81-77 win last Saturday. Barkley, in the postgame TBS show on Saturday, guaranteed a Jayhawks national title. “Not only are they going to play for a national championship on Monday, they are going to win the national championship Monday,” Barkley said at the time. It was all in good fun between the TNT hosts after Kansas’ historic comeback to win the Jayhawks their fourth NCAA title.
