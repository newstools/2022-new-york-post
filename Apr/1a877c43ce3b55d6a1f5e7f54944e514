A new study has ranked the sexiest cities in the world and TWO American hotspots have made the cut. Las Vegas and New York City are among the kinkiest destinations around the globe, sex experts say. London is rated as the city with the kinkiest energy in The Bottle Club’s latest study where they ranked the sexiest cities on a 40-point scale. Las Vegas follows shortly behind London’s near-perfect score of 39 with a score of 38. Berlin comes in third place with 33 points, and New York City is in the top four with a score of 29. In order to determine each city’s sexiness score, many factors were taken into account — they were ranked on the number of kinky people, sex events, and pornstars named after the city. The number of people in the area that are signed up for websites like OnlyFans was also taken into account. London leads the way due to a whopping 131 sex events and 10,000 content creators on OnlyFans. There are also at least 30 porn stars named after the city of London. Las Vegas is home to 115 strip clubs and 88 sex events, proving that it’s called Sin City for a reason. While NYC ranked third, it also got points with the study for having some of the world’s most sensual menus, as the city is full of champagne bars and oyster restaurants. Oslo, Norway, was named as the least kinky city with zero porn stars named Oslo, and less than 100 content creators on OnlyFans. Besides finding the world’s kinkiest cities, the Bottle Club also ranked the world’s most seductive cities — where Las Vegas and NYC were both in the top three. Paris surprisingly didn’t even rank in the study’s top 20 most seductive cities, though it’s known as the City of Love. However, it was revealed that the city has the highest number of one-hour hotels out of anywhere in the world. The study named Copenhagen, Capetown, and Brussels as the least seductive cities in the world. This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
