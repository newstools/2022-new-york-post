The Forest Hills mom whose butchered body was found stuffed in a duffel bag had once been reported missing by her husband — after she went for a midnight stroll and didn’t come home, police sources said Monday. Orsolya Gaal’s hubby Howard Klein called 911 around 7:21 a.m. May 29, 2020, to report his wife missing, telling cops she went for a walk around 12:30 a.m. and hadn’t returned, sources told The Post. Klein, 53, told the emergency operator his wife wasn’t in their Juno Street house in Queens when he woke up that morning, sources said. Then he called back about 30 minutes later to say she’d been found, sources said. The bizarre incident only added to the continuing mystery shrouding Gaal’s murder Saturday morning. More than 48 hours into the investigation, cops have yet to name a suspect or even person of interest in her gruesome slaying. Here’s what we know so far about the events leading up to Gaal’s death: “Everybody’s on edge because a killer is running around, who just butchered someone yards from our homes, and they are still at large,” neighbor Nick Bais said. “The police-crime unit mobile laboratory was here all last night with the lights flashing. No one slept.”
