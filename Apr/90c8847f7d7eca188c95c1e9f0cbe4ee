The perv who allegedly accosted a woman at a Queens subway station and then tried to sexually assault her inside a building lobby has been arrested, cops said Thursday. Roy Higgins, 29, who is homeless, was nabbed Wednesday and charged with attempted criminal sex act, public lewdness and unlawful imprisonment in connection to the April 21 incident, cops said. Higgins approached the 22-year-old victim inside the Main Street station in Flushing around 9:45 a.m. that day, grabbed her by the arm and forced her to walk upstairs and out of the station, police said. He then forced her to walk with him down Main Street toward Kissena Boulevard, and brought her into the lobby of a building, cops said. There, Higgins “forcibly restrained” the victim and exposed his penis, police said. The brave victim managed to break free and ran off to report the incident, cops said. She did not report any injuries and refused medical attention. Higgins was picked up around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, cops said. The arresting officer recognized him from a previous public lewdness bust on April 19, police said. In that case, Higgins allegedly exposed his penis and started masturbating in front of a 54-year-old woman on an elevator inside a building on 171st Street near 89th Avenue in Jamaica around 10 a.m., cops said. His next court appearance for that case is scheduled for June 3, records show. Higgins has 11 other prior arrests, including busts for burglary, grand larceny, robbery, burglary and criminal mischief, cops said.
