Game 5 of Warriors-Nuggets is set to tip off Wednesday night at 10:00 p.m. ET, and Joe Dellera of the Action Network has three prop plays for the contest (video above). The first player interesting Dellera from a prop perspective is Warriors forward Draymond Green. For Green, Dellera is backing the Michigan State product over 0.5 three-pointers made. The reasoning: Green has shown this series he’s capable of knocking one down from distance. “[Green] has hit this in around 67 percent of his playoff games and in three of four games this series,” Dellera says. Add in that the Denver defense has played extremely below-average basketball this series and Dellera likes Green to extend his productivity, albeit with some thin margins. The second player prop Dellera is backing is Stephen Curry over 27.5 points. With Curry’s minutes limit off, Dellera expects the Davidson product to have a strong outing tonight at home. “Curry took 23 shots and 11 threes in Game Four…and that was still with a slight minutes restriction,” Dellera says. Against a Nuggets defense that is surrendering a high volume of three-point shots, Dellera rates this number a touch low and believes Curry is more than capable of clearing it. For his final prop, Dellera is looking to the visiting Nuggets, specifically center Nikola Jokic under 20.5 rebounds + assists.  The Nuggets have been utilizing Jokic in more of a scoring role for this series, which has led to a dropoff in his assists and rebounds production. Plus, the 2021 NBA MVP has cleared this line in only one game this series and doesn’t have a great historical record, either. “Over the last two years of Jokic in the playoffs, he’s only hit this prop in two of 14 games,” Dellera explains. For those reasons, take Nikola Jokic under his rebounds + assists prop.
