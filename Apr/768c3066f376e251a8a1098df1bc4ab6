This has been the offseason of wide receiver drama in the NFL, and it’s continuing right up until the draft. After seeing the likes of Davante Adams and Tyreek Hill reset the wide receiver market while changing teams, the San Francisco 49ers are now dealing with an issue of their own if they want to enter the 2022 season with their top offensive weapon on the field. Deebo Samuel is embroiled in heated contract discussions with the 49ers, and due to an array of reasons, he has now requested a trade. There’s no denying what Samuel provided from a production standpoint in 2021, but there appears to be a disconnect between how he wants to be utilized and how the 49ers want to deploy him. Now having requested a trade, the odds for where Samuel will play next have been posted on DraftKings: San Francisco 49ers (-250) New York Jets (+450) Philadelphia Eagles (+1000) New England Patriots (+1600) Chicago Bears (+1600) Baltimore Ravens (+1800) Kansas City Chiefs (+2000) Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+2000) Los Angeles Chargers (+2000) Tennessee Titans (+2000) Buffalo Bills (+2500) Green Bay Packers (+2500) Cleveland Browns (+2500) Dallas Cowboys (+3000) Miami Dolphins (+3000) Indianapolis Colts (+3000) New Orleans Saints (+3000) Atlanta Falcons (+3000) Pittsburgh Steelers (+5000) Denver Broncos (+5000) Jacksonville Jaguars (+5000) Detroit Lions (+5000) Washington Commanders (+5000) Houston Texans (+5000) Carolina Panthers (+5000) Cincinnati Bengals (+5000) Las Vegas Raiders (+5000) Minnesota Vikings (+5000) New York Giants (+7500) Los Angeles Rams (+10000) Arizona Cardinals (+10000) Seattle Seahawks (+10000)  The most likely scenario, according to the oddsmakers, is that Samuel stays put in San Francisco. Why wouldn’t he. Just because he has requested a trade doesn’t mean that he will be traded. As much as he may want to be traded, the 49ers have made it clear that they don’t have any intention of moving on from their prolific offensive weapon. It appears the two sides are at a stalemate of sorts, but the most likely scenario is that Samuel enters the 2022 season for his fourth season in San Francisco. As you can tell, there’s a pretty big difference between San Francisco’s -250 odds and the +500 of the New York Jets, but if any team has what it takes to get this deal done, it’s them. The Jets were in the thick of things for Tyreek Hill, and with plenty of cap space, draft capital, and a glaring need for a strong wide receiver for their second-year quarterback in Zach Wilson, The Jets could make an aggressive push to acquire Samuel’s services – assuming they could get 49ers general manager John Lynch to pick up the phone. Yes, that’s an extra zero on those odds compared to that of the Jets. The Houston Texans are still betting long shots to acquire Samuel, but there are reports indicating that they are a team to watch. It would make sense. The Texans are in the middle of a rebuild, plenty of draft capital, cap space, and a second-year quarterback that they are looking to equip with talent – all of which mirrors the situation of the Jets. The Texans have the 3rd and the 13th overall pick, and it sounds like the latter could potentially be in play for a Samuel trade. This move would give the Texans a young superstar wide receiver to complement the perpetually-underrated Brandon Cooks and second-year wide receiver Nico Collins. At +5000 odds, this might be worth a look.
