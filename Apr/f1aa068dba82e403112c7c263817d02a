Minnesota Wild forward Ryan Hartman has no regrets after flipping the bird to Oilers winger Evander Kane after their fight on the ice Tuesday in a 5-1 win over Edmonton. Hartman appeared to mouth, “F–k you,” to Kane as the referees separated the players. Then, he flipped the controversial NHL player the bird. After the game, Hartman said if he’s fined over the offensive gesture towards Kane, it will be “well worth it.” The NHL did indeed fine Hartman $4,250 on Wednesday for the incident. The scrum broke out midway through the third period in Minnesota when the Wild’s Kirill Kaprizov and Oilers winger Kailer Yamamoto checked one another on the ice — which led to Kane skating over to help his teammate. Then entered Hartman, who came to Kaprizov’s defense and pulled Kane off his teammate. Kane and Hartman got into their own scuffle before referees separated the two. Kane and Hartman were given game misconduct penalties on the play. Kane received a two-minute minor for roughing and a two-minute minor for cross-checking, while Hartman got an additional roughing minor. “It goes to show, we had five guys in there. They didn’t have one guy in there to help him,” Hartman said, according to The Athletic. “I don’t think any of their guys are going to defend him.” When asked about the scrum, Kane said, “It took all five guys and they couldn’t bring me down.” He added, “I definitely would have liked to get loose, put it that way.” As for Kane’s reaction to Hartman’s middle finger? He smiled and said, “Yeah, these little guys, they wanna act tough. They wait for the linesmen to come in.” Kane has been at the center of a number of controversies throughout his NHL career. Earlier this season, he was suspended 21 games for having a fake COVID-19 vaccination card. He was also accused of domestic abuse and gambling on NHL games by his ex-wife, though he was cleared of charges.
