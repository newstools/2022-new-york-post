A woman is facing a murder charge in Maryland for running over a man with his own car after she claims he propositioned her for sex, police said. Katie Foster, 25, was charged with first-degree murder in Sunday’s slaying of Joseph Dawson, 52, in Arbutus, where she struck the victim following an argument, Baltimore County police said in a statement Monday. Dawson was rushed to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. He had been pinned under his own car when cops responded to the scene, WBAL-TV reported. Foster told police she smoked cocaine with Dawson earlier Sunday when he suggested that they have sex. She declined the offer and got into another man’s car, according to charging documents obtained by the station. Dawson chased the pair in his car, Foster said, before hopping out of his vehicle to start fighting with the other man with her, charging documents show. Foster proceeded to jump into Dawson’s ride and slam on the accelerator, investigators said. “We do not believe this was an accident,” Baltimore County Det. Trae Corbin told the station. “We believe this was an intentional act committed by Ms. Foster.” Foster, who was being held without bond Tuesday, waived her Miranda rights and told cops she was trying to get away from Dawson at the time. Her preliminary hearing has been set for May 6, the Baltimore Sun reported.
