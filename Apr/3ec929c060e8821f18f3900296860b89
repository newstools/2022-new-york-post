A defensive coach at Jackson State University is teaching his players the “Will Smith” technique. Jackson State, an HBCU in Mississippi, is coached by Deion Sanders. Andre’ Hart, who coaches linebackers for the squad, was filmed by Sanders’ son, wide receiver Deion Sanders Jr., teaching players to deploy the “Will Smith” technique of smacking blockers en route to the quarterback. “He hit him with that palm of his hand!” Hart exclaimed. “Not the finger!” Hart then proceeded to demonstrate the technique himself on a blocking dummy. “We gon’ give him that bob, then Will Smith his ass!” he said. The video then showed Jackson State football players mimicking the strategy they were just taught, as Hart yelled for them to “Will Smith” the dummies. Earlier this month, Smith was hit hard with a 10-year ban from the Oscars for his slap of Chris Rock during this year’s ceremony, though Smith did get to keep his award for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.
