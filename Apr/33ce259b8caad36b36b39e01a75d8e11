The musical adaptation of the 1959 Billy Wilder film “Some Like It Hot” will officially open this fall after several delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Deadline. The project is helmed by Broadway veteran Christian Borle, who was previously cast in New York City Center’s production of “Into the Woods,” but was replaced by Neil Patrick Harris. Borle will play Joe/Josephine, a role originated by Tony Curtis in the film, and will be joined by J. Harrison Ghee as Jerry/Daphne, which Jack Lemmon played in the movie. Adrianna Hicks has been cast as Sugar, a role made famous by Marilyn Monroe. All three cast members have been with the show since the workshop phase and will see it move to the Great White Way. Other cast members include Kevin Del Aguila, NaTasha Yvette Williams, Adam Heller and Mark Lotito. Other cast members have yet to be announced. “Some Like It Hot” is set in Prohibition-era Chicago and follows two musicians who witness a mob hit and are forced to disguise themselves as women in an all-female band in order to escape the pursuing mobsters. The musical will feature a book by Tony Award winner Matthew López and Amber Ruffin, with music and lyrics by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, and will be directed by Casey Nicholaw. Producers of the musical announced that the show will start previews on Nov. 1, with an official opening night of Dec. 11, at the Shubert Theatre. The show was initially supposed to make its debut in Chicago but was canceled due to COVID-19.
