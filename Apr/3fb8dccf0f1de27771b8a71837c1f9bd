After a spring training that showed the Yankees might have solved their shortstop situation for the near future with Isiah Kiner-Falefa, the first week of the regular season wasn’t as promising. The former Ranger got off to a 1-for-17 start at the plate and made several miscues in the field in his first five games before turning in a sparkplug 3-for-3 performance in Thursday night’s 3-0 victory over the Blue Jays. With the organization’s top prospects at the position — Oswald Peraza, currently at  Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and Anthony Volpe, who just opened the season with Double-A Somerset — not yet on the verge of helping in The Bronx, is it fair to be concerned about Kiner-Falefa?
