Kudos to Ed Rensi for calling out corporate America’s bull. The McDonald’s ex-CEO told Fox Business that companies have “no business” being in politics as he announced the launch of The Boardroom Initiative to fight woke corporate policies. “Corporations have no business being on the right or the left because they represent everybody there and their sole job is to build equity for their investors,” the creator of the McNugget said. Absolutely. Asinine “anti-racist” diversity training (which actually demands racist thinking) and other trendy products of corporate HR woke-scolds don’t serve the workers, the shareholders or anyone else. The initiative’s members will use their shares in companies that are going down this road to raise the issue at stockholder meetings, forcing votes to end the madness. It’s an uphill battle: McKinsey consultants estimate that corporate investment in “racial justice initiatives” has topped $200 billion. The forces burning shareholder money on cockamamie nonsense won’t give up their gravy train without a fight.
