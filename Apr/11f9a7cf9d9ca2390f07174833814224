Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Tuesday that his country cannot be isolated or held back — no matter what punishment it receives — as he doubled down on his decision to invade Ukraine. “We don’t intend to be isolated,” Putin said, according to Russian state television. “It is impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world, especially such a vast country as Russia.” Putin insisted that any attempts to cut off Moscow would fail and Russia would never again depend on the West after the US and its allies imposed crippling sanctions to punish Putin for his self-described “special military operation” in Ukraine. The Russian strongman said the deadly Feb. 24 invasion was necessary because he claimed the US was using Ukraine to threaten Moscow via NATO. Putin added that Moscow was forced to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from persecution. Despite stiff resistance from Ukrainian troops and the sweeping sanctions from the West, Putin said he has no doubt Russia will achieve its “noble” objectives in Ukraine. “Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” Putin said of Russia’s military campaign. “On the one hand, we are helping and saving people, and on the other, we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself,” he added. “It’s clear that we didn’t have a choice. It was the right decision.” Putin issued the warning to the West as he marked Russia’s annual Cosmonautics Day, the anniversary of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man to enter space. Speaking alongside Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said the success of the Soviet space program was proof Russia could still achieve milestones in the face of tough conditions. “The sanctions were total, the isolation was complete but the Soviet Union was still first in space,” he said. Early Soviet space successes during the Cold War, including Gagarin’s flight and the 1957 launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite, spurred the US to create NASA. With Post wires
