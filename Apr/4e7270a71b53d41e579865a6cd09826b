At least two people were stabbed, another was shot — and bullets flew in Hell’s Kitchen — in the city overnight, cops said. The violence began around 6:50 p.m. Monday, when a male attacker repeatedly stabbed a 60-year-old man in the torso and slashed him in the face during a squabble on Second Avenue near East 48th Street in Midtown, Manhattan, authorities said. Witnesses told police that the victim was sitting on the sidewalk and threw a bottle on the ground in front of the suspect, sparking the dispute, according to police sources. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. The suspect, who was with a woman at the time, fled north on Second Avenue. Another man, 38, was stabbed during a large fight at Atlantic Avenue and 88th Street in the Woodhaven section of Queens around 4:15 a.m. Tuesday, authorities said. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in stable condition, cops said. In the Mott Haven section of The Bronx, a teen was shot on East 143rd Street near Willis Avenue around 1:20 a.m. Tuesday, police added. Two males walked up to the 18-year-old victim as he stood at the corner, and one of them opened fire with a handgun, cops said. He was taken to Lincoln Medical Center, where he is listed in stable condition. About a half-hour later, someone opened fire from a burgundy SUV at West 45th Street and Eighth Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen in Manhattan, but no one was hurt, police said. The shooter discharged several rounds, cops said. It is unclear if there was any property damage. Police did not immediately know whether the shooter was targeting someone. No arrests have been made in any of the incidents.
