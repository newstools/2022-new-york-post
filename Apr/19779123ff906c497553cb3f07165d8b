The widow of Bob Dylan’s collaborator Tuesday lost her bid to revive her lawsuit against the “Money Blues” singer for a cut of his song-catalogue sale. Claudia Levy failed in her bid to overturn a previous Manhattan ruling that tossed her lawsuit seeking a portion of the money Dylan  made when he off-loaded his catalogue to Universal Music Group in 2020. Levy had argued that her late husband Jacques Levy’s estate was entitled to 35 percent of the profits Dylan made when he sold the seven songs her husband collaborated on him with for the legend’s 1976 album “Desire.” But an appeals court Thursday found that Jacques Levy’s contract with Dylan was “unambiguous, and does not entitle plaintiffs to proceeds from the sale of the copyrights of the compositions cowritten with Dylan.” Levy – who died in 2004 – co-wrote the majority of the nine songs on the album with the “Blowin’ in the Wind” singer, for which he had received 35 percent royalties totaling roughly $1 million. His widow brought her the $7.25 million lawsuit against Dylan last year. “Today’s decision puts the nail in the coffin of this opportunistic lawsuit,” Dylan’s lawyer, Orin Snyder, said in a statement. “We are pleased the court has again rejected this sad attempt to profit off of Bob’s recent catalog sale.” Claudia’s lawyer did not return a request for comment.
