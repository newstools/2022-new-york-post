Gobble, Gobble. No, it’s not Turkey Day, it’s Mother’s Day, and meal kit company Gobble has a treat in store for you. If your mom, grandma, wife or any mother-figure in your life is a big brunch lover, this is the perfect Mother’s Day treat for the whole family to enjoy. For both new and returning subscribers, Gobble is offering a complete Mother’s Day Brunch, with four servings of goodness starting at $11.99 per serving. Factor in the priceless time you and your kids or other family members spend cooking for your matriarch, Gobble will help make this a Mother’s Day present she won’t forget any time soon. Speaking of soon, those that order the kit before April 29 will get a guaranteed delivery before the big holiday on May 8, arriving at your door between May 3 and 5 to be popped in the fridge until go-time. Those who act fast can also take advantage of our New York Post exclusive Spring Shopping Event deal, offering six servings for $36 total, shipping included. Use code “nyspringsale” or shop via our links to get in on the action before the holiday and the promotion are up. Getting into the goodness, the special kit contains four servings of cinnamon brown sugar French toast, crispy bacon and a refreshing fruit cobbler, sure to fill you up, body and soul. You can also view the special bundle on the menu page, toggling to the week of May 2, and listed under “Specialty Kits for Four.” If Mother’s Day isn’t your thing, or you have been meaning to try the meal kit company and needed a push, this is it. Aside from the special brunch offerings, there is a full menu to explore, spanning filling traditional dinners, Lean & Clean options, breakfast choices, soups, sides, salads and even desserts. With the option to swap your proteins, there are options for meat-eaters and vegetarians alike on the rotating menu, making it easy to get food on the table for everyone to gobble down. We actually had the privilege to try the Gobble meal kit for ourselves, testing a stunning steak meal and a fresh fish dish you can almost smell and taste here. Not only was the food delicious, but the generous portion sizes and easy-to-follow and store recipe cards made this meal kit company stand out. Also, the chocolate chip cookie dough was an added perk that would be a shame to leave out of your cart. Now is the time to try Gobble for yourself! Even with the four-serving Mother’s Day Brunch added to cart, there are still two more portions to choose from on the full menu to get to six servings, now bundled for just $36 total using code “nyspringsale” at checkout or by using our links.
