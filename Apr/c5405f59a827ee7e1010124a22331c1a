Save your dollar bills. These seniors are shaking their moneymakers for free. A video showing a professional pole dancer — and her enthusiastic elder audience — performing at a senior center has gone viral with nearly 14 million views on TikTok since last week. Embla Bergli, a dancer and aerial artist from Olso, Norway, was hired for a seasonal shindig that called for “spectacular entertainment,” she told The Post, and found herself in a recreation room full of retirees recently. Bergli, 27, was booked to display her pole skills for members of a local mental health advocacy group, but it wasn’t long before her audience became the true stars of the show and had their turn — quite literally — at the pole. “I was very excited to see how they would react,” the fit, blonde Bergli told The Post. “They all loved it, and it was so fun to watch them try the pole themselves. “My show lasted for maybe 10 minutes, but I was there for over an hour after, talking with them and showing them some tricks — and writing autographs!” she added. “Super cute.” “You know it’s been a successful night when you end up writing autographs,” Bergli even concluded her TikTok montage, which showed her signing slips of paper for her newfound fans. Several viewers called the footage “wholesome” in the comments, while one fan joked, “If this ain’t my nursing home when I’m older I don’t want it .” Bergli additionally earned a nod from fellow hot blonde celebrity Jenny McCarthy: “Epic,” she called the video. Bergli, who recently decided to “focus 100%” on pole and aerial work after quitting her job as a tech economist, told The Post she would “love to” return to the senior center. “I think a lot of seniors would be happy to see different kinds of performers at centers and homes, and it’s also great for performers to explore new types of arenas to show off their art,” she said.
