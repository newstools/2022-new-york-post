A crew of muggers repeatedly slugged a man and stole his wallet after he withdrew money from an East Harlem bank earlier this week, cops said. The victim, a 67-year-old, was walking on Third Avenue near East 117th Street after taking out cash from the bank at about 10:45 p.m.  Thursday. The four strangers ran up to him from behind and started punching him, police said Thursday night. One of the muggers also struck him in the head with a “blunt object,” according to police. The crew grabbed the victim’s wallet — holding about $800, identification documents and a debit card — before running off, heading north on Third Avenue, cops said. The victim was taken to Metropolitan Hospital Center in stable condition. Cops released a surveillance image of three of the suspects, who were each seen wearing winter coats with their hoods pulled up.
