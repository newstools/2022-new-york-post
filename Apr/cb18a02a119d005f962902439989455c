Crypto exchange Binance has pulled a custom emoji it sponsored on Twitter after outraged users pointed out that it resembled a swastika. The emoji — which automatically appeared alongside the hashtags #Binance, #BNB and #BitcoinButton — was released Wednesday, which was Adolf Hitler’s birthday. Twitter users promptly pointed out the shape of the emoji, with one popular tweet saying that “the new Binance emoji is a literal swastika.” Hours after the blowback began, Binance copped to the mistake and said that the logo was “obviously really embarrassing.” “We’re not sure how that emoji got through several layers of review without anyone noticing, but we immediately flagged the issue, pulled it down, and the new emoji design is being rolled out as we speak,” the company wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The new emoji design now resembles a globe with Binance’s logo on it. Cayman Islands-registered Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, clearing more than $17 billion in transactions each day, according to CoinMarketCap data. In May 2021, Bloomberg reported that the US Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service were investigating the company for potential money laundering and tax violations. The current status of the investigation is unclear.
