A 61-year-old man was killed when a blaze erupted in his Queens home early Wednesday, authorities said. The fire broke out in the basement of the two-story residence on Bedell Street near 115th Road in Jamaica around 4:30 a.m., officials said. Colin Cyrus was discovered unconscious and unresponsive – with severe burns – inside the home, police said. He was pronounced dead on scene by EMS. No one else was hurt, according to the FDNY. The blaze, which drew a dozen units with 60 firefighters to the scene, was under control by 5:10 a.m., the FDNY said. The cause was under investigation later in the morning, but there were no immediate signs of criminality.
