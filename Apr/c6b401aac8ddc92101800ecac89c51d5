The Nets carved an opening for Kessler Edwards on their playoff roster, waiving James Johnson on Thursday afternoon. Johnson, who missed Wednesday’s game with an illness, had played 62 games for the Nets this season, averaging 19.2 minutes and 5.5 points on 46.9 percent shooting from the field. Coach Steve Nash said Monday that he expected the team to take the same roster into the postseason, but converting Edwards would be a front office decision. Edwards, a rookie from Pepperdine, has played 46 games this year with Brooklyn, averaging 20.1 minutes and 5.8 points. He’s been on a two-way deal, which would have to be amended for him to be eligible for the postseason. According to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, the plan is to convert Edwards to a standard NBA contract. Nash has praised Edwards’ defense this season, and he’s also shot the ball well, at 35.9 percent from 3-point range. Though Edwards was already on the NBA roster, his two-way status made it impossible for him to be on the playoff roster. Waiving Johnson clears a 15-man permanent roster spot for Edwards in the postseason, while opening up a two-way spot. Center Thon Maker and shooting guards Bryce Brown and Craig Randall could potentially fill that spot, per The Post’s Brian Lewis. Wojnarowski reported on Tuesday that Evan Mobley could return from a sprained ankle for Cleveland as soon as Friday’s game against the Nets. Jarrett Allen, who’s been dealing with a fractured finger, seems less likely to return, as Wojnarowski said he has a “very good chance to be back before the playoffs.” Goran Dragic will be out on Friday because of health and safety protocol, per the Nets. … Seth Curry (ankle) is probable after returning to the lineup Wednesday.
