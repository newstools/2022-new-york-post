Cat got your tongue? In a viral TikTok video posted by Anne, known as @kittanne_pixel on the app, she shows her pet cat Pixel in awe of the filter that makes the user look a little more feline. The clip, which racked up 8.3 million views, was captioned with hashtags such as “#catlover” and “#crazycatlady” and it elicited some laughs, too. “Your [sic] paying the therapy bills,” commented one user. “I thought I knew pure joy, then I watched this video,” said another of the cat’s wide-eyed and spooked reaction. “I’m living for these vids!!” wrote another feline fan. “His face is everything!!” “8.3 million views and counting, 1.7 million ‘likes’, and 34,400 comments — so exciting to have so many people enjoy Pixel’s antics!” Anne told Newsflash of her now-viral clip. “I love reading all the comments, and I try to answer and ‘like’ as many as I can.” Anne, who is from Canada, said that she found her furry friend Pixel, now 3, when he was only 3-months-old from a rescue shelter. As an avid animal lover, Anne previously worked at a veterinary clinic and ran an in-home pet care service. “I love animals sooo much!” she said, adding that she owns three other felines from different shelters. “Candy [is a] gray-and-white tuxedo domestic shorthair, Tippy [is a] three-legged dilute calico domestic medium [hair], [and] Cotton [is a] white with tabby patches domestic shorthair.” Pixel, she said, has larger eyes than other cats, describing them as “kitten-like.” “He has hilarious expressions that make everyone laugh. That is why I wanted to share him with TikTok,” she continued. “He also loves to play fetch, especially when I am asleep in bed!”
