A police van fatally struck a man who is believed to be homeless in Brooklyn Thursday night, cops said. The marked NYPD van was heading west on Eastern Parkway near Schenectady Avenue in Crown Heights just after 8 p.m. — with its lights and sirens on — when it struck the 53-year-old man, who was standing on the center median, cops and police sources said. The victim was believed to be homeless and panhandling when the van slammed into him, cops said. He was rushed to Kings County Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. The van, which is assigned to the 73rd Precinct, was carrying two cops and four prisoners and headed to central booking, according to police sources. None of the occupants were injured. The victim was not immediately identified, pending family notification.
