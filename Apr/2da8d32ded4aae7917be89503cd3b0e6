What a hit! Grammy Award winners Alicia Keys and her producer husband Kasseem “Swizz Beatz” Dean have finally sold their 5-acre New Jersey estate — at a massive loss. The music power couple bought the property from Eddie Murphy in two separate transactions for a $12.1 million sum nearly a decade ago. They first put it on the market for $14.9 million in 2015, but slashed the price to $9.9 million last August. It was still asking that price when it went into contract in February. Now, Gimme can exclusively reveal the closing price: The spread went for just $6 million. “It’s an insane price. I can’t believe it went that low,” said an insider familiar with the deal. Keys, Dean and their two kids — Egypt and Genesis — spend most of their time on the West Coast these days. In 2019, they bought a modern cliffside mansion known as Razor House for $20.8 million in La Jolla, California. The home, crafted by architectural designer Wallace E. Cunningham, is said to be the inspiration for Iron Man Tony Stark’s fictional cliffside property in the MCU. It’s a completely different look from the Colonial-style New Jersey mansion, which they had spent millions renovating — including the addition of a gallery for their massive art collection, which famously includes Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Kaws and Maya Hayuk. The 25,000-square-foot property at 191 Brayton St. comes with six bedrooms, an indoor pool, a two-lane bowling alley, a movie theater, two elevators — and a state-of-the-art recording studio. Keys and Dean had first plunked down $10.42 million on the 32-room mansion in 2013. A year later, they bought an adjacent empty lot from Murphy for $1.7 million at 286 Johnson Ave. The listing broker was Christopher Boel of Christie’s International Real Estate.
