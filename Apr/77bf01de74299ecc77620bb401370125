If you’ve ever wondered if you and your partner will be in it for the long haul, a therapist has revealed the sign that will give you the answer. And it has nothing to do with your chemistry in the bedroom or your family’s approval. A psychotherapist on TikTok, who simply goes by Your Pocket Therapist, revealed that it’s all on how they respond to your need for attention. “An experiment showed that how couples respond to the other’s bid for attention determines if they will stay together,” she began. She explained that a bid is an attempt at connection. Examples of this include telling your partner “look at that pretty tree!” or sighing so they ask whether you’re okay or not. “Couples who responded positively to bids were 80 percent more likely to stay together in a year than those who responded negatively or didn’t respond,” she continued. “This study proved humans think it’s better to be single than be unseen.” Many people took to the comment section to reflect on their own relationships with many saying they’ve noticed this in their partner. One woman wrote: “Been with my partner eight years, every time I say ‘Look! Dog!’ he immediately looks, once resulting in walking into a pole.” Another one commented: “I think him and I are good, I held up a tiny rock and said ‘look how cute!’ and he said, ‘awww so tiny!’ Then he kept it.” But many others noticed that their former partners would never respond to their bids. One woman wrote: “Mine would never look up when I was speaking to him but when he would speak to me I would always respond.” “I speak to my partner and he doesn’t even know I’ve spoken a lot of the time,” a second commented. And a third added: “My ex said in a minute or looked at his phone.” This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
