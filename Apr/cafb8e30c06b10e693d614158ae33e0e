Two teams that opened the USFL season with victories meet Sunday as the New Orleans Breakers battle the Tampa Bay Bandits. Both of these defenses were impressive in their Week 1 wins. New Orleans allowed 17 points, recorded six sacks, and held the Philadelphia Stars to just 4.5 yards per play. Tampa Bay’s defense was even more dominant in its win over the Pittsburgh Maulers. The Bandits allowed a USFL-low three points and gave up just 3.0 yards per play in their 14-point victory. As well as Tampa Bay’s defense played last week, its offense did very little. The Bandits put up 244 total yards and averaged 3.9 yards per play, including just 2.1 yards per rush. New Orleans’ offense performed a little better, but it still struggled to sustain drives. The Breakers scored one offensive touchdown and were held to 11 offensive drives. Nine of New Orleans’ 23 points came from the defense. The total for this game is set at 40.5. That seems high considering both defenses far outplayed their offenses in Week 1. The USFL would love to see fireworks on its Sunday showcase game, but this isn’t the matchup to produce it.  Expect a close, low-scoring affair between two of the USFL’s top defenses. The play: Breakers-Bandits Under 39.5.
