The Cleveland Indians are now the Guardians. Next up, the Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Chiefs, Chicago Blackhawks, Florida State Seminoles and Stitches’ favorite Mexican Indoor Soccer League team, the Chihuahua Savage. I perish the thought. And if a gallon of gas stays below $5, the Guardianapolis 500 is a month away. Cleveland is at Oakland this weekend. Both the Guardians and A’s are expected to be watching the postseason with their families this year. Shane Beiber (1-1, 2.82) has had trouble on the road where six of his seven runs have been allowed. The Athletics’ Cole Irvin (2-1, 3.32) has been dependable, allowing four runs in his last 16 innings. Believe the Biebs, a career 42-19, prevails. Historic pick. For the first time ever: 10 units on the Guardians.  Two quick runs on Yu Darvish had us choking on our chicken dinner but Darvish settled down, and the Padres topped the Pirates 7-3. Another win.
