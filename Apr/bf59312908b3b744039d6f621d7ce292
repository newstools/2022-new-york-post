Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training action on Friday: After Aaron Boone all but assured Albert Abreu’s presence on the Opening Day roster, in part because the right-hander is out of options and can’t be sent to the minors without going through waivers, Abreu threw 1 ²/₃ shutout innings and hasn’t allowed a run in 4 ²/₃ innings this spring. Joey Gallo is picking up where he left off last season. He fanned twice more and has whiffed 11 times in 27 plate appearances this spring. Gallo had an MLB-high 213 strikeouts last season. He’s also just 4-for-24 with a pair of extra-base hits. Miguel Cabrera turns 39 this month, but he was still able to take Chad Green deep to the opposite field. It was the first homer allowed by Green this spring and the first one hit by Cabrera. The slugger has 502 home runs in his career. Luis Severino is scheduled to make his first start since experiencing a sore arm following his last outing last Friday, as the Yankees play host to the Braves at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa at 1:05 p.m.
