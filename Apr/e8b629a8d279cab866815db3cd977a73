Looks are being served! A man has gone viral showing off his mouthwatering hairdos on his Instagram account, @bmrtwins1, which has been displaying an array of funky junk food-themed styles on models. In the first tasty look, a hairstylist used a pack of ramen noodles to make faux blond, wavy locks. In the video showing off the bizarre coiffure, two girls lean in and begin taking bites out of the noodles as a man sprinkles seasoning over the “hair.” “What is happening here?” musician Dupree G.O.D asked. “The Yum cut,” Francia James coined the look. “One of them girls really missed lunch today,” @cantlabelfitness joked. The creative and flavorful looks only got better from there. The most popular hairdo was the wacky Cheetos ‘do which earned 29,600 likes. Bright-orange cheese puffs shoot out of the man’s bald head as the creative genius stands behind him holding a bag of the cheesy snack. The man in the background then proceeds to enjoy some Cheetos as the model shakes his head in approval. “That’s a tasty cut,” James said. “Looking like Chuckie Finster from Rugrats,” Warren commented. “Seagulls gone have some fun soon he step outside,” @FettiMane_Bert teased. “He finna have to hide when I get the munchies,” @quietstormv joked. Continuing the funny videos, a third clip shows circular slices of hot dog glued to the man’s pate as the hairstylist pours a can of Bush’s baked beans on top to complete the dish, er, look. “What’s your favorite struggle meal?” the caption asked viewers. The fourth hairstyle is a little bit sweeter. A curtain of red Twizzlers is stuck to the burly model’s head as he’s spun around to show off the candy wig. In the most recent video, a full Popeyes meal is served atop a new model’s bald head. A spread of fluffy biscuits and crispy fried chicken are stuck to his scalp above a Popeyes sign as he shows off the hairstyle holding the brand’s container. Fans have flooded the comments with hilarious bon mots and can’t wait for the next tasty cut.
