Flipper was fed up. A dolphin turned on his trainer and thrashed her in front of a gasping crowd at the Miami Seaquarium on Saturday, according to a report. Video of the attack shows a trainer suddenly being violently rammed and lifted out of the water before the dolphin relented. “One trainer that was furthest away from the video either kept getting hit by the dolphin or pulled down by the dolphin,” said Shannon Carpenter, who filmed the incident and shared it on social media. “The kids were cheering and thinking this was neat,” he said. “You could tell the adults knew something was wrong.” Once clear of the dolphin, the trainer can be seen frantically swimming for the edge of the pool and hoisting herself out. Another trainer then comes to check on and console her as she kneels in shock. In a statement, park officials said the dolphin — named “Sundance — became spooked after running into the trainer. “A dolphin and trainer accidentally collided in the water on Saturday while performing a routine behavior as part of the Flipper Show,” the park said. “This was an uncomfortable interaction for both of them and the dolphin reacted by breaking away from the routine and striking the trainer.” There were no serious injuries stemming from the incident. But the unnerving episode was just the latest controversy for Miami Seaquarium. The USDA ripped the facility last June, issuing a 17-page report accusing it of a host of animal welfare violations. These included feeding animals rotten fish and neglecting their welfare in general.
