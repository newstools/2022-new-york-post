New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams revealed Friday she has tested positive for the coronavirus and is “generally feeling OK,” amid an uptick in cases across the Big Apple that pushed officials to delay rolling back mask mandates for toddlers. “I am generally feeling OK, which I attribute to being fully vaccinated,” Adams (D-Queens) said in a statement. “It is important to remember that we are still in a pandemic, as deemed by public health professionals,” she added. “While we are thankfully in a different place than at the worst of this pandemic, it is important to continue taking the necessary steps to protect ourselves and each other.” Word of her diagnosis came as city health officials warned that the latest evolution of the coronavirus’s Omicron variant, known as BA2, is even more contagious than the original and fueling the recent rise in case numbers. New York City’s average positivity rate for the last week hit 2.67 percent, up from the monthly average of 2.33 percent. However, those figures remain far below the height of the pandemic.
