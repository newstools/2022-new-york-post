How you see things reflects who you are as a person, right? We spot patterns based on how our minds are trained and that, in turn, reveals things about us. How you see an image can reveal a lot about your personality and here is one that will say a lot about you. Here is an optical illusion that can be seen in two different ways and the aspect of your personality is revealed based on what you spotted first. So, did you see a young girl or an old man first? With this optical illusion, it’s your mental age that is determined by what you see. By mental age, this regards to how you see the world, either through the eyes of a young child or through the lens of someone more mature. If you can see the old man with his head bowed down, lost in contemplation, it means that you are mature in your thoughts. You are well-travelled and have experience the world’s ups and downs. You have grown to see the world for what it is and have had the experiences which have helped you develop as a person. You are calm and humble and have grown as a wise soul. However, if saw the young girl in the illusion, it means that you are a child at heart. You see the world with the curiosity of a child and have not let go of your innocence. It is a rare quality to have as most of us tend to ignore our inner child as we grow up, but you have preserved this side of your personality. Not only this, but you still find joy in the simplest things in life. Take a look for yourself – which image jumps out to you?
