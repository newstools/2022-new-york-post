The “Material Girl” is no virgin to the real estate market, but she’s down on her knees wishing on her lucky star to successfully flip this Los Angeles-area mansion for such a big profit. Madonna, 63, listed her 3-acre Hidden Hills home for $25.9 million just a year after buying it from Canadian R&B star The Weeknd, the Wall Street Journal reported. That’s $6.7 million more than the $19.3 million the pop queen paid for the approximately 12,000-square-foot estate, which she bought from the “Can’t Feel My Face” singer in April 2021. The Weeknd originally attempted to sell the nine-bathroom main home for a similar price in 2021. The Post previously reported that the 32-year-old singer first listed the address last June for $25 million, a pretty penny more than the $18.2 million he shelled out for it in 2017. This time around, however, the house may actually sell at the steep asking price, thanks to the addition of a new gym and dance studio in the property’s barn. Trevor Wright of the Beverly Hills Estates has the listing. The home also features a saltwater pool, a basketball court, a 10-person spa, an indoor-outdoor bar, a formal dining room with a fireplace, a wine cellar, a five-car auto gallery, a home theater and a two-bedroom, two-bathroom guest house with a full kitchen. All seven of the main residence’s bedrooms have ensuite baths. The foyer has a two-story wall of windows while the “stunning compound” is accessed via an “olive-tree lined drive & storybook bridge.” The grounds are located on a “sun-drenched hillside” brimming with redwood trees in the gated Hidden Hills community, which, Wright mentions, is known for its many current and former famous residents.
