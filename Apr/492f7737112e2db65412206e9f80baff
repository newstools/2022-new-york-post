This house ain’t brick, but it’s stacked — and that’s a fact. A six-story, 7,000-square-foot townhouse – tricked out with “a midnight bar” and a “spa level” – has sold for $6.4 million in Harlem, smashing the neighborhood’s sales record for a townhouse. The property at 32 Mount Morris Park West had asked $6.5 million. The Real Deal first reported the deal. Harlem’s previous townhouse record was set by a home at 72 Hamilton Terrace, which sold for $5.1 million in 2018 after being newly restored following a fire that gutted the property. Built in 1888, this new record holder preserves much of its history, including cast iron columns and an original fireplace. The 24-foot-wide, five-bedroom, five-bathroom spread was commissioned by John Dwight, the co-founder of Arm & Hammer, for Civil War Union general Alexander Phoenix Ketchum. Today, the house has an additional 2,000 square feet of outdoor space and rooftop gym/glass solarium. The third floor boasts what the listing calls that “spa-level” bathroom and a walk-in closet with a “midnight bar.” Braden Linard, owner of boutique design firm Brad Linard designs, was the seller, according to public records, and he was represented by Douglas Elliman’s Erin Boisson Aries and Dustin Crouse. Compass agents Anna Hargraves Hall and James Hall represented the buyer. The sale has yet to hit public records, shielding the identity of the buyer – for now. Last year, Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka listed their Harlem brownstone for $7.32 million, The Post reported. “If this house could win an Emmy, it would. There is so much soul and character that it’s hard to pinpoint standout features because there are too many to count,” listing broker Vickey Barron of Compass, who shares the listing with Compass’ Pacey Barron, told The Post. But ultimately the celebrity digs failed to find a buyer.
