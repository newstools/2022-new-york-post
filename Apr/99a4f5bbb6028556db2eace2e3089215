Aaron Rodgers is “very excited” about the Packers signing wide receiver Sammy Watkins Thursday. That same day, Rodgers texted his friend Pat McAfee during his live Sirius XM radio show to share his reaction to the Watkins signing, according to McAfee. The text apparently read: “Talked to Sammy Watkins last night Excited about the signing. Can’t wait to get to work.” McAfee said he asked Rodgers’ permission to share the text on his show because he was surprised the Packers quarterback didn’t “just go radio silent like he does with everything else.” Last month, Rodgers went to McAfee to break the news that he will return to Green Bay for an 18th season. “He’s pumped about Sammy Watkins,” McAfee said. “I’m going to assume, just from what I’ve heard about Sammy Watkins from some of the interviews he’s done. Deep thinker, has a very open mind with chit-chatting about things. Him and Aaron might get along perfectly. This might be exactly what Sammy Watkins needs and wants, and I think Aaron Rodgers feels the exact same way, especially the situation they’re in with Davante [Adams] departing.” The Packers signed Watkins to a one-year, $4 million deal, NFL Network reported. It marked Green Bay’s first addition at receiver since it traded top wideout Davante Adams to Las Vegas — where he signed a five-year, $141.25 million contract. Watkins — the fourth overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft — played in 13 games for the Ravens last season, and recorded just 27 catches for 394 yards and a touchdown. The 29-year-old has caught 348 passes for 5,059 yards and 34 touchdowns over eight NFL seasons spent with the Bill (2014-16), Rams (2017), Chiefs (2018-20) and Ravens (2021).
