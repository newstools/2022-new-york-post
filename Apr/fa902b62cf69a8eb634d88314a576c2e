Sean Payton added a little intrigue to the rumors that linked him and Tom Brady to the Dolphins as part of a coup for the Super Bowl coach and legendary quarterback Payton said he was aware “that there was a request put in where the intermediaries talked, and I’m like the rest of you. I heard that story.” Payton denied having any personal role in the reports that had Brady retiring, joining the Dolphins as a minority owner and then acquiring Payton to be the team’s coach before returning to play quarterback for Miami. Payton and Brady both left the sport this offseason before Brady famously returned to the Buccaneers. Payton is expected to land a significant broadcasting role. “I have no clue about the Tampa Bay/Miami Dolphins/Tom Brady rumor… I’m getting ready for TV,” Payton said before he went on to win the Zurich Classic Celebrity Shootout. The Buccaneers and Dolphins are not saying much on the situation. Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht dismissed the Dolphins scenario Tuesday as just being “chatter.” His Dolphins counterpart, Chris Grier, declined to answer a question on the matter in his pre-draft availability on Wednesday. Payton added that if he were to coach in the coming season, he would have remained with the Saints. “Our focus on Tom Brady has been beating him, not joining him,” said Payton, who has left the door open for a possible coaching return. Ultimately, the Dolphins hired Mike McDaniel as their head coach, following the firing of Brian Flores, who moved on with the Steelers as an assistant. Flores is still pursuing his discrimination lawsuit against the NFL and its 32 teams. The legal situation is what reportedly foiled the Miami-Brady-Payton plan. Brady announced last month that he plans to return to Tampa Bay for a 23rd NFL season to take care of “unfinished business” after a bitter ending to last season. The Bucs lost to the Rams 30-27 in the NFC Divisional Round.
