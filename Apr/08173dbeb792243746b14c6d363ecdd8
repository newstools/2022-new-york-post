Disturbing video shot aboard a JetBlue flight captured passengers clamoring to get off the plane in Newark – shouting that they were scared after several failed attempts to land at JFK Airport during bad weather. “I’m not going back in the air,” one passenger is heard yelling at officials in the cabin. Another man is seen pleading to get off the plane, which the airline said had been scheduled to land at JFK after a flight from Cancun, Mexico, on Thursday. “My kids are panicking,” the man shouts. “We gotta get off this plane. It’s dangerous! “We tried to land four times already … we’re scared to fly, we wanna get off! I don’t want to go to jail but it’s not right,” he said. “I don’t care about JFK — it’s our lives! People are sick back there, people are fainting, people are throwing up! A little respect for human beings!” the man continues as other passengers also chime in about wanting to disembark. JetBlue spokesman Derek Dombrowski told The Post that Flight 1852 diverted to Newark Liberty International Airport “due to weather” over JFK. “Without proper customs processing available for the flight at Newark, the aircraft remained on the ground for 60 minutes and once the weather cleared departed again for JFK where it safely landed,” he said in an email. “We apologize for the inconvenience this weather-related diversion created,” Dombrowski added. The airline reportedly offered passengers $50 in flight credits for the inconvenience.
