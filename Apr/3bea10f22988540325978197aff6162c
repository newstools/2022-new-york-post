A man was fatally stabbed in broad daylight in front of his Bronx apartment building on Sunday afternoon, cops said. Police responded to a 911 call of a man stabbed in front of 1212 College Avenue in Concourse Village at around 2:30 p.m., according to police. Responders found 56-year-old Antonio Iglesias, who lives at the address, with stab wounds to both of his legs. He was transported by EMS to Lincoln Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police believe two men approached Iglesias on a scooter — and one of them got off their ride and stabbed him. It appears the attack was not random and Iglesias had been targeted, cops said. No arrests had been made as of Monday morning.
