Yu knew this was coming. Yu Darvish (1-1, 4.43 ERA), who has haunted us since we took over this “bad beat box,” is back. Yu is a career 80-68, many of those 68 coming at our expense. Darvish will make his fifth start in Pittsburgh. Three of his first four left Padre fans Yu-phoric, allowing a single run over a combined 18 innings. The nine-run fiasco in Frisco is his blemish. The Pirates’ Zach Thompson (0-2, 10.80) has been a little more consistent. Thompson has surrendered 12 runs over 10 innings in three starts. The Padres, winners of three straight, are now 13-7 on the young year and are keeping pace with the Giants and Dodgers. A weekend in the Steel City should, Yu know, help. 10 units on San Diego and Yu.  Dakota Hudson threw a one-hitter over six strong, Paul Goldschmidt had three RBIs, and the Cards decked the D’backs, 8-3. Back-to-back wins. Up +38 dizzydeans.
