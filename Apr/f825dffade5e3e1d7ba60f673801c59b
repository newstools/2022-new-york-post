A Bronx teenager who had been freed without bail for a past gun rap was charged over the weekend with murdering an 18-year-old man in the Bronx last month, police and sources said. Rafael Saavedra, 18, was arrested Saturday and charged with fatally shooting 18-year-old Dellin Scarlett at East 172nd Street and Harrod Avenue in Soundview just before 3 p.m. on March 16, police said. Scarlett suffered gunshot wounds to his shoulder, chest, both arms, lower abdomen and both legs, cops said. He was transported to Jacobi Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Saavedra was also charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon in  Scarlett’s slaying.
