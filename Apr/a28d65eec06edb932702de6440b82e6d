Police in Phoenix were frantically searching Friday for a suspect accused of shooting a police officer at a gas station. Nicholas Cody Cowan, 35, remained on the run early Friday after shooting a female officer Thursday who needed surgery to remove the bullet, department officials said. “Let’s find this guy,” Police Chief Jeri Williams tweeted while citing a $10,000 reward for info leading to Cowan’s arrest. The unnamed veteran officer, who was in stable condition Thursday, is “doing well in the hospital,” Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Andy Williams told The Post Friday. Cowan, who is heavily tattooed, should be considered “armed and dangerous” and was last seen wearing a black hat, black T-shirt and black shorts. Anyone who spots him should not approach and instead call 911 immediately, police said. Cowan fled the shooting scene Thursday in a 2012 blue Toyota Prius, which was later found abandoned by investigators, police said. Williams told the Arizona Republic cops went to the gas station after a woman reported that her boyfriend “committed several criminal acts” and tried to commit suicide. The woman told officers she left her home and went to the gas station to avoid a “confrontation,” adding that Cowan threatened to “shoot it out” with any cops who responded to the scene, Williams said. Cowan then opened fire as one of the cops spoke to the woman, striking the 24-year department veteran, Williams told the newspaper. No other injuries were reported. At least 20 police officers have been killed in shootings in the US this year, according to Gun Violence Archive data. Anyone with information about the suspected cop shooter’s whereabouts should call Phoenix police or (480) 946-6377.
