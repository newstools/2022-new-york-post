Kyle Neptune will have some big, if familiar, shoes to fill at Villanova. Shortly after Wildcats basketball coach Jay Wright announced his surprising retirement on Wednesday, the school named Neptune his successor. The 37-year-old Brooklyn native leaves his post at Fordham after one season, guiding the Rams to a 16-16 finish in 2021. “When looking for a successor, we wanted a candidate who could navigate the changing landscape of collegiate athletics and keep Villanova in a position of strength—now and in the future,” Villanova athletic director Mark Jackson said in a release. “After meeting with several exceptional candidates, we found all those attributes and more in Kyle Neptune. Kyle quickly stood out for his basketball knowledge, recruiting savvy and natural ability to connect with student-athletes and coaches.” Neptune, who played college ball at Lehigh, joined Wright’s staff as a video coordinator in 2008, left to be an assistant at Niagara in 2010, and returned to the Villanova staff in 2013. As a Wildcats assistant, he helped guide the team to Big East regular season titles in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020, and league championships in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019. “We’re excited to turn the reins of this treasure of a program over to @kyleneptune,” Wright wrote on Twitter. “Kyle was a part of our staff for 10 years , helped us win two national titles and returns after a successful season @FordhamMBB. He understands our culture and will keep it strong.” With the news of Neptune’s departure, Fordham announced its coaching search will begin immediately with associate head coach Keith Urgo taking over on an interim basis.
