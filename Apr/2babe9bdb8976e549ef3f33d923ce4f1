Viewership for Sunday’s Grammy Awards was up from last year’s all-time low — by just a hair. The telecast, which aired live with host Trevor Noah, averaged 8.9 million viewers on CBS and its other platforms, including streamer Paramount+. That’s up, barely, from last year’s 8.8 million viewers. Sunday’s Grammycast featured big wins for Olivia Rodrigo, Sonic Silk and Jon Batiste — and an X-rated stunt from Lil Nas X that left little to the imagination, both for those in the audience at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and at home. It was the first time the awards took place in Sin City; the Grammys were originally scheduled to air live in January from LA but shifted venues after a spike in the city’s COVID cases. CBS said it expects viewership to rise slightly to around 9.6 million viewers once out-of-home viewership is factored into the equation. That would be a 3% uptick from last year’s pandemic-curtailed telecast, also hosted by Noah, which aired in March from in and around the Los Angeles Convention Center with no in-person guests.
