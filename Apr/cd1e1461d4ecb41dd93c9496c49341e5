Vanna White shared some devastating news on Monday’s episode of “Wheel of Fortune.” The 65-year-old TV personality broke down in tears when she divulged towards the end of the show that her 16-year-old cat Stella died. “She’s such a big member of our family, and she’s going to be missed so much and love her to death,” White sobbed. Host Pat Sajak, 75, then presented an emotional tribute to her furry friend that featured photos of White and Stella. “I’m so sorry about that,” the game show host lamented. The letter-turner also revealed the sad news on Twitter alongside a clip from the show, writing: “My sweet Stella has gone to kitty heaven. I miss her so much. Here are some special memories of the 16 years we had together.” Fans sent out their condolences to the longtime “Wheel” star. “Awww, I’m so sorry Vanna. It’s hard losing a furry one. I lost mine last August. He was 18. We must remember the good times. Stella was beautiful,” one fan tweeted. “I’m so sorry for your loss of Stella. I just lost my cat last week,” one said. Another scribed, “Vanna I was watching Wheel tonight when you announced your sweet fur baby Stella crossed over Rainbow Bridge I’m so sorry for your loss and I know you’re going to miss her so much my prayers are with you and your family.” Earlier this month, White suffered another sad loss in her family. Her stepfather Herbert White Jr, died on April 1 at the age of 96. She announced the news of her stepfather’s passing on social media last week and shared a heartwarming photo of the two hugging alongside a tribute. “It is with great sadness that I tell you my 96-year-old dad passed away peacefully this morning,” White wrote at the time. She went on, “He lived a full and happy life and will be remembered as one of the kindest and most wonderful human beings of North Myrtle Beach. I love you so much dad. RIP #love #family #greatestdad.”
