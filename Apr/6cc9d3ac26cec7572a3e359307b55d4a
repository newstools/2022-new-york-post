We’ve seen plenty of odd reasons for a delay of action in sports. On Friday, the Mets vs. Nationals game was delayed due to a lights outage. This one was a bit different, though. In a North Dakota high school baseball game between the Grafton Spoilers and Rugby Panthers, the game was delayed due to prairie dogs running onto the field, as video from KXMB-TV shows. The prairie dogs were eventually guided off the field. The Panthers went on to win the game 4-1. It wasn’t quite the black cat during the Mets-Cubs game in 1969, or the black cat interrupting Giants-Cowboys in 2019, but add this to the list of animal-related sports oddities.
