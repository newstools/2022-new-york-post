He nearly threw on a cowl and joined the “Justice League.” “Dune” actor Josh Brolin is opening up about nearly getting cast as Batman — over director Zack Snyder’s ultimate choice, now-newly-engaged Ben Affleck — in his versions of the superhero franchise. “It would have been the older, the more raspy, for lack of a better word,” Brolin said on MTV’s “Happy Sad Confused” podcast recently, describing how his take would have differed from Affleck’s portrayal in 2016’s “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” and 2017’s “Justice League.” He also said that the idea was “interesting” to him and claimed that the choice to instead cast Affleck, 49, wasn’t his decision, but Snyder’s. “Honestly, that would have been a fun deal,” Brolin, 54, added. “And maybe I’ll do it when I’m 80.” Affleck is set to appear again as Batman in the upcoming production of “The Flash,” starring beleaguered actor Ezra Miller. Brolin also weighed in on filmmaker Joel Schumacher’s “Batman & Robin,” an oddly sexual — and particularly derided — 1997 version of the Caped Crusader, played by George Clooney, 60, alongside Chris O’Donnell, 51, as Robin/Dick Grayson. “By the way, who I didn’t think was bad — I talked to Clooney, who still is joking about it and it wasn’t his fault,” Brolin said. “He loves a good nipple joke and that was all [director] Joel [Schumacher]. He didn’t do anything wrong.” Most recently, a moodier, eyeliner-wearing Dark Knight — played by Robert Pattinson, 35 — has soared into ever-expanding Gotham City and to box-office heights in “The Batman,” which will stream on HBO Max starting on Monday, April 18.
