Raiders quarterback Derek Carr is laughing over a report that claims the Packers are in trade talks with Las Vegas about tight end Darren Waller. “Lol no chance,” Carr tweeted Monday, in response to a fan who shared the story from Packers reporter Aaron Nagler, writing, “@derekcarrqb don’t let it happen.” Waller, 29, has two years left on his deal with no guaranteed money. He has yet to restructure his contract or sign an extension. Waller has become one of Carr’s favorite targets across three seasons together with the Raiders. He caught 55 passes for 665 yards and two touchdowns in the 2021-22 season, in which he missed five games due to injuries and a positive COVID-19 test. Before that, Waller had back-to-back 1,000-plus yard seasons. The Packers could use a dynamic playmaker, such as Waller, after they traded the All-Pro wideout Davante Adams to the Raiders last month. Following the trade, a separate report by The Athletic said Green Bay initially wanted “an undisclosed player” from the Raiders and a first-round pick in exchange for Adams. Instead, they got a first- and second-round pick back from Las Vegas for Adams. Adams signed a five-year, $141.25 million deal with Las Vegas to reunite with Carr, his former Fresno State quarterback, for the first time since they entered the NFL together in 2014. The Raiders recently signed Carr to a three-year, $121.5 million extension as Las Vegas prepares to contend in a stacked AFC West that includes the Chiefs, Chargers, and Broncos, which acquired quarterback Russell Wilson last month from the Seahawks.
