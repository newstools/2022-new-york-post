Rudy Giuliani is expected next month to meet with the Congressional panel investigating the riot at the Capitol, CNN reported Wednesday. Giuliani, 77, the former personal attorney for ex-President Donald Trump, was subpoenaed by the House select committee in January and had been negotiating with lawmakers about the required level of his compliance under attorney-client privilege, the network said. Trump had tasked the former New York City mayor with leading dozens of lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results. Giuliani “actively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of the former President and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results,” the House committee subpoena alleged. The Republican had displayed a willingness to testify about his claims of election fraud, but did not intend to waive executive or attorney-client privilege, CNN said. The mostly Democratic committee had said it expected Giuliani to “cooperate fully,” and it was reportedly unclear if it would honor his privilege exceptions. Hundreds of witnesses had already testified before the panel, including more than a dozen members of Trump’s inner circle, officials said.
