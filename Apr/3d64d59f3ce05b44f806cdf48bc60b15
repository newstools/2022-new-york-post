The expression is now “mom-like” reflexes. Harrowing footage shows the moment a quick-acting woman saved a child from getting crushed by a truck during an accident in Vietnam. The video originally surfaced in 2019, but Twitter users, including UK cricketer Jofra Archer, recently shared it to Twitter, where it boasts 5.2 million views. The footage, which Jofra captioned “Mother of the year,” shows three people riding a motor scooter down a road in Goi, Nam Dinh, when they suddenly get clipped by a car. The impact sends the cycle hurtling sideways, whereupon the mother and child topple off and veer into the path of an oncoming truck. In a split-second decision, the mother yanks the child out of the way, preventing the tot from being squashed under the crush of stampeding wheels. The clip took Twitter’s collective breath away. “My eye couldn’t believe it how mother’s reflections was quick in microseconds to save the child and put herself in danger of getting killed,” praised one commenter. “The speed at which she fell and going under and controlled in a nano second to move away while Also grabbing the kid. Mind blowing,” wrote another. One incensed viewer fumed: “That car driver have to be punished for that act. However, some detractors blamed the family for piling on the same motorcycle, with one scoffing, “Mother of the year would not have been on that death trap in the first place.” However, as Jofra pointed out in a subsequent tweet, not “everyone is fortunate enough to have a car.” In a similar vehicular near-miss in October, a child in China was run over by a combine harvester — and lived to tell the tale.
