A man who jumped into the East River on Friday showed what he thought about being rescued, according to a Post photo. The man stuck his tongue out for the camera — after the NYPD’s Marine Unit helped him out of the drink with a ladder at FDR Drive and East 34th Street in Lower Manhattan around 1:30 p.m. The man was taken to Bellevue Hospital by EMS for treatment, according to first responders at the scene.
