Eya Guezguez, a 17-year-old Tunisian Olympian, was killed in a boating accident over the weekend. Olympic sailors Eya and her twin sister, Sarra, were training with their national team on Sunday when the boat they were in capsized in high winds. Sarra was rescued, but Eya did not survive. “I am shocked by the news of sailor Eya Guezguez’s death. She was an inspiring talent and role model for her athletes’ generation,” International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach in a statement on the IOC’s website. “Eya Guezguez’s participation at Tokyo 2020 alongside her twin sister Sarra will continue to motivate girls everywhere. Our thoughts are with her family, friends and the Olympic community in Tunisia.” The sisters finished 21st in the 49er FX class at last year’s Tokyo Games and at age 16, were the youngest Olympians to represent the North African country. They were also the youngest sailors to compete in Tokyo. The accident took place off the coast of the country’s capital, Tunis, according to Tunisian Olympic Committee president Mehrez Boussayan. Eya was reportedly training for upcoming international and regional competitions. The BBC also reported that Boussayan said the girls’ coach, who was traveling alongside in a speedboat, helped untangle Sarra from the boat’s rigging after it had capsized. He then located her sister in the water and tried to revive her using CPR but was unsuccessful. She was pronounced dead by drowning at a local hospital, per the report. The Tunisian Olympic Committee released a statement, saying: “May God have mercy on the deceased, grant her eternal rest in paradise, and grant her family and relatives and the entire sports family a beautiful patience and solace.” An investigation into the incident is under way, according to a report. — With Post wires
