Have you got your ticket? Tonight’s eye-watering multi-million dollar jackpot may just change your life forever. The estimated total for the Powerball jackpot soared after no one picked the lucky numbers in Wednesday’s drawing. The jackpot now sits at an estimated $400 million with a cash option of $240.8 million, according to the Powerball website. Lottery hopefuls have come up empty since two California and Wisconsin residents claimed the $632.6 million jackpot in January. January’s drawing marked the first time someone hit the Powerball jackpot since Oct. 4. A single ticket in California took home $699 million in the historic drawing — the seventh-largest in US lottery history and fifth-biggest Powerball win, officials said.
