Here’s how to get sloshed while making a splash. This new construction mansion comes with a swim-up bar, which allows revelers to float directly from the heated infinity pool to a drinking station. “In the Florida Keys, nothing has ever been built, in my opinion, like this home,” listing agent Alex Pinero of Pine River Realty told The Post of the home’s reportedly record-breaking recent sale of $8.8 million. According to Pinero, that price was the “biggest sale ever in a Lower Matecumbe [Key] canal-front home” he said, emphasizing that many oceanfront homes have sold for more. The six-bedroom, over 6,900-square-foot property was initially listed for even higher: When it hit the market last month, it was asking $9.25 million, Mansion Global reported. In addition to its swim-up bar (the pool also has a waterfall), the home also offers over 120-feet of water frontage, a two-car garage with driveway, elevator, six-and-a-half baths, a covered patio and dining area and outdoor kitchen — in all there is 3,000-square-feet of outdoor space. The primary bedroom has “his and hers showers,” a walk-in closet and balcony according to the listing, which notes there is also “endless storage.” The main entrance to the house is bordered by palm trees. The 0.39-acre development was completed late last year and has “top of the line finishes,” said Pinero. While reportedly record-breaking for the area, the distinctly modern home’s sales price quickly pales in comparison to other recent Florida sales and listings. Last month, the former Palm Beach estate of Princess Alia bint Al Hussein — the 66-year-old daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan — sold for $45.4 million. And in Sunny Isles, two brokers recently attempted to flip a triplex penthouse for $33.91 million.
