Shocking surf cam footage captured the terrifying moment a toddler was attacked by a coyote on the shore of a Southern California beach as two oblivious adults stood just feet away Thursday. The prairie wolf pounced on the little girl’s face and immediately knocked her to the ground as she played near the ocean at Huntington Beach, according to video obtained by KMPH. The dangerous wild dog then rolled her to and fro — at one point leaping off the tot before lunging back on her in a mounting position — as two adults and a kid standing next to her watched the waves crash, the startling footage showed. After about 14 excruciating seconds a woman turned her head, noticed the ambush and finally  scared the coyote away. The child was rushed to the hospital where she was expected to recover from serious injuries, the outlet reported. Cops later shot two coyotes dead on the Orange County beach, but the canine that charged at the young girl was not among them, according to KABC-TV.
