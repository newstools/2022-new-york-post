A mom-of-one who became pregnant at 13 years old and gave birth at 14 shared that people often think her daughter is her sister as they look so similar. In a sweet video uploaded to TikTok, the mum and daughter duo danced together. They explained that now that daughter Mia has grown up a bit, she looks so much like her mom Sophie McGlynn. In the short clip, Sophie said: “Got pregnant at 13 and gave birth at 14. “Daughter grows up and looks and acts like a mini me. Everyone thinks we’re sisters.” Fellow TikTokers were blown away by the unusual parent-daughter combo. One person said: “I thought you were friends.” Another said: “You look like sisters or best friends!! Beautiful.” While a third said: “Na stop. I thought you were friends and were doing this trend. Thought you were about 19 now.” While another said: “There’s no way that’s your daughter. How old is she now?” To which the young mother replied: “14 in July.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
