Daniil Medvedev will miss the next 1-2 months after undergoing a procedure to fix a hernia problem, the tennis star announced on Saturday. That puts participation in next month’s French Open for the world No. 2 in danger. Medvedev, who won last year’s U.S. Open and reached the final of this year’s Australian Open in January before falling to Rafael Nadal, will likely miss this month’s Monte Carlo Masters as well as clay court season events in Madrid and Rome in the run-up to the year’s second major. “The last months I have been playing with a small hernia,” Medvedev said on Twitter. “Together with my team I have decided to have a small procedure done to fix the problem. I will likely be out for the next 1-2 months and will work hard to be back on court soon. Thanks for all the support.” He then posted a picture showing him recovering as he watched Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Watford in the Premiere League. Earlier in the week, Medvedev’s attempt to reclaim the top spot in the world rankings came up short when he was beaten by Hubert Hurkacz, 7-6 (7), 6-3, in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open.
