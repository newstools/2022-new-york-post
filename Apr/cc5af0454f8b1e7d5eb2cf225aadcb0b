Actress Estelle Harris, who voiced Mrs. Potato Head in “Toy Story” and played George Costanza’s judgmental mother on “Seinfeld,” died Saturday of natural causes, her family said. She was 93. Her son, Glen Harris, confirmed her death to Deadline. “It is with the greatest remorse and sadness to announce that Estelle Harris has passed on this evening at 6:25pm,” Glen Harris told the site. “Her kindness, passion, sensitivity, humor, empathy and love were practivally unrivaled, and she will be terribly missed by all those who knew her.” Harris was known for her distinct high-pitched voice, but she is perhaps best remembered as Estelle Costanza on the NBC sitcom “Seinfeld.” In a 2014 Mother’s Day interview with The Post, she imagined how her TV counterpart and her son may have marked the holiday. “If George Costanza ever made me a meal for Mother’s Day, it would be a fiasco,” she said at the time. “Everythign would turn out awful. He would probably do it the wrong way – he’d be breaking the dishes, inviting the wrong people, ruining everything.” Harris herself didn’t have the best view of the holiday, she revealed. “I don’t like any of these holidays,” the famous TV mom said. “I feel like they’re brought out strictly to earn money. I like every day to mean something, and not just celebrate it because it has a name.” Harris was born April 4, 1928 in Manhattan to Polish-Jewish immigrants, according to her imdb profile. The family later moved to Tarentum, Pa., where she graduated high school, the profile stated. She began her acting career in dinner theater before ascending to film and TV in supporting roles beginning in the mid 1980s. Her lengthy resume includes appearances on the show “Nigh Court,” “Married…With Children” and “Star Trek: Voyager. Harris is survived by three children, three grandsons and a great-grandson, Deadline said.
