The cat came back! A one-eyed cat was reunited with its owner on Friday, five years after it went missing, according to reports. The feline was found in a shipping container on a Scottish offshore oil rig, where it accidentally ended up after living as a stray for years in Peterhead on the mainland, according to the Guardian. The cat — who a microchip revealed to be named Dexter — had been living in and around the Peterhead prison, where guards who fed him called him “One-eyed Joe.” “We are so glad that he was well looked after for the time he was missing,” said Scottish animal control officer Aimee Findlay. “But we’re even more delighted to be able to reunite him with his original owner, thanks to his microchip being up to date.” Prison staff reportedly “fuss over” the cat, who is “much-loved” at the facility, the National reported.
