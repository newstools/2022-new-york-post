In the clip, a woman can be seen sprawled across four seats with her electrical items, backpack and pillow. TikTok user Ameya Okamoto captioned the clip: “Can we talk about how this woman is taking up enough space for like 10 people at my gate… “After this she sat up and stared at me while I looked for a place to sit and now I am on the floor.” One social media user commented: “How are people comfortable enough to sprawl out like it’s their personal living room?” Another said: “That is what you call a sense of entitlement and not thinking of others.” However, other followers criticized the social media user for not just asking the other passenger to move. One put: “There’s no one look for seating! There’s even bags on seats from other people. Why cause drama?” Another commented: “Why are people so afraid of confrontation that they would rather inconvenience themselves and then complain on the internet later.” Meanwhile, a Ryanair passenger was left stunned after a woman’s rude behavior during a flight. A flight attendant recently revealed the essential etiquette rules that all passengers should follow during a flight.
