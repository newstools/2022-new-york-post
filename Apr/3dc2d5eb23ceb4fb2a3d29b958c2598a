A Georgia man killed his grandmother by packing her in a freezer and breaking her bones — then told investigators how much she loved him, local police said. Robert Keith Tincher III allegedly lived with the frozen corpse of 82-year-old Doris Cumming for months before Floyd County cops made the grisly discovery at their Armuchee home late Thursday. Police believe that the granny hurt herself after falling in December, but rather than seeking medical attention, Tincher allegedly dragged her through the home they shared. He “heard and saw numerous bones break” when he did so — and then wrapped her in plastic bags and stuffed her into the freezer alive, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. “From what we determined, at the time, he believed she was still breathing and had some movement at the time she was going into the freezer,” Floyd County Investigator Brittany Werner told the outlet. The charges say Tincher “acknowledged her back broke going into the freezer.” There was “no altercation or provocation” leading up to the acts, according to the charges. Tincher continued living in the home with the body inside the freezer for months, but moved it to a storage unit in March, fearing Cumming’s body might be found. Werner said Tincher told cops he didn’t call 911 because he was wanted for arrest because of terroristic threats made in 2018 against his wife. In a bizarre twist, Tincher also told investigators how much he loved his grandmother. “He said she was the only family member that gave him the courtesy and love and attention he needed,” said Werner. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is performing an autopsy to determine Cumming’s cause of death and when exactly it happened. With Post wires
