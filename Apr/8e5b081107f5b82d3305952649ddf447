The older brother of a 2013 Boston Marathon bombing victim pumped his fist in an emotional display of triumph Monday after completing the race to pay homage to his fallen sibling. Henry Richard was just 10-years-old in 2013 when two terrorists detonated bombs at the finish line of the Boston race, killing his brother, Martin Richard. His younger sister, Jane, lost a leg in the terror attack. The now-20-year old Richard embraced Jane and his parents after completing the grueling 26.2 mile race Monday after a final push down Boylston Street. “So many people were out there for me. All my friends, my family,” he said. “Motivation was the least of my worries. There was so many people there to support me. It was wonderful and I couldn’t believe it.” Richard wrote the names of his siblings on his arms and shoulders and paused briefly at a memorial in their honor along the race route. Martin Richard was one of three people who died during the terror attack that turned the annual competition into chaos. Bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with authorities days aftre the attack while his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had his death sentence reinstated by a federal court last month. Currently enrolled at Pace University in New York, Henry Richard said this was his first completion of a full marathon — and dedicated the performance to his brother. “I’m just so glad I could finally be here,” he said. “So much emotion. I know Martin would have been doing it with me… I did it for both of us.” He wore a yellow jersey emblazoned with his fallen sibling’s initials during the race.
