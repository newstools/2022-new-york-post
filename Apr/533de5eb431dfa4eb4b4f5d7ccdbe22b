Like all the times that Mets players have been hit by pitches through the first three weeks of the season, this news didn’t sit well with Buck Showalter either. The Mets’ manager was stunned that Cardinals first-base coach Stubby Clapp wasn’t suspended for his role in the teams’ skirmish on Wednesday in St. Louis. He asked reporters what discipline the Cardinals received, and expected Clapp to have been given a suspension of some kind, which he did not. “Nothing? Really?” an exasperated Showalter said Friday before the Mets opened a three-game series with the Phillies at Citi Field. “Okey dokey.” Clapp tackled Pete Alonso to the ground in the middle of the melee after both benches cleared following an up-and-in fastball from Mets reliever Yoan Lopez to Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado. The pitch was believed to be in retaliation for J.D. Davis getting plunked on the foot/ankle area in the previous inning. Arenado and Cardinals pitcher Genesis Cabrera each received suspensions. Arenado was given two games and Cabrera one. The Mets have been hit a league-high 19 times in 20 games to begin the season. Earlier in the day, the Mets met with MLB representatives to discuss the rash of pitches that have hit their players this year. Former pitcher Dan Otero came along with MLB executive vice president of baseball operations Morgan Sword to talk about the issue. “Lot of good give and take,” Showalter said.
