Four teens pummeled and robbed a food delivery worker in an Upper Manhattan lobby, video released early Friday shows. The 22-year-old delivery man walked into the lobby of the building on Dongan Place near Broadway in Inwood around 7:30 p.m. April 14, cops said. There, the crew cornered him against a wall and repeatedly punched and kicked him – before one of them grabbed $300 from his pockets, according to the footage and police. One of the suspects is shown holding a metal cane, which he points at the victim before fleeing. Another suspect can be seen pointing a handgun at the victim as he made his way toward the door. The victim refused medical attention for minor injuries. Police believe all of the suspects – who remain at large – are teenagers with slim builds. One was last seen wearing black glasses, a black baseball cap, a white T-shirt, an orange long sleeve shirt, a black balaclava, and dark-colored jeans with black and orange sneakers. Another was last seen wearing a gray and white Nike hooded jacket, gray sweatpants, a white surgical mask and multi-colored sneakers. The third suspect wore a black hooded sweat jacket, black sweatpants, a black balaclava and dark-colored sneakers. Cops say the fourth alleged mugger wore a gray Nike hooded sweat jacket, gray Nike sweatpants, a black surgical mask and multi-colored sneakers.
