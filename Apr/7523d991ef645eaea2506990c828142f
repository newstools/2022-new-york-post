A thrillseeker gets a massive high — on a “ladder to heaven” around 2,300 feet up. Construction engineer Marc Offenbacher, 29, scaled the 140 ft. stairway at the Donnerkogel mountain in Austria. He was snapped by pal Seb Lehrke. Seb said: “It’s a really hard climb. “I wouldn’t recommend you do it unless you’re an experienced climber. “Make sure you’re not scared of heights. “It’s a long way down and everything just looks so small. “But it’s incredible to capture. “The best time to go is in the summer, as it’s so beautiful!” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
