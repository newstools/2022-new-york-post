The Biden administration has compiled a 500-page report on the investigation into Border Patrol agents accused of “whipping” Haitian migrants last year and could release it any day now, the top union official told The Post late Thursday. The report is the outcome of the administrative investigation into the agents’ actions conducted by Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Personal Responsibility (ORP). The agents have been cleared of criminal wrongdoing and won’t face charges, but could still lose their jobs if they are found to have broken agency policies. “No one knows what’s in the report,” National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd said. “I don’t know what’s in it. As of yesterday afternoon, the chief of the Border Patrol didn’t know what’s in it.” Despite not knowing the content of the report, Judd said he was concerned by its length. “I’ve never seen a 500-page report where no one did anything wrong,” he said. Immigration activists and Democratic politicians accused the mounted agents of using split reins to “whip” Haitian migrants as they attempted to cross into the US near Del Rio, Texas this past September. Judd and the National Border Patrol Council have always insisted the agents did nothing wrong and were merely following orders from multiple supervisors to stop the migrants from crossing into the United States illegally. As photos of the incident went viral and caused outrage, some witnesses defended the agents’ actions and said they were appropriate. “I didn’t ever see them whip anybody, with the thing,” photographer Paul Ratije told El Paso TV station KTSM. “He was swinging it. But I didn’t see him actually take — whip someone with it. That’s something that can be misconstrued when you’re looking at the picture.” The agents remain on desk duty and hope to be cleared soon, Judd said.
