A distraught 11-year-old girl frantically called 911 as her mother was being murdered by her stepdad, according to Indiana authorities. Suspect Mac Lewis blasted Elizabeth Bennett Lewis in front of her daughter and the child’s 10-year-old friend at the family’s Sellersburg home Friday, according to the Clarks County Sheriff’s Office. The two kids were “in close proximity” when Lewis was shooting the gun, authorities said. “Multiple gunshots were found throughout several rooms and areas in the residence,” according to a news release from the sheriff’s office. “The initial 911 caller of this incident was Ms. Lewis’s child; she had called while Mac Lewis was still actively firing his gun throughout thehouse and ultimately shooting and killing her mother.” When sheriff’s deputies arrived at the scene, they found Bennett Lewis, who worked as a nurse, dead with multiple gunshot wounds, police said. Lewis had fled the home by the time authorities arrived but was later arrested by the Sellersburg police after he was pulled over on a state road. Mac Lewis is not the father of the 11-year-old girl, sheriff’s officials said. He is charged with murder, attempted murder and criminal recklessness with a firearm. Larry Wilder, a rep for the family of Bennett Lewis, told The Post, “The Bennett family has asked that they be given a moment alone to grieve the loss of Lizzie to this senseless act of violence. “They ask that everyone take a moment to recall her as an amazing mother, a devoted sister and a beloved daughter. “Lizzie gave her short life to caring and helping others,” the spokesman said. “Her choice of becoming a nurse was just an extension of her desire to make the world a better place for everyone. She will be missed by her two children, her family and everyone that knew and loved her.”
