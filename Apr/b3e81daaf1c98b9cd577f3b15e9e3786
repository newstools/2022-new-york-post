A man went on an apparent drug-fueled rampage on the Upper East Side on Monday morning, randomly attacking four people, cops said. The 32-year-old suspect began his violent spree just after 8 a.m., when he punched a man at East 96th Street and Second Avenue without provocation, authorities said. The assailant then moved three blocks north to East 99th Street and Second Avenue, where he hit a man over the head with a bottle, shattering it, police said. The suspect then used the bottle fragments to cut a woman at the same intersection, cops said. His spree ended around 8:30 a.m. on East 92nd Street near York Avenue after he allegedly assaulted another man. Cops did not provide details on that attack. The unidentified suspect was taken into custody at the scene of the fourth assault and brought to Metropolitan Hospital, apparently because of his intoxication, cops said. Charges were still pending against him. All of the male victims were also taken to Metropolitan Hospital and the female to Harlem Hospital. The victims were all reported to be in stable condition, police said.
