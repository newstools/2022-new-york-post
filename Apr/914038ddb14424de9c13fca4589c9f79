The Sacramento Kings and Houston Rockets game was interrupted midway through the third quarter by a streaker before being taken down to the floor and carried out by security. “That was pretty funny,” Kings player Damian Jones said. “It looked like it hurt, to be honest, being tackled by them dudes.” The streaker rushed the Toyota Center court, stripped down to his underwear and danced midcourt for a few seconds. Footage on social media showed the streaker have a brief moment of glory as two security guards spoiled the in-game entertainment. The Rockets and Kings were playing each other for the second time in three days following Sacramento’s 121-118 win on Wednesday. “I thought everybody contributed, and when we needed a stop or a basket, different guys did it for us,” Kings coach Alvin Gentry said. “We had guys stepping up, and I think that’s the main thing. It was a really good team win.” For Sacramento, Damian Jones had 17 points, 17 rebounds and six blocks, Donte DiVincenzo had 19, and Chimezie Metu had 18. Barnes made 10 of 16 from the field, including 4 of 6 from 3-point range. “We just want to play good basketball, finish these games out and see where it goes,” Jones said. “We all played our part and fought to the end.” Houston rookie Jalen Green scored a career-high 33 points and had six 3-pointers. He was coming off a 32-point night on Wednesday and topped 20 points for a fifth straight game.
