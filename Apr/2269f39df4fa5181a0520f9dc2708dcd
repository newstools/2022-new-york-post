ORLANDO, Fla. — RJ Barrett, the one-time Duke star, watched the Final Four on Saturday from his hotel room and said he mostly noticed the walk-off after the game. In particular, Barrett noticed Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski’s stoic demeanor in congratulating UNC coach Hubert Davis and the rest of the Tar Heels after his final game, losing in the national semifinals in a 81-77 heartbreaker in New Orleans. “Man, that game was up, down and crazy,’’ Barrett said. “Tough for them to lose. I admire the way Coach K walked off the court. He always says ‘strong faces.’ He walked off like a champion. He’s the greatest ever to do it. It was his last time on the court and I’m just thankful I was able to be a part of that Duke history.’’ In his lone season at Duke in 2018-19, Barrett, Zion Williamson and Cam Reddish were ousted in the Elite Eight by Michigan State.
