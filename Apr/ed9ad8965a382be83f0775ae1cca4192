Meet the Big Apple’s biggest baby. Kason Priego was born just 11 months ago, but his massive size fools strangers into thinking he’s at least 3 years old. “People stop me on the street to tell me how cute he is,” mom Alexa Priego, 31, told The Post on Monday. “Then they ask his age and their jaws just drop.” When the Upper West Side momma gave birth to baby Kason in May 2021, he weighed in at a normal 7 pounds 14 ounces. But after two months of breastfeeding, the infant had become extremely “chunky” — using his mom’s word — and he only continued to pack on the pounds. The supersized bub is currently wearing clothing intended for children ages 3 and up. Alexa explained that she overproduces milk, which is the reason behind baby Kason’s huge size. The hospital administrator is also a mom to Owen, 10, and Gracie, 4, who were also large infants. “They were very big babies,” Alexa explained to The Post. “But once they got a little older and started getting active, the weight just fell off.” The mom has weaned Kason off her breast milk, and he is now drinking formula. The chubby child is finally starting to lose his chubby cheeks and adorable arm rolls, something Alexa says is “kind of sad.” A 2011 study revealed almost a third of America’s babies are overweight, with 32% of tots weighing too much by the time they were 9 months old. But doctors say Kason’s case is an anomaly that is unrelated to poor nutrition and that he is otherwise in perfect health. And while his supersized status is slowly diminishing, Kason continues to stop his Upper West Side neighbors in the street, thanks to his cute smile and sweet demeanor. “He’s just the happiest baby,” Alexa cooed. “He’s always laughing and always smiling. He’s just the dream.”
