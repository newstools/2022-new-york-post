The headmaster of a Christian school in Louisiana — who was once a contestant on “Survivor” — has been accused of child abuse after allegedly taping shut the mouths of three 13-year-old students to punish them. Pastor John Raymond, 60, turned himself in Thursday on three counts of cruelty to juveniles, the Slidell Police Department said. Cops launched an investigation at the Lakeside Christian School after receiving a complaint from the state’s Department of Children and Family Services. Police said the headmaster became enraged after several students were “removed from a classroom for excessive talking” on March 18. He brought the kids to his office and “at some point, Raymond took a roll of packing tape and taped the students’ mouths shut by wrapping the tape around their heads,” according to police. “Raymond allegedly sent the students back to class for around 45 minutes before another school administrator felt uncomfortable with the situation and removed the tape from the students’ face,” cops said. The tape had to be removed with scissors, as it was wrapped completely around the students’ and was stuck in their hair, according to the statement. “During the encounter, the students claim they had trouble breathing and that the removal process was painful,” police said. After turning himself in, Raymond was moved to the St. Tammany Parish Jail where his bond will be set. Raymond was a contestant on CBS’ “Survivor: Thailand” in 2002, the hit reality show’s fifth season. He was the first pastor to compete on the show, according to IMDB — and also the first contestant voted off the island that season. Raymond told People Magazine that he will not be making any statements until next week.
