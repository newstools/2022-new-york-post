A pervert exposed himself and started pleasuring himself in front of a woman trapped with him inside an elevator, cops said on Saturday. The NYPD released a photo of the man they say committed the lewd act on March 23 at around 12:49 a.m. in the elevator of the 25-year-old woman’s apartment building in the vicinity of West 150th Street and Broadway in Manhattan. When the elevator doors opened on her floor, the woman ran out. Also on Saturday, the NYPD released photos of men they say were wanted for two separate disgusting incidents on subway trains. One man pleasured himself in front of a 13-year-old girl on a 1 train in Manhattan on March 7, cops said. Another man forcibly grabbed a women’s breasts on the N train in Brooklyn on Friday, according to the NYPD. Police are asking anyone with information on any of the incidents to contact NYPD’s Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS, on its website or via Twitter.
