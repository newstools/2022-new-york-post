It’s the end of an era for NFL quarterback Russell Wilson, who just listed his waterfront Seattle property for a whopping $36 million as his career with the Seattle Seahawks comes to a close. And Wilson, 33 — who’s heading to Colorado to play for the Denver Broncos — and his singer wife, Ciara, are hoping to score an enormous profit for the property, which he bought in 2015 for $6.7 million at the time. Made up of six bedrooms and five bathrooms, the estate spans more than 11,000 square feet and stands on nearly 2 acres of land, which features private beaches and gardens with Seattle skyline views, the listing notes. Wilson married Ciara a year after purchasing the property. In Colorado, he’ll be earning $37 million for the 2022 NFL season. Wilson and Ciara, 36, share two children. They all also shared this home, where amenities abound. Features include a tram to the the edge of the lake the home overlooks — and a dock with space for four boats, including a 60-foot yacht. There’s also a gym, a yoga studio, a sports court, play structure and a double jet ski lift. “The buyer of Russell and Ciara’s home will experience the ultimate in luxury living, allowing them to work hard and play hard without ever leaving the property,” Carmen Gayton, who holds the listing with Windermere Real Estate, told The Post. “Every part of this home from the kitchen to the treehouse allows you to live your best life right on the water’s edge with unforgettable views.” The kitchen features an expansive island, a walk-in pantry and a double oven. Meanwhile, the primary bedroom has an ornate fireplace, a large sitting area and with panoramic lake views.
