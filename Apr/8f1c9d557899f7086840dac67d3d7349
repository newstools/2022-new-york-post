Mayor Eric Adams on Monday said the city would cut the size of its massive vehicle fleet by at least 4 percent in the coming fiscal year in a push by City Hall to promote more sustainable travel options. Adams said the city would cull 855 vehicles from its fleet of 31,079 — saving the city $13.7 million and resulting in 5.13 million fewer miles of driving by municipal workers. “We want to encourage New Yorkers to get out of their cars and use alternative forms of transportation — and the city must lead by example,” Adams said. Hizzoner said the move would “achieve our sustainability goals, while simultaneously exercising greater fiscal responsibility.” He previously teased the fleet reductions in exclusive comments to The Post in January. “It is unimaginable that we have so many city vehicles moving around Manhattan,” Adams said at the time. The move to cut back on cars contrasts with his predecessor Bill de Blasio, who added thousands of vehicles to the fleet during his time in office. New York City owned 29,718 vehicles in Fiscal Year 2021, according to official city figures — a 15 percent increase from the year before de Blasio took office.
