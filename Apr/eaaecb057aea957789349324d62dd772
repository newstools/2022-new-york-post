China has turned the other cheek at Megan Thee Stallion’s recent booty-baring Coachella performance. Music fans in the heavily censored nation were able to tune in to the two-weekend festival in Indio, California, via the app WeChat, including the 27-year-old rapper’s performance on Saturday evening. In a farcical attempt to adhere to community standards on the Chinese social networking app, moderators used a floating black box to cover Megan and her dancers’ butts, but failed to keep up with their gymnastic twerking. Footage pulled from WeChat shows the black box wildly bounced from side to side, confusing viewers as to what exactly they were trying to censor. The restricted livestream took further liberties with the lyrics of “WAP,” Megan’s acronymic 2021 hit featuring Cardi B, remixing the X-rated phrase to “Wet Ass Puxi,” in reference to the district of Shanghai that is currently under lockdown amid a new surge of COVID-19. Warning: The clip below contains graphic language. The Grammy-winning artist also performed fan favorites including “Savage” and “Sweetest Pie.” Fans mocked the suppression snafu on Twitter. “That moment of sheer panic when the censor bar frantically jumps left and right because there’s just too much going on,” one described. “The person controlling the black box is the real MVP  just cover the whole screen hahahahahaha…” joked another. “Lol what’s the point of even streaming that act if it’s gonna look so silly?” one fan lamented.
