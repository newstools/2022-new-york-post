PORT ST. LUCIE — The Mets went the subway route in locating a lefty option for the bullpen. In a rare major league swap with the Yankees, the Mets acquired left-handed reliever Joely Rodriguez on Sunday for right-hander Miguel Castro. Rodriguez, 30, appeared in 52 games combined last season for the Rangers and Yankees and pitched to a 4.66 ERA. He will join Alex Claudio and Chasen Shreve as the left relief options in camp. Castro, 27, pitched to a 3.45 ERA in 69 appearances for the Mets last season. He will join Chad Green, Clay Holmes and Jonathan Loaisiga as right-handed setup options with the Yankees. The last previous swap of major league players between the Yankees and Mets occurred in 2004, when relievers Mike Stanton and Felix Heredia changed boroughs. In 2014, the Mets sent reliever Gonzalez Germen to the Yankees for cash considerations.
