Another suspected migrant flight landed in White Plains late Tuesday night, the fifth such flight in the past six days. The iAero airlines flight WQ491 from El Paso, Texas, via Jacksonville, Fla., landed at 10:33 p.m.The same iAero plane shuttled back and forth between El Paso and New York over Easter weekend. On Saturday, it landed at 11:33 p.m. On Monday it landed at 10:17 p.m. If it were not for The Post, the public would not be aware of any of the Biden administration’s charter flights, which are fanning out every night, all over the country, delivering illegal migrants from the southern border to oblivious communities. After a lull late last year, in recent weeks “the charters are back with a fury,” says a whistleblower from Avelo Airlines, one of three charter companies raking in millions of taxpayer dollars whisking migrants out of sight. Staffers are disturbed by the secrecy of the operation, and the prospect that they are participating in a human-trafficking operation, the whistleblower says. “The charters are not on our paperwork, not on the [air-traffic] breakdown, not on the schedule, not on the flight plan. They’re not listed anywhere.” The journey for illegal migrants through Mexico to the US border is facilitated by people-smuggling cartels but the flights into the interior of the country, provided by the Biden administration, are simply the last leg of that human-trafficking operation. Avelo employees have begun openly to discuss concerns that they may be participating in human trafficking, says the whistleblower, especially with so many ­unaccompanied minors on flights. “We’re trafficking children,” the whistleblower says. “I am not OK with that happening . . .“The company is saying it’s not true, but people don’t believe that, and everyone wants to leave. People stay for three months and leave.” Ironically, on Wednesday, Avelo staffers were ordered to watch a mandatory FAA training video on human trafficking, the second such video since December. She says both videos instructed staff to be aware of warning signs such as “if a kid doesn’t seem settled with the person they’re with or they don’t know their birthday or who their parents are. We have to ask or see and report anything suspicious. But when with charters, we don’t see who’s coming or going.” Avelo’s planes are based in Hollywood Burbank Airport in California, yet are shuttling back and forth from El Paso, Texas, to East Coast airports, usually via Florida. “Why are West Coast planes flying to the East Coast? Something’s wrong,” the whistleblower said. For an ultra-low-cost airline with only six planes, she says it has 80 pilots on its books, with salaries of $200,000 plus $20,000 bonuses. She claims the charters are worth $21,000 an hour up to a cap of $60,000, although her information is unconfirmed as yet. Three Avelo planes were out of service Tuesday in Burbank with mechanical problems, she said, and passengers on Avelo’s standard flights were being bumped. But charters went ahead. An e-mail to Avelo Chief Operating Officer Greg Baden yesterday afternoon went unanswered before publication. The migrant planes should start arriving more frequently, with numbers at the southern border expected to quadruple next month when the last remaining border restriction is nixed: the pandemic-related Title 42, which allowed migrants to be expelled on public-health grounds. The Post has monitored almost a dozen migrant flights into White Plains and Jacksonville, Fla., watching the planes land in the dead of night, photographing migrants boarding charter buses, and then attempting to follow the buses to their destinations. One bus last Thursday was followed by Post photographer Christopher Sadowski 130 miles south to the Walt Whitman Service Area in Cherry Hill, NJ, just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, arriving at around 12:45 a.m. on Good Friday. There it disgorged teenagers who were picked up by adults waiting to meet them, before the bus traveled to destinations unknown. The long journey by road begs the question: why didn’t the Biden administration just fly the migrants to Philadelphia instead of wasting money busing them down from White Plains? The White House, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services — which operates the flights for unaccompanied minors — have repeatedly refused to answer Post inquiries. When Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appears before Congress next week, Republicans should demand answers, instead of his usual evasions. But one private citizen, an avid plane spotter, has decided to take matters into his own hands, compiling a national database of suspected migrant flights over the past six months, which he published this week on Substack under the pseudonym ­“SocraticPatriot.” “Based on the information I uncovered, there is a systematic plan in place to move hundreds of thousands if not millions of migrants, often under the cover of darkness, to multiple states throughout the country,” says the data cruncher, who asked to remain anonymous. In the absence of transparency from the Biden administration, the patterns that can be discerned from the flight data paint a devastating picture of official deception and harm to the American people. More than 2.5 million illegal migrants have crossed into the US since Joe Biden took office. Among them were 42 people on the terror watchlist, according to CBP.Yet when White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about these suspected terrorists, she blew off the question, saying it was a tiny proportion of total illegal crossers.What a relief. On Wednesday, she told reporters the immigration system is “broken.”Yes, it is but it was Joe Biden who broke it. Hunter Biden’s former best friend Devon Archer has had a last-minute reprieve before his deadline next week to surrender to authorities and begin his jail term. The first son’s long-term business partner has been awarded a stay, by Manhattan federal Judge Ronnie Abrams, of the one-year-and-one-day sentence she imposed on Feb. 28, pending his appeal of a 2018 jury conviction for his role in a $60 billion securities fraud related to Burnham Financial Group, which was involved in the scheme. Archer’s six-year legal saga looks to stretch on for another couple of years. But as the spotlight focuses on Hunter Biden’s business dealings, the case in the Southern District of New York looks increasingly odd. It may be time to reassess Archer’s role in the Burnham scheme, and the role that politics played in his downfall. To all appearances he seems to be the fall guy, conned by his fellow defendants out of his own money that he invested in the failed financial-services firm. Dazzled by his alliance with the powerful Bidens, and frequent visits and golf games with the then-vice president, he has paid the political price. Like everyone associated with Hunter, his life has been ruined. And the middle-class Long Island native doesn’t have a father who is a billionaire or a president who can bail him out of trouble. Prosecutors accepted that Archer made no money from Burnham and in fact lost $800,000. Hunter was vice chairman of Burnham, and a 50-50 partner with Archer in the firm Rosemont Seneca through whose accounts $15 million in suspect bond proceeds were passed. He was never charged or accused of wrongdoing by prosecutors in the case. But unlike Archer, he actually made money from the company, according to an e-mail discovered on his laptop which documents his tax liabilities for 2015. The e-mail dated Jan. 16, 2017, was sent to Hunter Biden by Eric Scherwin, who at the time served as president of Rosemont Seneca. Scherwin itemized Hunter’s “increased income in 2015,” noting that he collected “$166,666 from Burnham in 2015. The evidence really suggests that both Archer and Hunter were ripped off. Judge Abrams initially overturned Archer’s conviction, stating the court’s belief in his innocence a total of six times in her judgment. Archer’s lawyer Matthew Schwartz said: “It is unfortunate that the judge, who has previously expressed concern that Mr. Archer is innocent of the crimes charged and reiterated that belief at sentencing, felt that she was constrained not to act on her independent assessment of the evidence.” Even after his conviction was reinstated on appeal, Abrams oddly urged Archer to maintain his “innocence” during his sentencing hearing. Something stinks.
