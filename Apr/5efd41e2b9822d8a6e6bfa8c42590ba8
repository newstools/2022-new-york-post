This looked like a scene out of the “MLB Slugfest” video game series. During a Binghamton Rumble Ponies (the Mets’ Double A affiliate) game against the Portland Sea Dogs (Red Sox), a wild brawl broke out after Portland’s Tyreque Reed was plunked with a pitch from Binghamton’s Marcel Renteria. After the pitch came in and hit Reed on the wrist, he began to walk to first base, but Renteria walked off the mound and the two appeared to exchange words. Then, Reed turned to the mound and charged it – throwing a hefty punch that knocked the pitcher to the ground. The catcher tackled Reed and the benches cleared from there, causing an all-out brawl that lasted for several moments. According to Sports Illustrated, both Reed and third baseman Brett Baty were ejected from the game. It’s been a testy baseball season so far in the junior leagues. Earlier in the week, a brawl broke out at a college game between North Central Texas and Weatherford after a pitcher tackled a batter after giving up a home run.
