Deebo Samuel wants out of San Francisco. The star wideout told ESPN’s Jeff Darlington that he has asked the 49ers for a trade. Samuel did not give a reason for why he wants to move on, but the move had been previewed earlier this month when he deleted all references to the team from his social media. Samuel was looking to sign an extension with the Niners that likely would have made him the league’s highest-paid receiver. It’s unclear why or how that didn’t happen, but according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Samuel also had issues with his usage. Rapoport also reported that Samuel’s request came over a week ago. Although Samuel has yet to be linked to another NFL team, the receiver appeared to “like” a tweet that stated how he’d look “awesome” in the Cowboys’ silver and blue. The 26-year-old South Carolina product had 1,405 receiving yards last season, fifth in the league, and led the NFL with 18.2 yards per reception. He also ran for 365 yards and had 14 total touchdowns. He was named to his first-ever All-Pro team. His contract will be the first order of business for any team looking to deal for him. Samuel has one year left at a $4.8 million cap hit before hitting unrestricted free agency. With the going rate for wide receivers skyrocketing after Christian Kirk’s mammoth deal with the Jaguars, Samuel is expected to command huge money with his next deal.
