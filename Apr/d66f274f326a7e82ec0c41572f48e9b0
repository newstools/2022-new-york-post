Multiple subway lines were suspended or facing big delays following Tuesday’s shooting at 36th Street station in Sunset Park, transit officials said. Riders should expect “major delays” on the D, F, M N, Q and R trains, the MTA said on Twitter. The local B and W lines are suspended entirely citywide. “Obviously it’s a disrupted day, but a lot of the system is up and running,” MTA CEO Janno Lieber said during a press conference alongside Gov. Kathy Hochul and NYPD officials. Segments of the D, N and R trains have been taken out of commission as the active investigation continues at 36th Street, the MTA said. D trains are running on the F line south of Broadway-Lafayette Street station, officials said, while the N is not running in Brooklyn between Atlantic Avenue and 8th Avenue.
