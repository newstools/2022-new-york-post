Hand it to President Joe Biden, he can still send the press corps haring off after an irrelevant comment, as he did by blaming inflation soaring to a new, four-decade high of 8.5% in March on Vladimir Putin’s “genocide” in Ukraine. His statement in Menlo, Iowa, did what it was intended to do. It made most of the media talk about Biden’s “first use” of that word, instead of his lie that he’s not to blame for inflation. But the actual policy change it signaled was  . . . nothing. Biden’s not deciding to send many more offensive weapons to Ukraine. He’s not calling for an international criminal court to try Putin. It doesn’t matter what label you put on the invaders’ horrific slaughter of innocents, only what you do to stop it, to reverse Putin’s gains and to make him pay. And Biden isn’t doing any of that. Nope, he’s doing one thing only: cynically using Putin to distract from his colossal domestic failures. Wednesday’s grim news that producer prices jumped 11.2% in March (over March 2021) means consumer prices will continue to soar in coming months. And no words out of Biden’s mouth will change that unless they’re “Drill, baby, drill” as he announces the end of his war on the US energy industry. Saying “genocide” doesn’t change US policy on Russia’s war on Ukraine, and it certainly doesn’t distract regular Americans from all the bills that are rising a lot faster than their take-home pay. That so much of the media fixated on the word is just another sign of how out of touch the nation’s “news” industry has grown.
