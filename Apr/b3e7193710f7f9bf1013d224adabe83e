Disturbing new details have emerged from the scene where Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins was killed by a dump truck on a Florida highway. While investigators have thus far declined to answer questions about the crash and will only release information after the case is closed, a witness — local resident Chris Stanley — told the Columbus Dispatch that he believes he saw the late quarterback on the highway before the collision, noticing vehicles veering into his lane. “And what I noticed was a Mack truck, or a big tractor-trailer, with also another vehicle that started moving a little bit to the left,” Stanley said. “I was in the left lane and then there was the right lane. And then I noticed an individual there starting to make their way onto the road. “He was about halfway, to a quarter way in the right lane, already onto the highway and I was already concerned that somebody was going to strike him right there at that moment,” he continued, noting that he saw the man raising his arms. The accident happened around 6:37 a.m. on I-595 West at the I-95 interchange outside Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. “I did not see any vehicle nearby. I was more concerned with him because he was already making his way onto the road system … That’s why it’s just very disturbing. I just didn’t understand the situation,” Stanley said. Haskins was pronounced dead on the scene. He was 24. The quarterback was a standout at Ohio State, throwing for 4,831 yards and 50 touchdowns during a stellar 2018 season. He was drafted in the first round by Washington, but was released during his second year. He then signed with the Steelers last season and was slated to compete for a backup position behind the newly signed Mitchell Trubisky. Haskins was training in South Florida with several of his Steelers teammates before his tragic death.
