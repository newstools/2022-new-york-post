Aaron Judge’s deadline for a contract extension has come and gone without a deal. The Yankees outfielder will take the field Friday afternoon against the Red Sox with the possibility of it being his final Opening Day in pinstripes, after the sides could not come to an agreement on a megadeal. Brian Cashman said the Yankees offered Judge, the face of the franchise, a deal that was worth an average annual value of $30.5 million over the next seven years for a total of $213.5. That is in addition to either $17 or $21 million this year, his final one of arbitration. “Our intent is to have Aaron Judge stay a New York Yankee moving forward,” Cashman said. In spring training, Judge had set Opening Day as his deadline for talks that were still ongoing Friday morning. The Yankees will still have a chance to negotiate exclusively with Judge after the season but at that point he will be weeks away from free agency. “Not now, but hopefully later,” Cashman said when asked for his message to the fanbase.
