Brandon Nimmo and Mark Canha were absent Friday from the Mets starting lineup – and Citi Field altogether – after testing positive for COVID-19, according to sources. In addition, bench coach Glenn Sherlock was absent following a positive test. The players were administered tests after they had been deemed in close contact with a staffer who had tested positive. Though both players tested positive, the source indicated they were asymptomatic. Nimmo and Canha were placed on the COVID injured list. Canha’s wife, Marci, tweeted that her husband is vaccinated. Nimmo declined to say in spring training if he was vaccinated. According to MLB guidelines, a player testing positive is out for 10 days, but an early return is possible with two negative tests. Two positive tests that meet a certain threshold can also expedite a player’s return. Nick Plummer and Matt Reynolds arrived from Triple-A Syracuse before first pitch against the Diamondbacks to fill out the Mets’ roster. “We are beyond sad to miss such a special day for our family,” Marci Canha tweeted. “We’ve been looking forward to opening day at Citi Field since the day Mark and I had lunch with Billy [Eppler] and Sandy [Alderson] in Arizona this past off season. “We’ve taken every precaution possible, we are vaccinated and boosted, all in our efforts to keep our kids, our family and friends healthy, but there’s a lot out of our control now.” Travis Jankowski received the start in center for the home opener and Jeff McNeil shifted to left field.
