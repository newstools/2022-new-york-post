Piers Morgan’s new TV show attracted an astonishing 64 million views across streaming and online video platforms in its first week, broadcast officials said Friday. “Piers Morgan Uncensored” launched April 25 with a fiery interview with former President Trump and has since welcomed guests including former Olympic medalist Caitlyn Jenner. “We are delighted that this new content has created so much interest and is driving our digital business forward, bringing in new audiences and new revenues,” said Scott Taunton, News UK’s executive vice president,  president of broadcasting, in a statement. The hit show’s total online views to date included “Uncensored” content on Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Youtube and News Corp-owned websites, including nypost.com, the statement said. That tally didn’t include TV viewership numbers in the UK or Australia nor streams on “Fox Nation” in the US, according to the release. Morgan, 57, returned to the airwaves for the first time since he stormed off the set of “Good Morning Britain” after criticizing Meghan Markle. The debut of “Uncensored” featured Morgan discussing a number of topics with Trump as well as pushing back against the former president’s claims the 2020 presidential election was “rigged.”
