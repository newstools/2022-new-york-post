He made it! Congratulations to Del Hall of Cincinnati. Hall gave up all food and drink, everything except beer, for Lent. “You can use beer in a healthy way.” Doctors are recommending a plant-based diet for Hall as he returns to his regular eating habits. No shot. Happy Easter, Del. Enjoy your beer-battered chicken! Stitches, thankfully gave up the NYC subways for Lent. The Mets and D’Backs have each lost a game at Citi Field. We are 2-0. So why leave? The rubber game is Sunday. The matchup is weak. Arizona’s Humberto Castellanos has appeared in two games (in relief) and has surrendered two earned runs in three innings. The Mets counter with David Peterson, who threw four innings in Philly last Monday without giving up a run. We have no faith in Peterson, but we have faith the Mets’ lineup will return to form. 10 units on the Amazin’s. Sergio Alcantara homered, Zac Gallen pitched four shutout innings and Seth Beer (a Del Hall favorite) went 3-for-3 in the D’backs’ 3-2 win over the Mets. Down -48 budweisers.
