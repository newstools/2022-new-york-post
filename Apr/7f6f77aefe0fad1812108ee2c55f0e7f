Urban Meyer’s days with the Jaguars may be over, but there are certain moments from his disastrous reign that the internet — let alone Pat McAfee — have yet to forget. During Wednesday’s installment of “The Pat McAfee Show,” the 34-year-old host discussed recent rumors about Meyer’s potential return to the small screen, advising the powers that be to encourage the 57-year-old coach to steer clear of the dance floor following a viral moment last fall. “Maybe it’s in the contract from the Fox people, no dance floors,” McAfee said. “We’ll pay you this, you gotta do this, show up do this, break this film down, give us the three things for everything… and then all of a sudden no dance floors on these college campuses.” Meyer ignited a firestorm of controversy after he was seen dancing at a bar with a woman — who was not his wife Shelley — following a Jaguars loss to the Bengals. Meyer stayed behind in Ohio while his team traveled back to Florida, which later resulted in an apology tour from the former college coach. The headlines didn’t stop there for Meyer, however. Not only was he accused of belitting his assistant coaches in a damning NFL.com report, but a former Jaguars player claimed he had kicked him during an August practice. Meyer was fired before the 2021 season came to an end. Though Meyer has not yet revealed his next career move, he’s swiftly closing the book on Jacksonville. Recently, he sold his Florida home for $2.3 million, the Jacksonville Daily Record reported Wednesday.
