So there are four realistic first-round opponents for the Rangers, who are two points off Carolina’s division lead and hold a game in hand with six contests remaining to the ’Canes’ five. That includes an April 26 head-to-head confrontation at the Garden. Barring an extreme development, when the puck drops for Game 1, the Penguins, the Capitals, the Bruins or the Lightning will be on the other side. An interlude here to provide a primer on tiebreakers: First comes regulation wins – Carolina has 43, the Rangers have 41. Next comes regulation and overtime victories (meaning all of the non-shootout variety) – Carolina has 48, the Rangers have 45. Third, in the unlikely event this would come into the play, comes overall victories – both teams have 49.
