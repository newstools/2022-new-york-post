In this wild winter with two frenzied acquisition sessions, there were some clear winners, some stark sellers (A’s, Reds) and the usual do-nothings (you know them). The biggest winter winner of all has to be the Mets, who look improved early despite the usual rotation woes (more on that below) and should take a major step forward after a rough transition year, making arguably the biggest splash with the record deal for Max Scherzer and three very good adds to a lineup that only hit when it didn’t count last year — Starling Marte, Mark Canha and Eduardo Escobar. Second-year owner Steve Cohen’s largesse was spent well. Without further ado, our top nine winter performers. 1. Mets. With deferred payments from the Nats that dwarf Bobby Bonilla Day, Scherzer will make $58.3 million this year — or $20 million more than anyone else. 2. Rangers. Gotta love that half-a-billion-dollar double-play combo, Corey Seager and Marcus Semien. 3. Tigers. They tried for Carlos Correa at $275 million but did get Javier Baez, Eduardo Rodriguez, Austin Meadows and Andrew Chafin for less. 4. Blue Jays. Clear favorite in stacked AL East. 5. Mariners. Even this known M’s detractor tips a cap to Robbie Ray, Jesse Winker and Co. 6. Braves. Hometown star Matt Olson brings the extra years Freddie Freeman wanted. 7. Dodgers. Freeman replaces Seager, Craig Kimbrel replaces Kenley Jansen. 8. Giants. They lost their best pitcher in Kevin Gausman and best player in the Cooperstown-bound Buster Posey, but rallied with a string of prescient moves. 9. Twins. While one rival suggested they were “spinning wheels,” the Correa signing brought huge goodwill to the Twin Cities, and late rotation adds give them a postseason chance.
