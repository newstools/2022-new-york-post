Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training action on Sunday: Isiah Kiner-Falefa crushed his first home run of the spring, a two-run shot to left field in the first inning. The shortstop, who worked with Justin Turner and his hitting coach, Doug Latta, during the offseason, has put a focus on getting the ball in the air more. Luis Gil, one of the Yankees’ young pitchers fighting to make the roster as a long relief option, gave up five earned runs on eight hits over 2 ¹/₃ ⅓ innings. He also made an error as Bo Bichette stole third base, throwing to the bag before Josh Donaldson could get there, which allowed two runs to score. Tim Locastro put his speed on full display in the fourth inning, hitting a line drive to the gap for what looked like a double before taking third once he saw left fielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr. slip after fielding the ball. Locastro’s wheels give him a shot to make the team as an extra outfielder. Left-hander JP Sears will get the start against the Phillies at 1:05 p.m. at Steinbrenner Field in the Yankees’ penultimate Grapefruit League game.
