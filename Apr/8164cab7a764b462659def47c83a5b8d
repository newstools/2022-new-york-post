Lockdown restrictions in China’s most populous city will soon be lifted in areas that go two weeks without reporting new cases of COVID-19, authorities confirmed Saturday. Large swaths of Shanghai have been under lockdown since March 28, and nearly all of its 26 million residents are confined at home, leading to complaints about shortages of food and other basic necessities. Another round of mass testing comes as Shanghai reported about 23,000 cases on Saturday, most of them asymptomatic. During a news conference Saturday, Shanghai Vice Mayor Zong Ming said sections of the city will now be classified as “precautionary,” “controlled” or “locked down,” depending on the results of the testing. Residents in areas deemed “precautionary” with no infections over the past 14 days will be able to move around their districts, but gatherings will be restricted. In “controlled” areas, residents can move around in their neighborhoods, which are smaller than districts. “Locked down” areas will require everyone to stay at home. “There is still a big gap from everyone’s expectations,” Ming said. “We will do our best to improve it.” Following mass complaints, Shanghai on Wednesday lifted an unpopular isolation policy that separated children from their parents if they tested positive. China is facing one of its worst local outbreaks since the pandemic began. It is one of the only countries sticking to a “zero-COVID” policy, taking drastic measures such as lockdowns, closing international travel and enforcing mass testing to identify and isolate every case.
