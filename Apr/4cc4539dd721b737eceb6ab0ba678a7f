“American Idol” winner Laine Hardy announced Thursday that he is under investigation by the Louisiana State University Police Department. Hardy, 21, revealed the news in a Thursday night Facebook post, saying the LSUPD issued “a warrant due to allegations made against me.” The country crooner did not specify what he was accused of but noted he was “fully cooperative” with cops as nearly two thousand of his fans posted messages of support. “I understand that my career has thrust me into the public spotlight, and I embrace that wholeheartedly as my entire world belongs to my music and my fans,” he wrote. “However, due to the sensitive nature of this allegation, I humbly ask for privacy at this time. I have the utmost respect for the law and will assist in their investigation as needed moving forward.” LSU confirmed there was an active investigation against the musician, according to WAFB-TV. Hardy won ABC’s “Idol” in 2019 and is known for his hits “Memorize You” and “Flame.”
