This 19-year-old Instagram influencer just bought her first home in the East Village. Olivia Ponton, who is also a “Sports Illustrated Rookie 2022” — and goes by “Olivia Marie” to her 3.5 million followers — paid $1.25 million, the full asking price, for her new digs. The one-bedroom, 1½-bath condo is at the A Building, 425 E. 13th St. It was on the market a mere 17 days, according to StreetEasy. The 753-square-foot unit also boasts a home office, private terrace, and full-size washer/dryer — along with new hardwood floors, high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. An open living room invites entertaining, as does the chef’s kitchen, which comes with a large pantry. A king-sized bedroom has custom closets and an ensuite bathroom. The apartment is also smart-wired with motorized shades, in-ceiling stereo speakers and recessed lighting. The sellers bought the unit for $859,000 in 2011. The 95-unit, eight-story building dates to 2007 and features a rooftop pool with cabanas — perfect for those Insta moments — and a gym. There’s also a package room and bike storage. Past residents include Olympic snowboarder Shaun White. The listing brokers are Rachel Glazer and Ilana Lee of Compass.
