NHL underdogs finally got off the schneid on Monday, winning three of the six games on the card and halting a 22-game win streak for favorites that lasted three nights. NHL Favorites are now 786-429 on the season, giving the chalk its highest win rate (64.7%) since at least 2005-06 when the NHL did away with ties. According to Action Labs, if you blindly bet $100 on every NHL favorite this season, you’d be up $2,582 for a +2.1% ROI. Tuesday night looks like it could be another ugly night for the dogs, however, as there are six games that feature favorites of -200 or longer, including the Tampa Bay Lightning, who are -550 against the Detroit Red Wings. Tampa Bay will likely become the sixth NHL favorite to close at -500 or shorter this season. In a league that loves to sell fans on parity, the NHL has been anything but in 2021/22. But that doesn’t mean that bettors should just look away from every underdog for the rest of the season. Should punters be careful and perhaps think twice before playing a pooch in the NHL? Sure. But there will be some spots that are too good to pass up. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: Senators +1.5 (-120) vs. Canucks -1.5 (+100) Moneyline: Senators (+200) vs. Canucks (-250) Total: Over 6.5 (-115) | Under 6.5 (-105) One of those spots may be Tuesday’s showdown between the Ottawa Senators and Vancouver Canucks. The Vancouver Canucks collected two huge points against the Dallas Stars on Monday night, winning their sixth game on the spin and moving within four points of Los Angeles for the final playoff spot in the Pacific Division. Vancouver has a game in hand on the Kings and the two teams will meet on the last day of the season. Just 24 hours after their emotional, impressive win over the Stars, the Canucks will be big favorites when they welcome the Ottawa Senators to Rogers Arena. Ottawa has been out of the playoff picture all season, but overlook the Sens at your own risk. Ottawa is 15-24 as an underdog of +150 or longer this season, giving them a win rate of 38.5% and an ROI of +14.3% for a $100 bettor. Currently, the Senators are sitting at +210 for their encounter with the red-hot Canucks. While the Canucks have been playing a strong 5-on-5 game during their winning streak, good fortune and strong goaltending have also played a part. Vancouver is generating 2.74 expected goals per 60 minutes in its last six games, but the team is scoring 4.06 goals per 60 in that span thanks to a sky-high 13.3% shooting percentage at even strength. That number will eventually tick down, as will the team’s 96% save percentage at 5-on-5. There’s no question that this line is a little inflated because of the situation. Bookmakers will often bake in a “must-win” tax on a team in a situation like the one Vancouver is in on Tuesday, but just because a team is in a “must-win” spot doesn’t mean they will. Just ask the Golden Knights, who lost as big favorites against the Devils in a game Vegas needed to have on Monday night. Senators vs. Canucks bet: Ottawa Senators +200 or better (+205 on Caesars)
