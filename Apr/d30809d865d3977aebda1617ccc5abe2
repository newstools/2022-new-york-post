Tim Feerick, the bass player for the experimental rock band Dance Gavin Dance, died Wednesday. The California band announced the 34-year-old’s death in a Thursday social media post. “We are absolutely devastated to share the news that our friend and bass player, Tim Feerick, passed away last night,” the band said in a statement. “We ask that you respect our privacy and that of Tim’s family while we deal with this heartbreaking and untimely loss.” Feerick’s cause of death was not disclosed. The bassist first joined the Sacramento-based group in 2009 and played on six albums, Billboard reported. Fans paid tribute to Feerick and shared their anguish on the musician’s Instagram page. “I will forever be heartbroken about your death you brought so much joy to my life with the music. Rest in peace you beautiful soul,” one wrote. Dance Gavin Dance was set to depart on a 19-date national tour later this month, according to their website. The band, who combines elements of punk, screamo and jazz fusion, has sold more than a million albums and been streamed more than a billion times on Spotify.
