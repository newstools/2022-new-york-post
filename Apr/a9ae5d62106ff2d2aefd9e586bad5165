Seven people were taken away in cuffs as city sanitation workers broke up a homeless encampment in the East Village on Wednesday, officials confirmed. The encampment sweep at Avenue D and 9th Street around 4 p.m. is the latest in Mayor Eric Adams’ plan to clear the makeshift housing from Big Apple streets as homeless advocates have decried City Hall’s policy. Four people had been living at the site, sources said, and one of them was among the seven arrested. It was unclear what charges the seven were facing. The three other people living at the encampment refused offers to move into city shelters, which have been plagued by years of dangerousness complaints. Photos from the scene show sanitation workers dismantling tents as a garbage truck is parked in the street. City workers had “engaged” for weeks with those living at the East Village encampment before Wednesday’s sweep, according to a spokesperson for the mayor’s office. “Our teams then and today were respectful and made repeated offers of shelter and wraparound services to provide these individuals with clean, safe places to sleep tonight,” the spokesperson said. “We will not be dissuaded from offering those on the streets the support they deserve, while ensuring that our public spaces remain clean for all New Yorkers.”
