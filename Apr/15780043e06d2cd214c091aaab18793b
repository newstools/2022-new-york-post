Shanghai reportedly aims to have zero COVID-19 cases outside of its quarantine centers by Wednesday, in what could be a turning point for the city’s strict “no tolerance” lockdowns that’ve left residents increasingly frustrated. The target will allow the city to further ease its lockdown and start returning to normal life, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. In order to meet the goal Wednesday, officials will accelerate COVID testing and the transfer of infected residents to quarantine centers, according to a speech by a local Communist Party official. Shanghai imposed strict lockdowns in response to an outbreak driven by the Omicron variant. Since the surge began in early March, the city has counted 320,000 cases. Under the “no tolerance” policy, only healthcare workers, volunteers, delivery personnel and those with special permission are able to move freely. The strict rules mean that quarantined residents have to order in food or wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs, BBC reported. Frustrated Shanghai residents, however, have expressed anger on social media over what they say are shortages of food and other items. Footage posted to Twitter showed people in the locked-down city banging pots on their balconies and chanting, “We want supplies,” France24 reported. “We want supplies,” the quarantined residents reportedly chanted.
