What’s the 411? The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul and her commitment to the music industry is about to be further immortalized.Mary J. Blige will receive the Icon Award at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Sunday, May 15. This will be her 11th Billboard Music Award, including album of the year and nine trophies for female R&B/hip-hop artist of the year and female Hot 100 artist. Previous recipients of The Billboard Icon Award include Pink, Garth Brooks, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson and Cher. Blige has been busy this past year, releasing her 14th album “Good Morning Gorgeous,” her 2022 Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar — and let’s not forget her starring role on Starz’s “Power Book II: Ghost” series. Blige has expanded into acting, producing and being an entrepreneur, but she always comes back to her where she started — the music. “My career has been such an incredible and unexpected journey that has included many turns into avenues I never could have imagined like acting, producing, launching businesses, and now even my own music festival,” Blige said in a statement. “Through it all, I always one way or another gravitated back to my first love, music. To be recognized in this way at this moment, with the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards, is an incredible honor and one that I am truly humbled by.” Expect a show-stopping performance from Blige as she accepts her iconic award. Many fans will likely hope she performs her top hits and does her infamous two-step stomp. Regardless it will all be “Just Fine.”
