A mind-bending optical illusion can reveal a lot about you and the mindset you have. The visual puzzle, created by Bright Side, can apparently tell if you’re stuck in the past or easy for the future, depending on what you see. So what does it say about you? The image shows a man on a horse with a dog at its feet, but it all depends on what direction the horse is walking in. According to the puzzle, if you see the horse walking forwards, it means you’re always looking for the good to come in the future. You can’t wait for great things to come into your life and are excited about the future. However, if you see the horse walking backward, it might mean you are stuck in the past. You might be feeling nostalgic about the past and thinking about what could have been done differently, making you a more thoughtful person. So what way did you see the horse walking and is it time for you to let go of the past? Or are you the kind of person who is always thinking ahead? Bright Side added: “Do you really know the TRUE you? “Maybe you thought you’re an introvert when you were actually an extrovert this whole time!? “Are you a logical, analytical thinker, or do you base most of your decision-making on gut feelings, intuition, or emotions? “This optical illusions personality test will reveal it all!” And users were blown away, one wrote: “This is so accurate Bright Side, keep it up!” “Got to know a lot about myself!!” Another added.
