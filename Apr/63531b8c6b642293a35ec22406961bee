Slow to respond to inflation, Ukraine and the border problem, the White House is holding the Easter Egg Roll … on Monday. All good, just don’t tell Joe. Same old Generals. Birmingham 28, New Jersey 24. Donald Trump on his former team: “It’s a disgrace. They have no idea what they are doing.” A friendly reminder General, taxes are due at midnight. We are 3-0 at Citi Field. Pushing our luck. The Giants are in this week so the Mets will have to step up considering the upgrade in talent. Alex Cobb (8-3 last year for the Angels) picked up a win in his first start for San Francisco, limiting the Padres to two runs over five frames. Two starts, two wins for the Mets’ Tylor Megill, and he hasn’t given up a run in 10 ¹/₃ innings. Play 10 units on the Mets. Amazin! David Peterson scattered three hits over 4 ¹/₃ innings, Pete Alonso homered, and the Mets rolled on Easter Sunday, blanking the D’backs 5-0. Our Citi Field triple play has us in positive territory. Up +2 pignatanos.
