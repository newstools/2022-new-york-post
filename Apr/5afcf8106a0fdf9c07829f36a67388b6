A wall of flame looks about to engulf a police officer on a bomb-training course with echoes of The Hurt Locker. And a courageous technician in a full-face helmet and protective clothing appears to walk away with a disposal kit as two devices go off. The pair were on a two-week course for officers in Nanning, China, learning to deal with scenarios like those in the 2008 bomb disposal movie. The drills include searching for bombs and defusing them. The military exercise was for officers from the People’s Armed Police of Guangxi, in the south of the country.
