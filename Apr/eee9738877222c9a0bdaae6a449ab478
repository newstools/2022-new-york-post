Elemis has you covered — literally — with its Peptide4 Plumping Pillow Facial. It just sounds luxurious and something worth grabbing on sale ASAP. There’s nothing more popular right now than under-eye patches. Elemis’ best-selling Pro-Collagen Hydra-Gel Eye Masks help to hydrate, smooth and tighten the delicate under-eye area (and, is especially great for fine lines). For a soothing cleanser, this gentle one from Elemis is just under $35 right now (that said, it’s worth running to). Its pump applicator makes using it daily seamless, too. Enter Elemis’ Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Pads. If your skin is feeling dull and in need of a pick-me-up, this tub is worthwhile to have on hand, alongside your favorite serums and toners.
