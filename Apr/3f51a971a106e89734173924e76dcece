Five people who helped provide “critical information” about accused Brooklyn terrorist Frank James will split a $50,000 reward offered by the NYPD, cops announced Friday. “We appreciate all of those who responded to our call for information to locate this suspect, including all of those whose tips did not pan out,” Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said in a statement. “We urged the public to join us in this effort to find this suspect and New Yorkers stepped up.” James, 62, was arrested Wednesday following a nearly 30-hour manhunt — and after calling the police on himself in the East Village. The feds filed terrorism charges against James in connection to the mass shooting on a Manhattan-bound N train in the 36th Street stop in Sunset Park Tuesday morning. He was held without bail. The combined reward, which came from contributions from the Police Foundation, the MTA and TWU Local 100, will be split evenly between the five people, according to the NYPD. “Thanks to the help of these five good Samaritans, the NYPD was able to do its job and get a dangerous suspect off the streets just hours after his picture was released,” said Mayor Eric Adams. Officials didn’t name the good Samaritans who would be receiving the windfall. But a few have spoken to reporters about springing into action after spotting James. “I thought, ‘Oh s–t, this guy, let me call the police.’ And I call ’em and we catch him,” Zack Tahhan, 21, said, according to video posted on Twitter. Mohammed Chikh also notified police and witnessed James’ arrest. “He didn’t fight, he didn’t do anything, he totally surrendered,” Chikh told The Post.
