The Memphis Grizzlies evened their first-round playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves with a 124-96 victory on Tuesday night. Now the Grizzlies travel on the road for Game 3 against a Wolves team that has been downright dominant at home, going 26-15. Still, this line feels short for a Grizzlies team that finished with the second-best record in the Western Conference. Although this series is tied 1-1, the Grizzlies have an expected winning percentage of 90% (per Shotquality.com), underperforming their shot quality in Game 1 while winning as expected in Game 2. Nonetheless, we’re getting the better team at a short price as my model makes this spread Grizzlies -3. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: MEM -1.5 (-115) vs. MIN +1.5 (-105) Moneyline: MEM (-125) vs. MIN (+105) Total: Over 237.5 (-110) | Under 237.5 (-110) Numbers aside, Taylor Jenkins found the key to winning this series in Game 3, wasting no time to make the first adjustment by removing Steven Adams from the lineup by going small to match up with Karl-Anthony Towns. Jaren Jackson, Brandon Clarke, Xavier Tillman, and Kyle Anderson were all key factors, allowing the team to switch on defense, get up and down the floor, and hit 3s on offense. And in Game 2, the Grizzlies got back to doing what they’re best at: Forcing turnovers and dominating the offensive glass, both of which I expect to continue in Game 3.  Even with a 28-point victory in Game 2, I believe we still haven’t seen the best from Ja Morant and Desmond Bane, and that the Grizzlies still have another gear they can get to. They’re the better team and have more solutions to any issues that may come up in this series. With the Timberwolves being the younger, more inexperienced, and more undisciplined team, I’ll back the Grizzlies to go up 2-1 here by laying 1.5 points. The pick: Grizzlies -1.5
