Viewers have been left stumped trying to determine how many shapes are in this photo. This optical illusion creates a series of triangles, squares and lines, but most viewers are shocked to learn that all of these shapes are created with just two objects. Using just two sticks balanced against a wall, Lappert is able to create the illusion of several different lines and shapes. He uses lighting and shadow techniques to shine a spotlight on his sticks, making them project several shapes on the wall behind. He then photographs the shapes, allowing viewers to see several different figures instead of just two. Using what Lappert calls light work, he is able to create amazing and detailed photographs with just one or two objects. Most of his sculptures are created with everyday objects including wooden sticks, foam, metal bars, bike parts and spotlights.
