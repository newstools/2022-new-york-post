A Pennsylvania man injured Philadelphia police officers during a car chase Tuesday night after he pointed a gun at another driver during a road rage incident, authorities said. Officers responded to a call for a driver with a gun around 9:30 p.m. near Witte Street and Allegheny Avenue, Philadelphia police said. Officers located the caller who told them that a man inside a white Toyota pointed a gun at him during a road rage incident. Police quickly located the suspect’s vehicle, but the driver sped away when officers attempted to stop him, according to authorities. During the pursuit that followed, a Police Air Tactical Unit followed the vehicle until the driver crashed head-on with a police cruiser with officers inside. Police didn’t immediately say how many officers were in the vehicle. The injured officers were rushed to Jefferson-Torresdale Hospital, where they were treated and released. The vehicle came back in stolen status for carjacking and kidnapping from Pittsburgh. Police identified the driver as 24-year-old Malik Johnson, of Horsham, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, police determined that the vehicle Johnson was driving was stolen in a carjacking and kidnapping in Pittsburgh. No further details were immediately released. Johnson faces a slew of charges, including three counts of simple assault, three counts of recklessly endangering another person, two counts of aggravated assault, three counts of criminal mischief, and a single count each of fleeing police and unauthorized use of auto.
