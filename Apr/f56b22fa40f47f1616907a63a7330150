A Los Angeles gang member convicted of murder praised District Attorney George Gascón for his controversial criminal justice reforms that reduced the inmate’s charges — and vowed to get the embattled DA’s name tattooed on his face, a report said. Luis Angel Hernandez, who pleaded guilty to murder and personal use of a firearm for the 2018 killing of a marijuana delivery person, gushed about the Los Angeles County DA in a jailhouse phone call – the audio of which was obtained by Fox News. “I’m going to get that n—–’s name on my face. That’s a champ right there. F—in’ Gascón,” Hernandez, a member of the OTF gang, says in the call, according to the report. “He’s making historic changes for all of us, fool. I’m just grateful, fool. Like, I got good news off that s–t,” Hernandez says. In the phone call, Hernandez cites Gascón’s controversial decision to bar sentencing enhancements in nearly all cases. Hernandez initially faced a life sentence without the possibility of parole and faced several enhancements, including one for his gang affiliation and another for committing murder during an armed robbery, the report said. But those enhancements were dropped thanks to the rollbacks by Gascón, who took office in December 2020, law enforcement sources told Fox News. “This s–t looking real good. Now we got a new DA in LA … so they’re going to drop a gang of, um, like my gun enhancement, my gang enhancement,” says Hernandez in the jailhouse call. “My gang enhancement is 10 years, fool, for being a gang member. And then the gun in the commission of a crime.” Details on Hernandez’s new sentencing guidelines weren’t immediately clear. But, according to Fox News, he will qualify for youthful offender parole, which would limit his sentence to 25 years.
