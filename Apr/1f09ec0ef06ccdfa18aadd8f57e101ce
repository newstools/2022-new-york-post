The gunman was fighting with one of the men outside Fresh Slice Pizza at Stanton Street and Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side around 4:15 a.m. when he whipped out his pistol and blasted his rival in the groin, according to police. A third man, who was working as a bouncer at the nearby Piano Bar and had walked to the pizza place to get food, was shot in the left leg, a police source said. He collapsed on the sidewalk until emergency workers arrived. The victims were taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. The shooter, who was described as standing 6-foot-2 and wearing all gray, fled, cops said.
