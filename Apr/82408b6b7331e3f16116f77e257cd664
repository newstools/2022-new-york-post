RALEIGH, N.C. — Kyle Palmieri scored with 14.1 seconds remaining in a wild final minute to lift the Islanders to a 2-1 win over the Hurricanes on Friday night. Ilya Sorokin needed only 19 saves to pick up the victory, though he was less than a minute away from matching the Islanders’ record for shutouts in a season. But Vincent Trocheck’s goal with 56.8 seconds to play tied the score at 1-1 for Carolina. Still, the Islanders won for the fifth time in their last six games — thanks to Palmieri’s clutch goal. “We’re just playing good hockey right now,” left wing Matt Martin said. Yet with 12 games to play, the Islanders remain a long shot in the Eastern Conference playoff race. They’re 11 points out of the last qualifying spot. “They’re a desperate team,” Hurricanes defenseman Tony DeAngelo said. “They’re still in it. They’ve got to win just about almost every game to get in.” Jean-Gabriel Pageau also scored for the Islanders, and Palmieri had an assist on that goal. “We’re getting good results,” left wing Zach Parise said. “We’re not going to quit. We’re going to keep going.” A night after clinching a playoff spot for the fourth year in a row, the Hurricanes weren’t crisp at all on their way to losing for the third time in four games. Frederik Andersen made 19 saves. Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said there was a lack of energy at times and then the Hurricanes were teased with the possibility of at least gaining a team point. “That’s a tough way to end the game,” Brind’Amour said. Trocheck’s tying goal came after the Hurricanes pulled Andersen for an extra skater. Trocheck didn’t have a goal or assist in the previous five games. Then Palmieri powered his way to the front of the net with control of the puck to knock in the winning goal. Sorokin appeared for the first time in the Islanders’ past six games, with his previous outing coming March 27. He wasn’t threatened during stretches by the Metropolitan Division’s highest-scoring team.
