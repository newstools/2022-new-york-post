A young woman has been crushed to death after “something went wrong” while operating a mixing machine at a bread factory. The freak accident took place Saturday afternoon at Automatic Rolls of North Carolina (Northeast Foods) in Clayton. Officials said Bibiana Arellano Delabra, 22, was operating a large industrial mixing machine when “something went wrong” and crushed her. Investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are looking into the incident. Northeast Foods is one of the largest suppliers of buns, rolls and bread products in the US. The company said it will work with OSHA throughout the investigation. “We are devastated by the accident that occurred over this weekend that resulted in the tragic loss of one of our employees,” the company said. “We remain committed to working with OSHA and all pertinent parties to conduct a thorough and comprehensive investigation into this unthinkable tragedy.” On Monday, Delabra’s family told ABC11 that her parents were seeking legal counsel and declined to comment further. Northeast Foods is currently closed as the investigation into Delabra’s death continues. This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
