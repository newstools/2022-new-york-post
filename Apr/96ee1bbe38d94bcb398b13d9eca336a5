Florida rapper YK Osiris will cover funeral costs for the Missouri teen who died after a horrific plunge from an Orlando amusement park ride, according to a report. The rapper said he will help the family of Tyre Samson, 14, who fell from the now-closed Free Fall ride at ICON Park as it plummeted 430 feet at upwards of 75 mph earlier this month, TMZ reported. “I know they was waiting on the amusement park to do their thing,” Osiris said. “But things have to happen quicker.” The rapper — who has 2.9 million Instagram followers — told TMZ that he has been communicating with Samson’s gutted family. “It was just a devastating thing for his parents … so I had to make it happen,” Osiris said of his gesture. The 23-year-old rhymer from Jacksonville, whose real name is Osiris Jahkail, said well-compensated celebrities should make more of an effort to assist those in need. “In the celebrity world, we have too much power and big platform to not help with things like that,” he said. Osiris noted that he would attend the ceremony if asked. Samson’s parents have retained attorney Benjamin Crump and are considering legal action against the amusement park. Ride staffers told Florida investigators that Samson’s safety harness was still in a locked position after the ride came to a rest but officials are still investigating the incident and have yet to issue final conclusions. Samson’s father has highlighted that his son — who weighed over 300 pounds — had been turned away from other rides due to safety concerns stemming from his size. “Be careful when seeing if large guests fit into the seats,” a manual for the attraction states. “Check that they fit within the contours of the seat and the bracket fits properly. If this is not so — Do not let this person ride.”
