The Grammys haven’t even officially started — but the Will Smith jokes have. “I want to warn you all that our next presenter is a comedian. If you know what I mean,” LeVar Burton said while hosting the Grammys’ “premiere ceremony,” which was held hours before Sunday’s televised main event and doles out the majority of the music awards. “So I need to caution everybody: Remain in your seats and keep your hands to yourself. Alright?” the actor and host joked at the afternoon ceremony. Comedian Nate Bargatze then walked onto the stage wearing a large black helmet. “They said comedians have to wear these now at award shows during their joke parts,” he said, as some audience members appeared shocked. “It doesn’t even cover your face, I think it just focuses where you would hit me.” Follow the 2022 Grammys with our up-to-the-minute coverage:  Burton and Bargatze were of course referencing the slap heard ’round the world last Sunday when actor Will Smith smacked comedian Chris Rock in the face for making a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who suffers from alopecia. Smith, who went on to win a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in “King Richard,” was facing possible expulsion or suspension by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences when he resigned from the organization Friday.
