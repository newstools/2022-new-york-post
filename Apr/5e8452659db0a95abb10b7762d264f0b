A teen Florida driver careened into a canal, leaving him and a Good Samaritan who jumped into the water to rescue him dead, officials said. The unidentified driver, 18, skidded into the canal near the Residence of Sawgrass Mills area in Sunrise at roughly 10:30 p.m. Tuesday night, NBC Miami reported. A 17-year-old boy who was walking with his mother nearby witnessed the accident and rushed into the canal to help, officials said. But he was unsuccessful in getting the driver out of his car and had to be pulled from the water by first responders who rushed to the tragic scene. Witnesses said responding units struggled to locate both teens in the darkened waters. The Good Samaritan was eventually located and rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. “It’s very sad, very brave act to do something like that,” area resident Gary Grove told NBC Miami. “It’s sad to lose your life over that. My condolences to the family.” Police have not yet released the identities of the two teens. Officials believe the driver became lost in the area and made a wrong turn before plunging into the canal.
