A mugger shoved a 26-year-old pregnant woman to the ground and then robbed her in Queens, new video shows. The victim was walking at 131st Street and Liberty Avenue in South Richmond Hill just after 6 a.m. March 9, carrying an umbrella, when the suspect – heading in the other direction – pulled on her purse and knocked her onto the sidewalk, according to police and the video. The clip, released late Monday, then shows the attacker grabbing the woman’s purse and running off. The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for pain in her stomach and scrapes on her hands, cops said. No arrests have been made.
