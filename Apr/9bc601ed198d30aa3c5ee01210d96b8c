Nike probably shouldn’t sponsor the National Spelling Bee anytime soon. After Duke lost Saturday to North Carolina in the Final Four and retiring coach Mike Krzyzewski’s career ended, Nike published a couple of Tweets as part of a campaign that left social media users confused. “You can’t spell championship with K,” Nike Basketball’s verified account tweeted. As many grade-schoolers know, there’s no ‘K’ in the word ‘championship,’ even if Krzyzewski’s nickname is “Coach K.” Maybe the ad would’ve landed better if he was known as “Coach C.” It’s just as difficult to spell Crzyzewski after all. Krzyzewski won five national championships (all between 1991 and 2015), which is second only to UCLA’s John Wooden. But Krzyzewski holds a 13-12 edge over Wooden in career trips to the Final Four. Nike also tweeted a video ad that showed a string of words that “you can’t spell without K.” The list: Honor, respect, brotherhood, gold, Cameron, crazies, Durham, family, legacy and coach. The point? All those things are synonymous with a legendary career that ended in heartbreak at the hands of an archrival. Duke switched from Adidas to Nike sponsorships in 1993, after winning back-to-back national titles. There is a fitness building on the Nike campus in Oregon named after Coach K.
