Social media watchdogs are already barking about the 2022 Grammys awarding Louis C.K. with Best Comedy Album honors. “Sincerely Louis CK” beat out recordings by fellow comics Kevin Hart, Nate Bargatze, Lewis Black, Chelsea Handler and Lavell Crawford. This is C.K.’s first comedy special since the canceled joker admitted to masturbating in front of a group of women without their consent in 2017. C.K., 54, was not present to receive what many are calling his “uncanceled” award. “Damn, I will accept this on his behalf,” award presenter and actor LeVar Burton, 65, said. Social media immediately lit up, with Twitter users condemning C.K. and the Recording Academy, all while dragging infamous Oscars slapper Will Smith into the drama. “I don’t want to hear anything else about Will Smith now that Louis C.K. not only was nominated but just won an award #GRAMMYs,” one Twitter critic sniped as another snarkily chimed in: “Louis CK just won a whole ass Grammy while y’all are either calling for Will Smith’s head or crying about cancel culture. There are no consequences for white cishet men.” Follow the 2022 Grammys with our up-to-the-minute coverage:
