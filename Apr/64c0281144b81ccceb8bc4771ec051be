A Tennessee college athlete was killed and two of his teammates were injured when they were struck by a driver while running in Virginia Thursday evening, school officials said. Milligan University sophomore Eli Cramer, a member of the Christian school’s track & field team, died in the crash at an intersection in Lightfoot, Va. just after 6 p.m., according to reports and the university. Seniors Alex Mortimer and Eli Baldy were also injured in the incident, which came on the eve of a track meet in the area, according to the school. Baldy, a mechanical engineering student, was treated and released from Sentara Williamsburg Regional Medical Center. Mortimer underwent surgery and is in stable condition. He said he suffered a broken leg and dislocated shoulder, according to a video on the university’s Facebook page. “I want to exhort and thank all of you all for praying for me, for the Milligan team and for the university and institution,” Mortimer, a ministry major, said from his hospital bed. “I want to say that moments like this make you realize what is and is not important in your life.” The victims were among five members of the team who were out for a run at the time of the fatal crash, according to WTKR. The driver initially fled the scene, but was arrested a short time later after veering into a median. “We covet your prayers during this difficult time, especially for the Cramer family,” the university wrote. Milligan University is a private Christian school located near Johnson City, Tenn. About 1,300 students are currently enrolled in classes, according to the school’s website. The university suspended learning activities on Friday in wake of the tragedy.
