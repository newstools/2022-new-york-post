Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training action on Thursday: Miguel Andujar has been something of a forgotten man this spring, but he had half of the Yankees’ four hits against the Phillies, including a double to the gap. The third baseman/left fielder appears ticketed for Triple-A unless he is traded by the end of camp. After giving up two home runs last Saturday against the Blue Jays, Michael King got taken deep by Bryce Harper for a two-run shot. Still, Aaron Boone said the multi-inning reliever was “a lot crisper [with] better command,” this time around. Joely Rodriguez made his first game appearance since last Thursday, when his velocity dropped noticeably. After treating a pinched nerve in his neck, Rodriguez was back up to 92-93 mph this Thursday in a scoreless two-thirds of an inning. Gerrit Cole is scheduled to make his final Grapefruit League start in Lakeland, Fla. against the Tigers at 1:05 p.m., but iffy weather threatens to throw a wrench into those plans.
