Winning the undisputed UFC bantamweight championship ought to have felt like the professional peak for Aljamain Sterling. Having just defeated a skilled and dangerous champion in Petr Yan, Sterling should have been reveling in the moment that night at his Las Vegas house — the Long Island native  owns another home in New York — stuffed full of friends, family and other supporters. But there would be no celebrating in the hours following his March 6, 2021 triumph, not after he had become the first fighter to capture a UFC title via disqualification, the result of a brain-rattling, illegal and reckless knee delivered by Yan. “He was concussed,” Ray Longo, Sterling’s coach for a decade, recently told The Post. “When you’re concussed, you’re confused. You don’t know what the f–k’s going on. You’re crying for no reason. It was a mess.”
