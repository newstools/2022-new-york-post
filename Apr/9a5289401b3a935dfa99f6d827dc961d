“Doomsday” mom Lori Vallow posed for a new booking photo this week after being found competent to stand trial on charges she murdered her kids. The 48-year-old mom spent almost a year in a psychiatric facility in Idaho after a judge last May declared her unfit for trial and ordered an extensive psychiatric evaluation. On Monday, that same judge said Vallow was “restored to competency and is fit to proceed” to trial. She is accused of murdering her two children, Tylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua “JJ” Vallow, 7, burying them in a makeshift pet cemetery. In his order, Fremont County District Judge Steven Boyce ordered her to be remanded with the Fremont County sheriff ahead of an arraignment set for next Tuesday afternoon. Vallow was booked into Madison County Detention Center just after 1 a.m. Thursday, records show. She was charged last May with multiple counts of murder, as well as conspiring to murder one of her former husbands. JJ Vallow’s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, told KUTV that the family was “thankful for this decision.” “I’ve said it since day one, she is not incompetent,” Woodcock said of the mom, who was a member of the doomsday cult Preparing a People and who allegedly told a friend her kids were infected with evil spirits. “She knows how to play the system. She’s played it her adult life,” the grandfather said. Vallow’s latest husband, Chad Daybell, is also charged in the deaths of the children, as well as his former wife Tammy Daybell, who mysteriously died just days before he and Vallow wed. Daybell was also a member of the cult, and allegedly claimed his ex was possessed by an entity called “Voila.” He has pleaded not guilty on all counts. JJ’s grandfather told KUTV that he and his wife planned to attend the court hearings, starting with Vallow’s arraignment Tuesday and through the trial set for January. “I promise you, I will be sitting so close to them, I can iron their clothes from the back,” he said. “They’re going to get their day.”
