This Brooklyn townhouse comes with literary cred, a pretty garden featured in a glossy shelter magazine — and a hefty $4.65 million price tag. The sellers are Spy magazine co-founder and Studio 360 host Kurt Andersen and his wife, journalist/author Anne Kreamer, who bought the home for $595,000 in 1989 (about $1.3 million today). Built in 1890, the four-story, 2,944-square-foot home, at 41 2nd Place in Carroll Gardens, comes with five bedrooms, 2½ bathrooms, four fireplaces and plenty of built-in bookcases and places to write for the author of “Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America.” The home also features a front garden with cedar and kousa dogwood trees and geraniums, while a bluestone sidewalk leads to a hidden courtyard. Inside, there’s a foyer with ebony-stained wood floors, a formal dining room and lots of storage. There’s also an eat-in chef’s kitchen, walk-in pantry and laundry room. The kitchen’s rear wall of floor-to-ceiling screened doors opens to a 500-square-foot garden, featured in Domino magazine, perfect for entertaining and al fresco dining, and filled with color: hollies, hydrangeas and a redwood tree. Next up is the double-parlor floor with original plaster moldings, floor-to-ceiling casement windows, a library and two woodburning fireplaces with marble mantles. The third floor features high ceilings, cherrywood floors, casement windows, custom bookcases and two main bedrooms — one is currently used as a home office, another has a woodburning fireplace and a decorative one. Finally, the fourth floor hosts the other three bedrooms, one is currently used as a media room with a skylight and roof access. The couple are moving on up — to the Upper East Side. The listing brokers are Tita Omeze and Lisa Detwiler of Corcoran.
