Albert Pujols announced Monday that he and wife Deidre are splitting up, days after she underwent successful surgery to remove a brain tumor. “I’ve been asked a lot of questions over the past few days regarding what’s been going on at home and sadly, after 22 years of marriage, I have made the decision to file for divorce from my wife, Deidre,” Pujols said in a statement released by his agent, Dan Lozano. “I realize this is not the most opportune time with Opening Day approaching and other family events that have recently taken place. These situations are never easy and isn’t something that just happened overnight.” This offseason, Pujols signed a one-year deal to return to the Cardinals, where he previously played from 2001 to 2011. He and Deidre had been married since 2000. “As a devout Christian, this is an outcome that I never wanted to see happen,” Pujols continued in his statement. “For many long days and nights, I prayed, asking the Lord for His guidance.” Pujols concluded his statement by noting that he and Deidre “remain committed” to raising their five children “in a loving and safe environment.” “I am thankful for the five beautiful children that we brought into this world and remain committed to raising them in a loving and safe environment. I ask that you please respect our privacy and the privacy of our five children during this time.” Last season, Pujols hit .236 with 17 homers as he split time with the Dodgers and Angels.
