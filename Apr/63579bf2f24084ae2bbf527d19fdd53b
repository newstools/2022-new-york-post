A Florida man on Tuesday pleaded guilty to threatening to shoot Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar in the head in a rambling, hate-fueled email, federal authorities said. David Hannon, 67, faces up to five years in prison after copping to one count of threatening a federal official for the death threat, Department of Justice officials said. Hannon, of Sarasota, sent the vile missive to the Democratic congresswoman after she appeared at a July 2019 press conference alongside fellow progressive reps, known as “the squad,” including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The subject of the email read, “[You’re] dead, you radical Muslim,” and he referred to the other members of the squad – all lawmakers of color – as “radical rats,” the feds said. In the hate-filled screed, Hannon also asked Omar if she was prepared “to die for Islam.” Omar had appeared at the press conference after former president Donald Trump lashed out at her and members of the squad, falsely suggesting they were not citizens of the US and saying they should leave the country. A rep for Omar did not respond to request for comment about Hannon’s guilty plea. In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said the crime was offensive to American values. “Threatening to kill our elected officials, especially because of their race, ethnicity or religious beliefs, is offensive to our nation’s fundamental values,” Clarke said. “All elected officials, regardless of their background, should be able to represent their communities and serve the public free from hate-motivated threats and violence,” she added.
