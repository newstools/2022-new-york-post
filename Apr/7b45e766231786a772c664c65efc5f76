A former Camp Pendleton Marine Sgt. was sentenced to 28 years in prison for sexually molesting a 3-year-old child, according to Marine Times. Michael Hamby Jr., 31, pleaded guilty to engaging in the sexual act on the child with another male suspect. The former Marine Sgt. and his co-defendant, Elijah Alexander Vazquez, exchanged emails with each other regarding their sexual interest for children in 2016, according to The U.S. Attorney’s Office. Phone messages and email exchanges between Hamby and Vasquez persisted, ultimately, leading the two child molesters to meet up and abuse the 3-year-old. Child pornography would also be found on both Hamby and Vasqueze’s hard drives that were looked into, according to Patch.com. A former Camp Pendleton Marine, Hamby has been stationed at bases in Okinawa and California, according to documents. He joined the Marine Corps in 2009 at age 18. Hamby was also arrested in 2019, and a federal judge ordered he be held without bail.
