Aaron Judge’s Saturday got more eventful after a chaotic end to the Yankees’ afternoon win. Judge and his wife Samantha Bracksieck sat courtside at Barclays Center Saturday night for the Nets’ Game 3 loss to the Celtics, which put Boston up 3-0 in the first-round NBA playoff series. The couple, who got married in Hawaii in December, were seated next to “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah. Their night out in Brooklyn came hours after a walk-off hit by Gleyber Torres — who also attended the Nets game — which was overshadowed by a wild postgame scene in which fans seated beyond the outfield threw beers and trash at Guardians players. Judge was among the players who went out and tried to calm the fans down. Guardians right fielder Oscar Mercado said he was nearly struck by a beer can. Center fielder Myles Straw later said the Yankees fans are “the worst fan base on the planet.” The Yankees took the first two games of the series from the Guardians and have a chance to sweep them Sunday afternoon.
