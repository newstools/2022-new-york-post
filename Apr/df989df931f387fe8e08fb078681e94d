That phone’s going, going — gone. A Mets fan’s overzealous celebrations didn’t exactly sit well with a Phillies supporter this week at Citizens Bank Park, with the home fan tossing the visiting spectator’s device in the stands. In a clip that’s currently circulating on social media, the Mets fan is seen cheering in a Pete Alonso jersey, holding up his phone to apparently capture a moment from the game. As the Mets loyalist made their way up the stairs, that’s when the Phillies supporter grabbed the phone and it hurled it. Although a stadium official quickly approached the Phillies fan in question, the Mets supporter, understandably, appeared shocked as to the blink-and-you-miss series of events that transpired just moments before. The Mets ended their three-game series in Philadelphia on Wednesday, securing a 9-6 victory. They had won the night before, 2-0. The Mets will have their home opener on Friday in Flushing with an afternoon game against the Diamondbacks.
