This daytime host is moving on to more expensive California pastures. Just six months after buying a Mediterranean-style property in affluent Montecito, and a matter of weeks since purchasing a more expensive, Moorish-inspired one nearby, Ellen DeGeneres has sold this pad — and at a profit, to boot. The 64-year-old comedian and her 49-year-old wife Portia de Rossi offloaded this three-bedroom, four-bathroom, 4,780-square-foot home last month, property records reveal, according to Mansion Global. The couple got $13.9 million for the property, which they bought through a business manager-linked trust for $12 million in September. The buyer is Soren Urry, the president of commercial real estate developer Synergy Development, the outlet reported. The property features wine storage, a treatment room, a billiards area, an open format eat-in kitchen and a separate studio space that could easily be used as a guest house or a gym. The primary bedroom has a marble bathroom and an outdoor shower — and the other two bedrooms each have a wing on opposite sides of the living space. There are black casement doors and windows throughout the home, which was built in 2018. “The line between indoor and outdoor living spaces dissipates as floor-to-ceiling pocket doors fade into the walls leading to a private garden filled with fountains and lush botanicals,” advertised the listing, held by Riskin Partners Estate Group, which declined to comment for this article. The sale follows DeGeneres’ purchase of a nearly 12,000-square-foot, 2.45-acre mansion in Montecito last month. DeGeneres — whose show will end this year — shelled out close to $21 million for the estate, something of a deal considering it was asking as much as $35 million in 2019, according to reports at the time. DeGeneres and de Rossi have quite a real estate profile in the area: They also own a $14.3 million ranch as well as a small cottage in Montecito, The Post previously reported.
