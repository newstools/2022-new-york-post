No man is an island, but maybe this is the exception. A one-bedroom home completely isolated on a deserted island in Maine is up for sale for only $339,000. Located in Addison County at 0 Wohoa Bay, the property is being sold as a weekend getaway — but for serious introvert only. Known as Duck Ledges Island, the listing notes it is “offered in its entirety.” The property sits on 1.5 acres of land without any signs of civilization. “The ledges surrounding the island are loaded with seals for constant entertainment,” the listing states. “As it has no trees, it offers views of nature that you can’t find anywhere else.” The cottage, pegged as the “world’s loneliest home,” was built in 2009,  and has no neighbors, unless you count the seals. It boasts panoramic ocean views. Spanning only 540 square feet, the home does not hold a bathroom, but there is a detached port-a-potty on the island for those willing to make a midnight run. “Good anchorage and good landing points at any tide. Mooring included adjacent to the island and just a short boat ride from Jonesport public marina or Addison facility,” the listing adds. It seems however the island is having a tough time finding a buyer. It first hit the market last June — 295 days to be exact. Bold Coast Properties holds the listing.
