Johnny Depp and his bodyguard are close — but apparently not that close. As the trial against Depp’s ex-wife Amber Heard rolled on Friday, proceedings took an amusing turn when Malcolm Connolly, the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star’s security agent, was asked if he’d ever seen his employer’s penis. “I think I would remember if I’d seen Mr. Depp’s penis,” Connelly said — prompting an eruption of giggles from Depp and others in the Fairfax, Virginia, courtroom. Connelly’s quip came in response to Heard’s lawyer, who asked if the confidante could describe his anatomy — per previous testimony that the actor had been caught urinating in the foyer of the embattled ex-lovers’ home. The uncomfortable question refers to the couple’s well-reported trip to Australia in 2015 that also saw Depp’s finger severed in a heated argument, according to prior testimony, which Connelly, a former prison guard, described as “chaos.” Connelly, who addressed the court via Zoom, also characterized the pair as once “lovey-dovey” and called Heard “lovely, charming.” However, that began to change, according to Connelly, about the time of the move Down Under, attesting that Heard had called Depp a “coward” as she bandaged his finger. Depp, 58, is suing Heard, 36, with a $50 million defamation claim over a 2018 op-ed she penned about domestic violence for the Washington Post.
