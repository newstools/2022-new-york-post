Sophie Scott‘s latest post brought the heat to Instagram this week, and boyfriend Mac Jones took notice. Scott, who has been dating the Patriots quarterback since 2019, posted a photo of herself Tuesday modeling an animal print bikini designed by model Devon Windsor. Jones, 23, then double-tapped his gal pal’s snap and dropped a flirty comment. “Hot mommy!! Cutie ,” the former Alabama product responded in the comments. Jones, who wrapped his rookie season in January, has been enjoying his first NFL offseason with Scott. The couple ventured to Las Vegas for February’s Pro Bowl, but they recently vacationed in Mexico. Jones and Scott cozied up for a couple’s shot during their trip, with the latter captioning the shot, “Te amo,” or “I love you.” Since being drafted 15th overall by the Patriots last year, Jones has had Scott by his side as he began his next chapter in New England. Throughout the 2021 season, Scott has cheered on Jones both at home and on the road, including frigid Buffalo in December, when the quarterback had a three-pass performance in the Patriots’ 14-10 win over the Bills. A month later, Jones made his playoff debut against the Bills, who then demolished their division rival, 47-17. Despite the game’s final result, Scott praised Jones for a stellar rookie season and Pro Bowl nod. “Rookie year  I’m so proud of you!” Scott wrote on Instagram in January. Jones threw for 3,801 yards through 17 regular-season games, with 22 touchdowns against 13 interceptions.
