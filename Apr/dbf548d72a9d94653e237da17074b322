Russia’s foreign ministry said on Saturday that it had barred entry to the country for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defense Secretary Ben Wallace and 10 other British government members and politicians. The move was taken “in view of the unprecedented hostile action by the British Government, in particular the imposition of sanctions against senior Russian officials,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it would expand the list soon. It came at the end of a week during which Moscow warned in a formal diplomatic note to Washington warning that continued US and NATO weapons shipments to Ukraine could bring “unpredictable consequences.” The letter came as President Biden approved $800 million in new military aide for Ukraine.
