Here is a smart deal for those that want a smart home. For a limited time only, Amazon is offering an Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) device for just $0.99 with the purchase of one month of Amazon Music Unlimited. Any new Echo Dot owner can sign up, subscribing to the music and podcast streaming service for $10 per month, which is a pretty great deal once you learn what all comes with it. Aside from getting your hands on a brand new Echo Dot for under a dollar, Amazon Music Unlimited includes ad-free listening, unlimited skipping of songs, access to thousands of songs and podcasts and more. Then, add your Echo into the equation and it turns up the volume on hands-free listening. Use the Alexa assistant to play a song, adjust the volume, shuffle a playlist and more. Plus, she can also answer questions, read from your favorite news outlets, check the weather, set alarms, control your smart thermostat —the options are endless.
