It was a family affair Wednesday for Jon Rahm and Sergio Garcia, among others, who enjoyed the annual Par 3 event with loved ones ahead of the 2022 Masters. Rahm, a six-time PGA Tour winner, was spotted on the green at Augusta National with wife Kelley Cahill and their son Kepa, who was born last April. In addition to Rahm, Garcia — the winner of the 2017 Masters — was joined by wife Angela and their two children, daughter Azalea and son Enzo, as they played around on the course. The Par 3 contest takes place prior to the Masters, in which wives, girlfriends, children, and other family members of golfers can serve as their caddies. Wednesday’s outing marked the first Par 3 event since 2019, as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the past two years. Collin Morikawa was also joined by fiancée Katherine Zhu, with the duo encountering a potential future Masters winner on the course in the way of Mackenzie Hughes’ youngest son. Elsewhere, Brooks Koepka toured Augusta National with his future wife, actress and philanthropist Jena Sims, who appeared to sport new kicks from her Steve Madden collection. The Masters gets underway Thursday, with all eyes on five-time champion Tiger Woods, who is returning to the course just 14 months after a horrific car wreck. Woods last won the Masters in 2019.
