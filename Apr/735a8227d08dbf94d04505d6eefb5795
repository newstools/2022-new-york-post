Peyton Manning’s Omaha Productions continues to add real estate across ESPN’s properties. The Post has learned that the companies are collaborating on a project with Vince Carter, called “Vince’s Places”, for a procession of visits with NBA legends that will track with the rest of the programs in the “Places” series. The show launches Wednesday at noon ET on ESPN+, the network’s streaming service. The first episode will include Carter and Manning’s exploration back to 1891 for the advent of the sport, and also feature spots with Alonzo Mourning and WWE superstar Titus O’Neil. Guests later in the season include Jerry West, Patrick Ewing, Julius Erving, Mark Cuban, Ray Allen, Dominique Wilkins, Dikembe Mutombo, Dirk Nowitzki, Gary Payton, Chris Mullin and more. Carter, one of the most prolific dunkers and athletic players in NBA history, entered the league in 1998 and retired after the 2019-20 season. He made eight All-Star teams. Other programs in the series include “Peyton’s Places” with Peyton Manning, “Eli’s Places” with Eli Manning, “Abby’s Places” with Abby Wambach, “Rowdy’s Places” with Ronda Rousey and “Big Papi’s Places” with David Ortiz. “Peyton and Eli” with the Manning brothers, the popular “Monday Night Football” sidecast, is another major spoke in the Omaha Productions / ESPN umbrella.
