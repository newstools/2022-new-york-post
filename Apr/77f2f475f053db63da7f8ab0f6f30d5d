Video captures the moment a shooter opened fire from a stolen car in the Bronx this week – striking a man in the leg in broad daylight. The footage, released early Wednesday, shows a gray car pulling up at the intersection of East 183rd Street and Crotona Avenue in Belmont at 11:20 a.m. Tuesday – just after the victim, a 20-year-old man, crossed the street with a woman. A person then reached out the car window and let off two rounds, striking the man once in the left leg, cops said. The victim was taken to Mount Sinai Morningside, where he was listed in stable condition, police said. It was unclear Wednesday whether he was the intended target. The investigation revealed that the car, a 2018 Honda Accord with NY registration #KSE-3564, was stolen from Eighth Avenue near West 38th Street in Manhattan minutes before 1 a.m. that day, authorities said. The driver, a 25-year-old man, reported that he had left it running and unattended while he picked up food, cops said. When he returned, it was gone. No arrests had been made by Wednesday.
