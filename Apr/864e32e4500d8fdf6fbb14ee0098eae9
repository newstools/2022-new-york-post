President Biden plans to tap Bridget Brink to serve as the US ambassador to Ukraine, two months after Russia launched its brutal invasion of the nation, the White House announced Monday. Brink, a veteran and US diplomat, currently serves as the ambassador to the Slovak Republic and has a long history of working in European and Eurasian Affairs. Her nomination was first indicated by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin over the weekend in a secretive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. If confirmed, Brink would be the first ambassador to Ukraine since Marie Yovanovitch was removed by former President Donald Trump in 2019. She has served in various positions with the US State Department including working as the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs as well as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassies in Uzbekistan and Georgia. Brink, who hails from Michigan, holds Master’s degrees in International Relations and Political Theory from the London School of Economics and Political Science. She obtained her Bachelor’s degree from Kenyon College. Brink was reportedly Biden’s pick in January, ahead of the Feb. 24 invasion, however, the administration was waiting on Ukraine’s approval of his pick, according to CNN. The nomination comes as the Administration expects to start the return of American diplomats to Ukraine this week. “The increased U.S. presence demonstrates our support for Ukraine and is part of the U.S. commitment to return our diplomats to our Embassy in Kyiv as soon as possible. This action will strengthen the Department’s ongoing commitment to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts and the delivery of assistance to the Government of Ukraine, while providing enhanced support to U.S. citizens,” the State Department said in a statement.
