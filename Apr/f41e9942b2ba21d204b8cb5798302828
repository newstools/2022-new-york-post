We have a seesaw battle in New York sports talk radio afternoon drive. After losing the fall quarter to ESPN’s “The Michael Kay Show” with Kay, Peter Rosenberg and Don La Greca, WFAN’s “Carton & Roberts” with Craig Carton and Evan Roberts has won the winter book of the January to March quarter. From 3:00 to 6:30 p.m., the time period when both shows overlap, ESPN got a 4.5 percent audience share and WFAN 5.7 percent among men 25-54, the demographic for which sports talk radio advertisers target. ESPN finished seventh in the market in this time slot, while WFAN finished with a tie for second. These numbers are measured by Nielsen, and include both terrestrial radio and streaming. This result is not altogether surprising, as WFAN won the battle for the first two months of the book. For the rest of the day, WFAN beat ESPN by an even bigger margin. Most notably, “Boomer and Gio” with Boomer Esiason and Gregg Giannotti finished first in the market with a 10.8 percent share. During that 6:00-10:00 p.m. time slot, ESPN New York airs “DiPietro & Rothenberg” with Rick DiPietro and Dave Rothenberg for the first two hours and “Keyshawn, JWill & Max” with Keyshawn Johnson, Jay Williams and Max Kellerman for the final two. ESPN got a 2.1-percent share and is tied for 17th in the market during that period. The numbers are better for ESPN if you just count from 5:00-8:00 am, when it is all local with “DiPietro & Rothenberg.” For the duration of their show, they have a 2.9-percent share and are in a tie for 10th in the market. WFAN is owned by Audacy and ESPN New York by Good Karma Brands.
