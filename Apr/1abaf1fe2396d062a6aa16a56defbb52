“Plaza Suite” star Sarah Jessica Parker has tested positive for COVID just days after her husband and co-star, Matthew Broderick. The Broadway show’s Instagram account said Thursday afternoon that the night’s performance would be canceled. “Today Sarah Jessica Parker tested positive for COVID with a second test confirming the diagnosis,” the social media statement said of the 57-year-old actress. “With both Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker positive for COVID, tonight’s performance of ‘Plaza Suite’ is canceled. The producers apologize for the inconvenience this has caused audience members.” There was no word on how long the shutdown would last. The announcement included instructions for ticket-holders affected by the show’s pause. “News about future performances of #PlazaSuite will be announced as soon as possible,” the statement continued. “Everyone wishes Matthew and Sarah Jessica a speedy recovery.” Broderick, 60, tested positive for the coronavirus and was forced to pull out of Tuesday’s show just hours before he was set to perform in “Plaza Suite” — which opened March 28 at Hudson Theatre. In the three-act show, the married co-stars play a trio of couples all staying in Suite 719 of the Plaza at various times.
