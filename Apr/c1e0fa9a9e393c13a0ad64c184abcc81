A troubled mother dropped her 6-month-old son from the second-floor balcony of the family’s Brooklyn apartment on Thursday morning, police said. The infant was critically injured from the fall and investigators later Thursday were questioning his parents over the disturbing incident that took place before 5 a.m. at 1870 51st Street in Mapleton, the NYPD said. The woman’s husband told police he was sleeping when his wife woke him up to say she had dropped their child from the balcony, authorities said. The baby was taken to Maimonides Medical Center in critical but stable condition. There was no word on any arrests by Thursday evening.
