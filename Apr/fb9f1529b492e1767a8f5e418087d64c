A Las Vegas woman was arrested on Wednesday after she allegedly attempted to smother her “evil” newborn on the way to the hospital. Ashley Hollingsworth faces one charge of attempted murder and child abuse, according to Las Vegas police. The 22-year-old had given a home birth on Saturday and was en route to MountainView Hospital when she wrapped a blanket around the newborn’s head, according to KLAS. She allegedly compressed the blanket against the child’s nose and face. Upon arrival at the hospital, Hollingsworth refused to enter the emergency room because she was “bleeding profusely.” Hollingsworth fled from the area near the hospital and was found about two hours later with injuries to her head. She told police she was “beat up by a rock,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Hollingsworth’s injuries are reflected in her booking photo, which showed the woman with two, large black eyes. She allegedly told police there was “something evil” in her stomach and was trying to kill it. The baby’s father, who traveled with Hollingsworth, brought the baby to the hospital staff for treatment. According to authorities, MountainView doctors initially believed the baby suffered a brain bleed. However, the diagnosis showed the baby didn’t sustain any injuries from the horrifying incident. Hollingsworth is set to appear in court on Monday.
