A 10-year-old girl was found dead near a walking trail in Wisconsin one day after she went missing while visiting family nearby, cops said. Lily Peters was discovered Monday morning in a wooded area near a brewery parking lot not far from her aunt’s home in Chippewa Falls, according to police. “The Chippewa County Coroner’s Office has now confirmed that this is the body of Iliana Peters,” Chippewa Falls Police Chief Matthew Kelm said at a press conference. “At this point, we are considering this a homicide investigation.” Lily, a fourth-grader at Parkview Elementary School, had gone missing on Sunday. Her father reported her absence to police at 9 p.m. Police deployed canine teams and the girl’s bike was later found near the walking trail. She lives about four blocks away from her aunt’s home. Chippewa Falls police were hunting for her killer Monday night. Chief Kelm told residents to “maintain a state of vigilance as there may be a danger to the public.”
