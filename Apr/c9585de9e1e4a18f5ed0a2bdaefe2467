A perv forced a woman out of a Queens subway station and then attempted to sexually assault her inside a building lobby in broad daylight, authorities said Tuesday. The 22-year-old victim was inside the Main Street station in Flushing around 9:45 a.m. Thursday when the creep went up to her, grabbed her by the arm and forced her to walk upstairs and out of the station, police said. He then forced her to walk with him down Main Street toward Kissena Boulevard, and brought her into the lobby of a building, cops said. There, he “forcibly restrained” the victim and exposed his penis, police said. The brave victim managed to break free and ran off to report the incident, cops said. The victim did not report any injuries and refused medical attention. The suspect – shown in surveillance footage released by the NYPD – fled the scene. He is described as about 30-years-old and 5-foot-7, weighing 160 pounds, with a dark complexion, medium build, long black hair, brown eyes and facial hair. He was last seen wearing a blue baseball hat, a white facemask, a dark-colored T-shirt with “Aeropostale New York” written on the front, dark-colored pants, black shoes and carrying a white bag.
