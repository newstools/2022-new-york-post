What you see depends on how satisfied you are in your life. So what do you see when you look at this optical illusion? The clever image was shared on TikTok by the Bright Side channel, with a voiceover explaining that some people see an apple core, while others see the profiles of two people. “If it’s an apple to you, you take things for what they are and are pretty happy with what you have in life,” they said. “You know that you can always rely on your close people and they’ll support you no matter what. “You’re always in a good mood and pass it on to others.” But if you saw the profiles first, then relationships are your biggest priority. “You might be going through a time of uncertainty with someone special to you,” they continued. “Remember, the best you can do is discuss it together and not hold it all in your heart. “Things will surely get better.” People in the comments section on the video were largely divided as to what they’d seen first, with some insisting they’d spotted the eaten apple, while the profiles jumped out to others. The illusion is a version of the famous Rubin’s Vase illusion, which Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin developed in approximately 1915. In his illusion, the center image is a vase rather than an apple core, while there are two profiles on each side. This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
