Christina Haack is ready to expand her living space with husband Joshua Hall. Newly married, the HGTV star has sold her oceanfront California home for $11.5 million —  less than one year after buying the property, The Post can reveal. Haack, 38, initially purchased the estate in Orange County’s Dana Point last July for $10.3 million. Norm Christensen, the driving force behind the company AAE Aerospace, purchased the home from Haack, according to the deed obtained by The Post. The deed was signed on March 30, and the sale closed on April 8. It comes also a month after Haack and her ex, Tarek El Moussa, announced they were ending their long-running series “Flip or Flop.” Sources told The Post at the time, El Moussa’s new marriage “complicated things.” Spanning more than 6,000 square feet, Haack regularly took to social media to post inside the five-bedroom, 6.5-bathroom residence. Interior amenities include an office with a coffered ceiling, a carpeted dual-level movie theater and a billiards room. The quarter-acre lot overlooks the Pacific Ocean and offers a pool, a hot tub, a fire pit, and outdoor seating and dining areas. The rooftop deck has a large fireplace, and additional seating and dining areas. The chef’s kitchen features granite counters, two islands, self-closing cabinets and drawers, a butler’s pantry and a windowed breakfast nook with peaked cathedral ceilings. The home never actually hit the market and the transaction happened in an off-market deal. But it looks like Haack is walking with a profit and scored her asking price. No word yet on where her new pad is, but it is expected to be another oceanfront residence with more square footage, a source told The Post. Haack secretly married Hall, 41, a fellow real estate agent, within the past few months, Page Six confirmed.
