The state Cannabis Control Board is issuing the first licenses to 52 local farmers to grow marijuana for adult recreational use — a major step in launching the seed to sale industry in the Empire State. The cannabis grown by farmers or “cultivators” awarded licenses Thursday will feed the first products sold at legal cannabis retail stores later this year, according to the board. The board has drafted a resolution to grant the “conditional adult-use cultivator” licenses during a scheduled 1 p.m. meeting. “The Board desires to issue a license to every applicant that has received the Chairperson’s preliminary determination to grant a  license,” the draft resolution says. New York State recently launched its first “Cannabis Conversation” public service ads in anticipation of legally selling marijuana, which includes the warning: “Don’t drive high.” A customer must be 21 or over to buy and use cannabis. The ads also advise tokers to be respectful by smoking pungent weed “away from other people” and to store the stash safely away from children. The legislature and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the law legalizing the recreational use of cannabis last spring. Gov. Kathy Hochul has moved to speed up the development of the cannabis market after a slow rollout under her predecessor. The cannabis board also has agreed to award the  first retail licenses to sell weed to people with a history of marijuana convictions.
