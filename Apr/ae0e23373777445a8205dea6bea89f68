You know that glammed-up girl you know from our social media pages? Well we hate to break it to you — but we look like that approximately one per cent of the time. Just because that selfie looked completely spontaneous, behind-the-scenes it took about 100 takes and solid half-an-hour of applying makeup to achieve. One person who knows a little something about this is TikTok user Alyssa Segrist. Earlier this year, the social media star — who boasts 345,000 followers — shared a video documenting her extreme makeover. Miming along to the lyrics of Kelis’ “Milkshake,” the viral clip opens with Alyssa showing what she looks like without any makeup on. In the opening 10 seconds, the TikToker isn’t wearing her false teeth or pencilled in her eyebrows yet. Shocking viewers with her epic “glow-up”, Alyssa then cuts to a clip where she’s fully dolled-up for the day. Along with her beautiful Hollywood smile, the star had thin dark brows and an impressive cat-eye liquid eyeliner flick too.  She jokingly captioned the clip: “Milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.” Unsurprisingly, viewers were wowed by the “Catfish” transformation. “You are beautiful human being,” one gushed. “Love the video,” another added. “Looks marvellous.” “I’m here for it,” a third replied. A fourth said: “Remind me somehow about the Queen in Alice in the Wonderland!” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
