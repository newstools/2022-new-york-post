Tyreek Hill has been one of the Chiefs’ biggest weapons. However, quarterback Patrick Mahomes is anything but shocked that Hill won’t be returning next season. In a recent interview with Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Mahomes opened up about the 28-year-old’s trade to the Dolphins. Mahomes discussed how the front office kept him in the loop for all major changes, including when Hill was able to pursue a trade. While expected, the 26-year-old quarterback was still surprised when a trade was actually finalized in March. “It more surprised me whenever it got to the point where we were really considering trading him,” Mahomes said “They kept me updated the entire time; I knew the extension talks were going on. And then I knew when he got the permission to seek to get traded. But I mean, still, I played my entire career with Tyreek, so definitely, there was a little bit of shock when he got traded. “At the same time, they kept me involved the entire process, and I know that we made a tremendous effort to try to keep him in Kansas City. Tyreek, he’s such a tremendous player, he got what he deserved. I’m happy for him. And he’s at a place where he has a home and he’s closer to family and stuff. So I’m very happy for him. We had to move forward.” Now that the wide receiver will be taking his talents farther south, Mahomes has changed his focus to making sure that the Chiefs are stacking up on high-quality receivers to replace Hill with the now-open cap space. “We had to move on and try to get as much as we could for him and try to build that receiving room again,” Mahomes said. “And do it to where we have the ability to go out there and compete every single week, which I trust Brett Veach and Coach [Andy] Reid will do.”
