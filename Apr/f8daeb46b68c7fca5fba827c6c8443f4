Joel Embiid wasn’t rapping “Take Care” to Drake after he hit the game-winner in Philadelphia’s 104-101 overtime victory Wednesday in Game 3 against the Raptors. Instead, the Sixers center was talking trash to Toronto’s celebrity ambassador and warned: “Get your ass out. I’m coming for the sweep, too.” The now-viral exchange occurred when Embiid ran into Drake on the court at Scotiabank Centre as he was making his way back to the locker room. Warning: Graphic language “You better be there,” Embiid told Drake, referring to Game 4, which is set for Saturday at 2 p.m. in Toronto. “I’ll be there, what do you mean?” Drake replied, laughing. “I’ll be there for that 3-1.” The 35-year-old rapper was later photographed smiling behind Embiid, 28, as he exited the arena. Embiid’s teammate, Sixers forward Tobias Harris, later shared some insight about the trash talk that went on during the nail-biting matchup. “In the first half, Drake was over there saying, ‘He can’t play here!’ That’s what he was saying,” Harris said in a post-game press conference. “I said, ‘He can play here, for sure.’ He was like, ‘Nah, he can’t play here.'” Embiid, who’s been favored to win this season’s NBA MVP award, has been brilliant for Philadelphia to start the postseason. He finished Wednesday’s win with 33 points and 13 rebounds in 44 minutes of action. The Sixers are just one win away from sweeping the Raptors in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoff series. While it’s likely Drake will be sitting courtside for Game 4 on Saturday, it remains to be seen if Embiid will be packing a broom.
