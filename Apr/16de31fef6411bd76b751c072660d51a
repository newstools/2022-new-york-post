The latest Harry Potter spinoff cast a spell on the domestic box office on its opening night. “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” grossed $20.1 million on April 15, its opening night, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo database. Warner Bros. cut out references to a gay affair in the movie for its release in China, with a rep saying the “nuanced cuts” were made to “respond sensitively” to China’s market. “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” followed on Friday, grossing $10.9 million that day and $100.5 million cumulatively. Action-adventure flick “The Lost City” came in third, with $2.1 million Friday and $74.1 million cumulatively.
