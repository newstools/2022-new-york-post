Date night in the desert. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and wife Brittany Matthews hit up Coachella on Sunday in Indio, Calif. where the newlyweds attended Revolve Festival. Matthews took to Instagram to share her festival looks, including a sweet snap with Mahomes. The KC Current owner and fitness professional shared a selfie with the Super Bowl champion sporting colorful sunglasses, and other videos partying with friends at the festival. Mr. and Mrs. Mahomes were without their daughter Sterling, who turned 1 in February. On Sunday, the couple shared family photos celebrating Easter. Mahomes married Matthews in a sunset ceremony in Maui last month, where his brother Jackson Mahomes served as the best man, and his Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce was a groomsman. Kelce’s girlfriend, model Kayla Nicole — who also at Coachella over the weekend — was a bridesmaid. Earlier this month, Matthews explained during a Q&A on Instagram, that she and Mahomes chose to marry in Maui because it was their first vacation destination together. Matthews added, “The weather and views are just perfection there! I wanted somewhere where people couldn’t just pull up to lol.”
