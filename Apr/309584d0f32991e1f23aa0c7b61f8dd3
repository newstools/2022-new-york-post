WASHINGTON — Another game, another Mets batter plunked, another dose of retaliation by victory. The Mets beat the Nationals for the third straight game Saturday, and did it for once without seeing one of their stars lying in the dirt after taking a baseball to the mouth. That’s what happened the previous two days when Pete Alonso was left with swollen lips and a bloodied mouth in the opener, and again when Francisco Lindor needed X-rays and a concussion test in the second game of the season. “This has been a high-octane series,” Alonso said after hitting a grand slam in Saturday’s 5-0 win. “A lot of emotions.” Starling Marte became the fifth Mets batter drilled over three games when he took a slow curveball off the side. Home plate umpire Jordan Baker jumped to Marte’s hip, before Marte’s pacing around the dirt sparked a second benches- and bullpens-clearing incident in as many days. “It’s not intentional,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said of the latest hit batsman. “But it still doesn’t make you happy. I don’t care how hard it is, it hurts. It gets your attention.”
