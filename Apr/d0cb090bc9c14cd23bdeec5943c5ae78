Chilling surveillance footage emerged Wednesday that showed Brooklyn subway shooting suspect Frank James allegedly en route to carry out the attack that left 29 innocent New Yorkers injured. The videos show James — wearing an orange reflective vest and hard hat — walking down Kings Highway in Gravesend early Tuesday after parking his U-Haul three blocks away, police said. James could be seen wheeling a black cart in his left hand, while carrying a black backpack in the other. Police said he then entered the Kings Highway subway station, which services the N line, where the 62-year-old was captured on surveillance cameras going through the turnstiles. The videos of James walking down the street are believed to have been taken around 6 a.m. — two hours before he allegedly unleashed terror on the Manhattan-bound N train. It wasn’t immediately clear what time James entered the station or what he did in the hours before he allegedly set off a gas cylinder and fired 33 shots at innocent passengers as the train pulled into the 36th Street station in Sunset Park just before 8:30 a.m. Cops said they recovered James’ black cart abandoned on the train in the wake of the attack. They also found his vest and helmet stashed in a subway trash can. After opening fire, police said, James boarded an R train on the opposite platform and fled alongside terrified straphangers. He was caught on surveillance cameras getting off the train at the 25th Street stop and fleeing, police said. James was eventually arrested Wednesday afternoon in the East Village over the attack that left 10 commuters shot and at least 19 others injured.
