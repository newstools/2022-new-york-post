DK Metcalf is praising former teammate Russell Wilson following recent criticism over the quarterback’s relationship with wife Ciara. The Seahawks receiver, who played with Wilson for three seasons, responded to a tweet Tuesday that admiringly referred to the  33-year-old quarterback as “corny,” according to SideAction.com. “Great Man, Great Father, Great Husband,” Metcalf, 24, responded to a tweet that included a photo of Wilson and Ciara, along with the message, “Sign me up for ‘corny.'” Metcalf’s defense of his one-time quarterback comes days after Channing Crowder, a former Dolphins linebacker, offered a biting take on Wilson and Ciara’s union of nearly six years. “If Russell didn’t have that bread Ciara wouldn’t be with him,” Crowder said on “The Pivot” podcast. “Ciara, she has a good situation. “You don’t leave Future and get with Russell Wilson. It’s a type. Everybody has a type… and I love him on the field but he’s f—king square.” Prior to her relationship with Wilson, Ciara was engaged to rapper Future, with whom she shares son Future Zahir, 7. The two split in 2014 and she began dating Wilson, who proposed in 2016. Wilson and Ciara have two children together: daughter Sienna Princess, 4, and son Win Harrison, 1. Despite the outside noise, Wilson and Ciara remained focused on their next chapter as a family. Last month, the Super Bowl-winning quarterback was traded to the Broncos after spending the first 10 seasons of his career with the Seahawks. Metcalf, meanwhile, has been the recent subject of trade rumors as Seattle readies to rebuild. He was the Seahawks’ 64th overall pick in the 2019 draft.
