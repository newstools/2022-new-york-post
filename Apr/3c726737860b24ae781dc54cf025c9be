Last night, the local teams each found reasons to believe that turnarounds are near. In an NFL Draft defined by defense — the top five picks were defensive players for just the second time in history (1991) — the Jets and Giants sparked optimism with their respective pair of top-10 picks. The Jets made their biggest moves on the outside, taking Cincinnati cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner with the fourth overall pick and Ohio State receiver Garrett Wilson with the 10th pick, before trading up to select Florida State defensive end Jermaine Johnson II with the 26th pick.
