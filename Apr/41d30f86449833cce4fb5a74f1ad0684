Bronx-born fashion industry icon Rose Marie Bravo, known for transforming Burberry and serving as the first female president of Saks Fifth Avenue, has sold part of the 15-acre Long Island waterfront estate she owns with her husband William Jackey. It had been on the market for $7.25 million. The property includes two homes, Casa Brava and the Lodge on Tuthill Cove, and both come with pools and docks — with 850 feet on the water and lots of themed international gardens — with sculptures, waterfalls and koi ponds in East Moriches, NY. Soaring prices in the Hamptons have pushed buyers “up island” to waterfront areas like the Moriches, Bellport — where editrix Anna Wintour has a home — and Mastic, brokers say. The listings are at 116 and 122 Atlantic Ave. For now, the main house, Casa Brava, at 116 Atlantic Ave., will stay in the family. That home features four bedrooms and four bathrooms — all on just under six acres. But the Lodge on Tuthill Cove — at 122 Atlantic Ave. — also features a four-bedroom, three-bathroom home, with 150 feet on the water that sits on 3.8 acres. It just sold for $2.1 million. The lodge, Bravo says, was once a hotel and, later, a retreat for nuns. But most recently it served as their guesthouse. In addition, 5.5 acres were sold to the Town of Brookhaven, which paid $5.9 million for preservation. The listing brokers were Brenda Giufurta and Joseph Savio of Douglas Elliman.
