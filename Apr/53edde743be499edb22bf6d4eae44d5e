One year down and forever to go for Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and his wife, Marissa. The couple recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary with a romantic getaway, where they soaked up the sun on the beach and even played with pigs. “Paradise on earth,” Marissa captioned an Instagram gallery on Saturday. In separate photos shared on Marissa’s Instagram Story, the couple is seen cozying up for a sunset snapshot. “I just really love you,” Marissa said of Lawrence, 22, later quipping, “love a good self timer.” The Lawrences became husband and wife last April, weeks before the former Clemson product was selected first overall in the 2021 NFL Draft. On Sunday, Marissa commemorated the pair’s actual anniversary with a heartfelt Instagram tribute. “Trevor, you are my home. I’ve never fully understood the depth this word holds until now. I am in awe of the way you love me. The way you always fight for our marriage and the way you always make me feel seen, heard and valued. You are my very best friend and I can’t thank God enough for the gift you are. The love of my life. Happy anniversary, here’s to a lifetime of loving you & always choosing to see the gift that it is,” she gushed. Lawrence, meanwhile, wrote a touching message of his own to Marissa, whom he got engaged to in July 2020. “There’s a lot of things that I could say, but sometimes less is more. You are my best friend and my biggest supporter. You make me better and life is so much more full with you. I love you more everyday,” the quarterback penned Sunday. Lawrence is gearing up for his sophomore season in Jacksonville, which will be his first under new head coach Doug Pederson. Urban Meyer served as Lawrence’s coach for most of his rookie season but was fired in December amid a myriad of on-and-off-field debacles.
