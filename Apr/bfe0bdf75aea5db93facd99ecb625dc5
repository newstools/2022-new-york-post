America might run on Dunkin’ but a New Jersey man and his wife are racing to court after he was allegedly burned by a hot cup of coffee from the java joint. Evan Arlington and Stephanie Arlington-Macias bought two cups of coffee and an iced coffee from a Totowa Dunkin’ Donuts on Aug. 25, 2021, according to an April 4 lawsuit they filed in Passaic County. Arlington suffered second- and third-degree burns after the coffee spilled in his lap at the drive-thru, said the couple’s attorney, William Gold. Arlington had medical bills, while Arlington-Macias, 37, suffered “a loss of her husband’s aid, comfort, conjugal fellowship and consortium,” they claim in the legal filing. The pair are seeking unspecified damages.  Dunkin’ Donuts didn’t return a message. Scalding hot coffee first brought major headlines in 1992, when then 79-year-old Stella Liebeck won $2.7 million from McDonald’s after suffering third-degree burns from a scorching hot beverage spilled in her lap.
