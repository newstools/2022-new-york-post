Two-time NBA champion J.R. Smith has transitioned from the court to the golf course and classroom effortlessly. The former sixth man of the year was named North Carolina A&T’s Academic Athlete of the Year with a 4.0 GPA on Monday. Smith, 36, enrolled at North Carolina A&T on Aug. 11, pursuing a degree in liberal studies with the intention of joining the golf team while awaiting a decision from the NCAA regarding his eligibility. On Aug. 24, just a day after starting classes, he was cleared to play golf for the Aggies. Smith, who originally committed to North Carolina to play basketball, ended up getting drafted straight out of high school as the No. 18 pick by the New Orleans Hornets in the 2004 NBA Draft. LeBron James, who won an NBA championship with Smith in Cleveland, congratulated his former teammate. “YESSIR @TheRealJRSmith!! Proud of you Kid!!! Love bro,” James tweeted. Smith played four of his 16 NBA seasons with the Knicks.
