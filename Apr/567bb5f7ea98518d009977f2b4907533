Jermaine Johnson II is happy to be a Jet. After New York selected the top edge rusher out of Florida State with the No. 26 pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Johnson made a bee line to the Las Vegas crowd and his new cheering section. Johnson was immediately embraced by a sea of roaring fans dressed in green and joined on a proud “J.E.T.S” chant. The Jets took the 23-year-old defensive end after trading back into the first round to select him at No. 26 overall Thursday night. Johnson was projected as a top-10 pick, but slipped down the board, and the Jets made a play to fill their 16-year edge rusher drought. The team tweeted the video of Johnson and their fans, writing, “Things we love to see.” Johnson went on to post a number of excited tweets after he got the call from the Jets. “Let’s get those wheels up and #TakeFlight,” he tweeted. “Hype to touch down in NY and hit the ground running.” Johnson turned heads on the red carpet in a black and yellow patterned suit. He wore tinted sunglasses and accessorized with a diamond jewelry. “My designer Tom from Gentleman’s Playbook, he sent me over a bunch of patterns and I’m looking, I’m looking, I’m looking and I can’t take my eyes off this pattern and I was like, ‘We need this one,'” Johnson said about his red carpet look. He wore patches inside his suit jacket to symbolize his journey from high school to junior college to Georgia and finally Florida State.
