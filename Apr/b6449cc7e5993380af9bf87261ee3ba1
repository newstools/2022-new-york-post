The Rangers officially agreed to terms with Bobby Trivigno on Friday after eying the college free-agent standout for some time. Trivigno traveled to Hartford on Friday and is hopeful to play for the Wolf Pack on Saturday. Trivigno will reunite with former UMass teammate Zac Jones in Hartford. The East Setauket, NY, native will be on an amateur tryout contract for the remainder of 2021-22 before his two-year, $1.665 million deal — which includes a $92,500 signing bonus — kicks in next season. In four years at UMass, Trivigno was at the heart of the hockey program’s transformation into a powerhouse. He was named the Most Outstanding Player in the Minutemen’s first national championship and guided the team to back-to-back Hockey East titles. In addition to serving as captain his senior year, Trivigno finished his collegiate career with 53 goals and 78 assists with a plus-73 rating in 139 games. The 23-year-old was named this season’s Hockey East Player of the Year, as well as a Hobey Baker Award Top 10 finalist. Trivigno also became just the fourth player to win the Walt Brown Award, given annually to the top American-Born Division I college hockey player in New England, in back-to-back seasons.
