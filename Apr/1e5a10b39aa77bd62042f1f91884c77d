Disturbing video shows a group brutally kicking, stabbing and whipping a man with a belt during a brawl outside a Queens club. The footage, released Thursday night, captures the fracas that unfolded around 3:45 a.m. April 17 in front of El Pasillo, a nightclub on 103rd Street near 39th Avenue in North Corona, cops said. The attackers got into a dispute with club security,  and a 46-year-old male bystander then tried to intervene, police said. Two men in the group kicked the bystander, another suspect stabbed him three times on the ground, and a fourth man struck him with a belt, according to the footage. At some point, bouncer Pedro Delacruz, 22, let off a gunshot in an attempt to disperse the group, according to police. He was arrested April 22 and charged with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment, cops said. Cops are still looking for the four attackers. The bystander who was beaten was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he was initially listed in critical condition but has since stabilized, police said.
