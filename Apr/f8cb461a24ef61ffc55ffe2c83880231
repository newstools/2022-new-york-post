Not much about the Queen’s life is normal — from living in a palace to having a glittering display of jewels — and she even eats bananas in an unusual way too. In Darren McGrady’s book Eating Royally, he explains that the Queen would cut the top and bottom off of a banana and eat it with a knife and fork. She’d then chop it up into small pieces so there was no biting “like a monkey”. Etiquette expert William Hanson demonstrated the exact method the Queen uses to consume her bananas. He said: “This is how the Queen would eat a banana. “We don’t peel it like a primate. “Instead, using a fork we hold it in place and then we cut off one end, then we cut off the other end. “Then we turn the knife on its side and go into the skin like so, and then prising it open… “And then cut a little bit off and eat like so.” Many people were baffled by the method, with one person saying: “My life is already complicated. I can’t deal with another stress.” Another said: “you are making it harder.. Life is already hard my goodness.” And that isn’t Her Majesty’s only bizarre food quirk. She’s also banned pasta and potatoes and shellfish is a no-go due to its risk of causing food poisoning. She disliked starchy foods and modified out-of-season vegetables, preferring low-fat dishes such as chicken and grilled fish. And kindly, she took her public into consideration while lunching before a royal engagement. As she has to meet people so often, garlic and onion were kept to a minimum. Darren added: “We could never serve garlic to the Queen but Prince Philip loved it. If we were at Balmoral and she was out, we’d slather his steak in garlic. “But when she was at the table, there was no garlic at all. It was seen as anti-social.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
