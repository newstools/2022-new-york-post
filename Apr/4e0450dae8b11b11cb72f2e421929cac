A local coroner in Georgia discovered the bodies of his parents and 19-year-old son, who were killed during a robbery at a gun range last week, authorities have revealed. Coweta County Coroner Richard Hawk made the grim discovery after stopping by his parents’ shooting range, Lock Stock & Barrel, in Grantville on Friday night. He found the bodies of his parents, Thomas and Evelyn Hawk, both 75, and his 19-year-old son, Luke, inside, police said. “Tommy, Evelyn and Luke knew the Lord as their personal savior,” a sobbing Hawk told the Guardian on Sunday. “They died knowing the Lord, and they’re in heaven. “If anyone is out there who doesn’t know [the Lord], they need to — time is short.” Investigators believe the deadly robbery unfolded around 5:30 p.m. Friday — around the time the range usually closes. As many as 40 guns, as well as the range’s surveillance cameras, were stolen, according to authorities. Hawk’s parents had operated the gun range for more than 30 years and his teen son was there helping them while he was on spring break, Grantville Police Chief Steve Whitlock said. The Hawk family was well-known and well-respected in their small community, Whitlock added. “This is just a shock to everybody in the community. We’re trying to do the best that we can to figure this out,” Whitlock said. “We’re just a small town, 12 officers. I’ve been here eight years and have never had to investigate anything like this. It’s been kind of hard on us. The crime rate is really, really low.” The Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting local cops with the investigation. Authorities have yet to identify any suspects. A reward of $15,000 has been posted for information leading to arrests and convictions in the case.
