Ukrainian refugees are camping at the US border and their numbers have swelled since the war in Ukraine began. Hundreds of Ukrainians have now found themselves in the border town of Tijuana, seeking asylum in the United States. Around 600 are camped along the border, while another 500 are holed up in hotels in the city, according to Enrique Lucero, Tijuana’s migration affairs director. About 40% of those who have arrived are children. “I couldn’t cry in Ukraine. I thank you even for my tears,”  Valentina Shymanveska, a native of war-ravaged Kharkiv, said. “For this place, this food, and the dream of life until [Ukraine’s] victory.” The Russian invasion has sparked the greatest European refugee crisis since World War II, with millions of Ukrainians now displaced from their homes. President Biden has promised to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. With Post wires.
