At least nine people were wounded in a shooting at a restaurant in South Carolina on Sunday — the second mass shooting in the Palmetto State in as many days. The shooting occurred Sunday morning at Cara’s Lounge Furman in rural Hampton County, about 50 miles northwest of Savannah, according to the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, WTLX reported. No deaths have been reported at this time, cops confirmed. It’s not immediately clear what led to the shooting. Law enforcement has not released any further information. The shooting is the second mass shooting over Easter Weekend. On Saturday, 14 people were injured after two shooters opened fire at the Columbiana Centre mall in Columbia. Nine people were shot and five others were injured in the ensuing panic as shoppers fled for their lives. The injured ranged in age from 15 to 73 years old. On Sunday, Columbia Police Department announced they had arrested Jewayne M. Price — a 22-year-old who was one of three people initially detained by law enforcement. He was charged with the unlawful carrying of a pistol, however, more charges may be pending as the investigation continues, the department added in a press release. Investigators called the mall shooting an “isolated incident” prompted by an unspecified “ongoing conflict” between two shooters.
