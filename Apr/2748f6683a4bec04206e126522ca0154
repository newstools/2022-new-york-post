Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Mets’ spring training action on Thursday: Third baseman Eduardo Escobar crushed his second homer of the spring, off a hanging changeup from Josh Rogers, in the Mets’ 7-3 loss to the Nationals at Clover Park. Escobar, who hit 28 dingers last season, is 6-for-18 in the Grapefruit League. During a night game, Mets outfielders lost balls in the lights. Brandon Nimmo couldn’t locate a fly ball from Alcides Escobar and had to dive backwards, the ball bouncing off his glove. Mark Canha never saw a lazy fly ball from Juan Soto, lifting his arms in confusion before the ball bounced several feet to his left. Tomas Nido, who is having a nice spring, knocked a home run that was called a double — thankfully replay was not used to overturn the ruling — and lined an RBI single into left field. The Mets visit the Cardinals at Roger Dean Stadium for a 1:05 p.m. game. Jacob deGrom is the scheduled starter but may be scratched after reporting some tightness in his right shoulder.
