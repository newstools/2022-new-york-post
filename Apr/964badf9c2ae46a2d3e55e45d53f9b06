Drone footage taken on Monday, April 18 showed dozens of new graves for those who died during Russia’s invasion of the northern Ukrainian town of Irpin. Reuters reporters saw at least three new rows of graves, most of which had markings labeled with a date of death after February 24 – the day when Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia called its action a special military operation to demilitarise Ukraine and eradicate what it calls dangerous nationalists. The West and Kyiv accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of unprovoked aggression. A family that came to bury a loved one on Monday said that their relative was killed by Russian forces during their occupation of Irpin. Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars.
