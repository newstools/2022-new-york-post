A California coroner is probing the untimely death of 34-year-old Dance Gavin Dance bassist Tim Feerick, an official told The Post on Friday. The rocker was found dead Wednesday of unknown causes at a modest apartment complex known as “The Retreat” on the city’s east side, according to records from the coroner’s office in Sacramento, Calif. Members of the post-hardcore screamo band announced Feerick’s passing on social media Thursday, prompting an outpouring of grief from dedicated fans. A small crowd of friends and band devotees gathered at the city’s Afterburner mural Thursday night to light candles and blast Dance Gavin Dance tunes on a portable speaker in Feerick’s honor, footage shows. Others mourned from afar. “Lighting [a candle] all the way from Scotland tonight. Been a fan of DGD since early 2014, Tim is and forever will be my inspiration as a bassist,” one fan wrote on Twitter. “Rest in peace, Tim.” Another added, “I just started crying in Starbucks, what the f**k. RIP Tim. Man, this can’t be real.” Team USA Olympian weightlifter Mattie Rogers bemoaned the loss of an indie legend, whose music sprinkled in elements of jazz, punk and funk. “This one hurts. RIP Tim and love and comfort to family and friends,” she wrote. On Thursday, the band announced Feerick’s death on Twitter, writing, “We are absolutely devastated to share the news that our friend and bass player, Tim Feerick, passed away last night.” Feerick first joined the band as a touring member in 2009 before joining officially in 2012. The band was scheduled to embark on a 19-date national tour later this month, according to its website. On Friday, Dance Gavin Dance’s latest music video, “Synergy,” had been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
