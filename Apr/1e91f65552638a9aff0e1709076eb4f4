From “Good Morning America” to Amazon Prime time? ABC news reporter Kaylee Hartung has emerged as the leading candidate to be the sideline reporter on Amazon’s Prime Video’s exclusive “Thursday Night Football” coverage this fall, The Post has learned. Hartung, 36, would be on the main broadcast with play-by-player Al Michaels and analyst Kirk Herbstreit. While Hartung joined ABC in 2019 from CNN, she has a sports background having been a reporter for five years at ESPN. She worked on the College Football Playoff, the College World Series and appeared on the SEC and Longhorn networks. She likely could continue at ABC, while adding Amazon duties. Like ESPN, ABC is owned by Disney. Herbstreit is working now for both ESPN and Amazon, which establishes a precedent for Hartung to do the same. Hartung does news reports for all of ABC’s programming. Amazon declined comment, while Hartung could not be immediately reached.
