Dramatic bodycam video captured the moment Indianapolis police officers rescued two children and their mother from a raging fire in their apartment building. The cops were among the first to arrive at the blaze, which erupted about 3:40 a.m. April 11 in the building on Burkhart Drive and sent thick smoke billowing into the air. “Please hurry! I can’t breathe! I’ve got my kids in here!” the woman cried, the video posted by Fox 59 shows. A cop identified as “Officer Carroll” asked the frantic mother how old her kids wee. “Two and 3,” she responds. “You wanna try and pass them down to me, real quick?” Carroll says. One by one, the mom drops the youngsters into the hands of the hero cops. She then also jumps out the window and is caught. “You did so good. You guys are so brave. One day, you are going to get to tell a story about how you jumped out of a two-story window … You looked like Spiderman,” an officer tells the children after the heart-pounding rescue. The fire started after another resident knocked over a candle, officials said. Twenty residents were evacuated but no one was seriously hurt, according to the report.
