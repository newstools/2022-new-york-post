He’s a gone-fella. An infamous mob assassin from upstate New York who murdered three rivals in the ’80s has escaped from federal custody in Florida, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. Dominic Taddeo, 64, who also attempted to whack former Rochester Mafia captain Thomas Marotta on two occasions, was recently serving time at a medium-security federal facility in Coleman, Florida. Taddeo had since been transferred to a halfway house to prepare for his scheduled release in a year. The Cosa Nostra killer went out for an approved medical appointment on March 28 and never returned, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Taddeo had a previous bid for “compassionate” release on COVID-19 grounds denied in 2020. Judge Frank Geraci Jr. cited the gravity of Taddeo’s crimes in rejecting the request and federal prosecutors argued that he wasn’t at heightened health risk due to the pandemic. Taddeo is no stranger to life on the lam. Up against federal firearms raps, Taddeo was sprung on bail in 1987 and eluded capture for two years while operating under a series of aliases in several states. He was finally cuffed after an informant told authorities that he was planning to meet his brother in Toledo. Taddeo pleaded guilty to RICO charges in 1992. The raps included the murders of three Rochester mafiosi in 1982 and 1983.
