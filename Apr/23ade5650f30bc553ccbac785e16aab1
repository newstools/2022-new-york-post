I’m expecting Si Woo Kim to play well at Augusta, so I wanted to find a way to back him. Taking him to finish as the top Asian player at +333 odds is what I landed on. Kim’s main competition in this market will be Hideki Matsuyama (+175) and Sungjae Im (+225). Hideki will have pressure as the defending champion and is still fighting an injury, so he may not be at 100 percent. And Sungjae really hasn’t been in that great of form this season — he has lost strokes on approach in five of his last seven events. Meanwhile, Kim has been able to string together some good results this year. He hasn’t lost strokes with his ball striking since the Tournament of Champions in January. And for as inconsistent as he is perceived to be, Augusta has been fairly steady for him. He’s finished inside the top 25 in three of the last four years with a 34th-place finish in 2020 to break up that trend. We’ll have to dodge longer shots as well in Takumi Kanaya (9/1) and Keita Nakajima (12/1). Lee and Nakajima will be making their debuts while Kanaya finished 58th in his lone appearance as an amateur. Of the group, I wouldn’t say Nakajima worries me, but he was the one I wanted to get some money on this week. He was the one I was targeting for Top Amateur. He won in Japan last year and made the cut at the Sony, but the books were keen on him from the get-go and have him as the clear favorite for Top Amateur. The play: Si Woo Kim to finish as the Top Asian +333.
