Trevor Bauer has been handed down a lengthy suspension from Major League Baseball over allegations of sexual misconduct from 2021. The Dodgers pitcher will be suspended for 324 games – the length of two full regular seasons — beginning Friday. It is the longest doled out in the six-year history of the league’s domestic violence policy. Bauer was accused of punching and choking a woman into unconsciousness over two sexual encounters. He has been on administrative leave with the MLB since July and has not appeared in a game since then, missing 99 contests to this point. The 31-year-old has repeatedly denied the allegations, insisting the acts were consensual. He did so again via his Twitter account on Friday after the suspension was handed down. He will not receive credit for any time spent on administrative leave and will not be eligible to return until the 2024 season — if his already announced appeal falls through. “In the strongest possible terms, I deny committing any violation of the league’s domestic violence & sexual assault policy,” he wrote. “I am appealing this action and expect to prevail. As we have throughout this process, my representatives & I respect the confidentiality of the proceedings.” In February, the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office announced it would not be pressing charges over the sexual assault allegations made against Bauer. The former Cy Young winner has filed defamation lawsuits against his accuser and her lawyer, claiming they filed a false police report in which she claimed he “sexually assaulted her during their second sexual encounter by choking her unconscious on two occasions, punching her in the face and vagina repeatedly and scratching her face.” Bauer has also levied defamation suits against Deadspin, The Athletic and its former writer Molly Knight.
