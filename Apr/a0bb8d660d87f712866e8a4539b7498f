A tattoo lover has revealed how ankle surgery left her favorite design illegible. She posted a picture on Reddit showing how medics did not sew her skin back straight after the op, and now con one can read it. She shared a photo of the tattoo on her foot with the caption: “My tattoo didn’t get sewn back together properly.” The tattoo fan explained in the Reddit post that her tat was originally the letters VFD. It stands for Volunteer Fire Department, a mystery organization in the Lemony Snicket books “A Series Of Unfortunate Events.” She said she got the tattoo because she is a big fan of the novels. But now the letters have been rendered unreadable. Despite that unfortunate event, Redditors said the new design was “cool”. One said: “Solid icebreaker for life you got there.” Another one said: “Still looks quite cool, the tattoo has a Very Fortunate Design” One Redditor joked: “Between you getting the tattoo there, being cut in that same spot, and it not healing properly. “Could that be considered a series of unfortunate events?” “That’s a Very Fine Decoration!,” another joked. “A sharpie will fix that in a hot second,” said another.
