It’s a limited NBA slate Wednesday – only six games fill the card – but Joe Dellera of The Action Network is zoning in on one player prop bet. For his bet, Dellera is looking to Chicago as the Boston Celtics pay a visit to the Bulls and its struggling defensive unit. As for his prop bet, Dellera is targeting Celtics swingman Jayson Tatum over 2.5 three-pointers made in the contest. “Since the All-Star break, Tatum is averaging 31.1 points per game on 50 percent shooting from the field and 41.3 percent shooting from downtown,” Dellera explains. Just in terms of Tatum’s three-point percentage, he’s seen it rise almost 10 percent since the mid-season break. Additionally, the Bulls’ defense has posted below-average defensive metrics over the last two weeks. It was already allowing 113.4 points per 100 possessions, but that number has risen to over 118 points per 100 possessions in the last 14 days. Further, although the Bulls can limit teams’ attempts from three, it’s not necessarily forcing misses. The Bulls allow opponents to shoot 36 percent from distance, a mark that ranks bottom-five in the league. Although there’s a good amount of juice on Tatum’s prop – it currently sits at -150 on BetMGM – he’s cleared it in 51 percent of all games this season and 66 percent of Celtics victories.  With that latter trend in mind, Dellera is also going to add the Celtics moneyline into a same-game parlay. That brings the overall price down to +115 on both DraftKings and BetMGM, a price that highly intrigues Dellera. The play: Celtics ML + Tatum ‘over’ 2.5 3’s parlay, +115
