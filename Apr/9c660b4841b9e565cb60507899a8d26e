Charlotte Flair beat Ronda Rousey at WrestleMania 38 Saturday to retain her Smackdown Women’s title, but an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction stole headlines. During the match, Flair suffered a nip slip when her left breast fell out of her blue top while she laid on her back in the ring. The broadcast went dark temporarily in order to shield Flair, but fans shared screen grabs of the NSFW moment on social media. The 35-year-old ended the fight with a powerhouse kick to Rousey’s face before pinning the former UFC star to become the first woman in history to win four WrestleMania matches. Flair, who has yet to addressed the incident, took to Instagram after the victory to share a photo of her holding her Smackdown title belt. “At all costs,” she wrote in her caption. She said that same line in a post-match interview. “This is my show, my division. [Rousey] thought she was going to walk out with my baby, out of the AT&T Stadium, where I made the inaugural the Raw Women’s championship famous. No, I don’t think so,” Flair said while holding her championship belt. “I said I was going to win at all costs. I don’t care how I win, but I won. I retained. I’m still the Smackdown Women’s champion.” Her father, WWE legend, Ric Flair was in attendance at WrestleMania 38 on Saturday. “I Couldn’t Be Prouder Watching @MsCharlotteWWE LIVE at #WrestleMania! WOOOOO!” Flair tweeted from inside AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. In a separate tweet, Flair wrote that the match between his daughter and Rousey is “the greatest women’s wrestling match” he’s ever seen. “So Real & Authentic! Thank You @RondaRousey & @MsCharlotteWWE For Changing The Game! WOOOOO! #WrestleMania,” Flair tweeted.
