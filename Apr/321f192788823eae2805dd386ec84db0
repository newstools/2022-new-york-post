Johnny Manziel is living it up in Miami with his new rumored girlfriend Kenzie Werner, a Houston-based beauty and hospitality specialist. The Fan Controlled Football star put on a PDA show with Werner at Marion Miami restaurant and lounge Thursday night, where he was filmed dancing with Werner on his shoulders. Manziel reposted the party videos to his Instagram story and included a clip that showed the former Texas A&M quarterback grabbing Werner’s breasts as the two laughed. Manziel posted two photos to Instagram with Werner at the restaurant and seemingly confirmed the relationship in his caption, writing, “So much for a sneaky link .” “My sneaky,” Werner wrote in the comments. “I was curious as hell too  ,” wrote Evan Turner, a former NBA player-turned assistant coach for the Celtics. Manziel can be seen dancing on tables at Marion Miami in other clips posted to his Instagram story. He also shared a closeup photo that showed Werner laughing, with the caption, “But she never wants to leave the club.” On Tuesday, Manziel and Werner were spotted on the beach in Miami, where she modeled a beige thong bikini while she applied sunscreen to the ex-NFL quarterback. It’s unclear when Manziel and Werner got together, but the pair has been spending a lot of time together recently, and things seem to be heating up. After a successful college football career at Texas A&M, Manziel was selected with the 22nd overall pick by the Browns in the 2014 NFL Draft. Legal scandals contributed to Manziel’s failed pro career, and he was eventually waived by the Browns in March 2016. Manziel has been open in recent years about his struggles with substance abuse and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
