The latest accusation of wrongdoing by the Washington Commanders entails stealing from the league’s other 31 teams. The Commanders did not hand over to the NFL the full 40 percent of ticket sales from home games to be added to the pot and dispersed evenly among visiting teams, according to a FrontOfficeSports.com report. So, Washington is alleged to have skimmed off the top while getting its full 1/32nd of the pie from other teams’ home games. The House Oversight Committee that has been investigating the Commanders and owner Daniel Snyder for months dating back to allegations of sexual misconduct and a hostile work environment has expanded its scope, according to the report citing two anonymous sources, claiming one person informed Congress of the ticket scheme. If the allegations are proven accurate, it could be the “death knell” for Snyder’s ownership, a league source told Pro Football Talk. Owners can vote to force another to sell under extreme circumstances. Washington reported the second-lowest attendance (52,751 fans per game) in the league for the 2021 season. Other game revenues such as concessions and parking are not pooled to be shared league-wide. “My understanding is that the early returns of ticket sales are going very well in Washington,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters at the owners’ meetings last week, per Front Office Sports. “They are making a lot of progress. We are very optimistic going into the season.” Goodell also said last week that Snyder “has not been involved in day-to-day operations” since he was levied a $10 million fine and ceded control to his wife Tanya in July 2021. The Washington Post refuted that report and said Snyder is running the organization on a daily basis. Revenue from ticket sales is factored into making the league’s annual salary cap. The NFL declined comment on the report of a ticket scheme.
