It was a not-so-friendly filter. Courteney Cox, 57, attempted to use the viral “Friends” Instagram filter over the weekend — but things didn’t quite go as planned. The series star posted a video to Instagram showing the filter as it cycled through all six cast members’ faces while she tested the authenticity of each, reported People. Cox started out with the face of David Schwimmer, 55, who played Ross Gellar, but she is unable to see the semblance. “Really? I don’t look anything like Schwimmer,” Cox said, attempting to mimic Schwimmer’s nerdy voice. Next up on the rotation was lovable lunk Joey Tribbiani who was portrayed by Matt LeBlanc, 54. “Joey. Hi! How you doin’?” Cox said, copying Joey’s trademark greeting to women. “Oh, looks good with an earring. Or two.” After that, the video rolled farther downhill. The third face absolutely stumped the actress, making her question the authenticity of the filter. “Who is that? Is that Monica? Not sure. Rachel? I don’t know,” she said. “This is one of the worst apps I’ve ever seen, but OK.” Cox was able to identify her own face relatively easy; however, she seriously doubted her confidence once she noticed the eyebrows on the app. “Is that me? Okay, I think my eyebrows are a little different … Rachel? I don’t buy it,” she proclaimed. The movie and television star has been candid about having facial work done in the past and about how, now that she is nearing a milestone birthday, she is done getting fillers. “I feel terrible about myself,” the actress joked, looking at her filter.
