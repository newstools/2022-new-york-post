Four people suffered gunshot wounds in separate shootings near Indiana University early Saturday morning, according to Fox 59. The first shooting occurred around 1:10 a.m. when police responded to gunfire inside Kalao Night Club on the 300 block of N Walnut St. A 26-year-old man was shot in the pelvis while a 41-year-old man and a 22-year-old man were both shot in the thigh, according to Bloomington police. The three victims were taken to a local hospital in unknown conditions. About 20 minutes later, police received a call that a 26-year-old man was shot near 6th and Lincoln streets — under a mile away from the nightclub. The victim was found in the front passenger seat of a vehicle with a gunshot wound to his abdomen. He was rushed to the hospital and required surgery. Two suspects were taken into custody, according to Indiana University. Police are still pursuing a third suspect, but the university said the threat to the campus is “no longer imminent.” Police have not released the identities of those involved in both shootings.
