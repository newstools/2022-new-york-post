There’s now a greater emphasis within the organization on hitting information and analysis, even if Lawson said he wasn’t going to throw everything at the Yankees’ hitters at once. After about three weeks of a condensed spring training and with less than a week until Opening Day, the reviews of the Yankees’ hitting coaches — including assistant hitting coach Casey Dykes, who was promoted from Triple-A hitting coach — have been positive.
