Two Yankees players remained unvaccinated against COVID-19 with about two days remaining left to fulfill Canada’s laws for eligibility to enter the country and play in a series against the division-rival Blue Jays in Toronto that starts May 2, The Post has learned. As of Thursday, with some Yankees having received a vaccine in recent months, the Yankees were still waiting on two starting players who were considered unvaccinated. To fulfill Canada’s requirement, players must be vaccinated at least 14 days before entering the country in order to play in games there. Canada’s stricter vaccination laws are expected to be an issue for MLB teams. Three A’s players — pitchers AJ Puk and Kirby Snead and catcher Austin Allen — were placed on the restricted list Friday and were ineligible to play in Oakland’s weekend series at Toronto that began Friday night. The Rangers were fully vaccinated before the season-opening series at Toronto. The entire Blue Jays’ roster is vaccinated, as well. In order to meet Canada’s requirement, a player or staff member must have received either the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or gotten both shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at least two weeks prior to arriving in Canada. The Yankees presumably will travel to Toronto on May 1 after their afternoon game at Kansas City. The Yankees play nine games this year at the Rogers Centre in Toronto.
