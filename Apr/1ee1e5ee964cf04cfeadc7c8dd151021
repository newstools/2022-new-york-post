The first 100 days of Mayor Eric Adams in office do not exactly have New Yorkers doing handstands. But really, anyone not named de Blasio has got to be an upgrade. We will give him another 100 days, but with bullets flying day and night in NYC, a crowd strolling Times Square on Sunday began sprinting uptown after a manhole cover blew. The frightened flock fled faster than the entire basketball program left Saint Peter’s. The Mets are in Philly. Both teams have high hopes. The Mets’ Tylor Megill pitched five frames in D.C. on opening day. No runs, three hits, six Ks. The Phillies’ lineup is formidable; the pitching rotation isn’t. The Mets staff is stacked with aces (Jacob deGrom, Max Scherzer, Chris Bassitt). After Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola (meat and potatoes), the rest of the rotation is cereal filler. Wheeler makes his first start of the year after going 18-12 over the last two. 10 units on Philly. The Bomber bats were silenced. Alex Manoah and the Blue Jays’ pen allowed four harmless hits, and Toronto shut out the Yankees, 3-0. We win. Up +12 bautistas.
