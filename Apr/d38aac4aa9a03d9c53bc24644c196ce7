Cowboys cornerback Kelvin Joseph was riding in a vehicle from which several shots were fired in March, killing 20-year-old Cameron Ray, his attorney told the Dallas Morning News. However, the attorney – Barry Sorrels – insists that Joseph was unarmed and did not pull the trigger. “Kelvin Joseph did not shoot Cameron Ray,” Sorrels told the News. “Mr. Ray’s death is a tragedy, and Kelvin extends his deepest condolences for the family’s loss. On the night of March 17, Kelvin was unarmed and was not looking for violence. He found himself in a situation that escalated without his knowledge or consent. “Along with condolences to the Ray family, Kelvin apologizes to the Dallas community for being anywhere near this type of incident. The investigation is ongoing, and we intend to respect the process.” On Friday, Joseph met with Dallas police, per Matt Howerton of WFAA, who reported that police investigators questioned Joseph for “a few hours.” Joseph did not comment as he left his attorney’s office and got in a waiting car. On March 18, Ray was gunned down outside the OT Tavern in the Lower Greenville area of Dallas, Tx. Police had initially wanted to question Joseph as a person of interest, as he had been seen with others believed to be involved with the shooting. Now, his attorney is revealing that he was in fact in the car with the shooters – but did not pull the trigger. “Along with condolences to the Ray family, Kelvin apologizes to the Dallas community for being anywhere near this type of incident. The investigation is ongoing, and we intend to respect the process.” Joseph had been identified in surveillance footage by a necklace with the letters “YKDV” encrusted on a necklace. The cornerback also goes by the rapper pseudonym “YKDV Bossman Fat.” The Cowboys drafted Joseph, 22, in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He started two games for Dallas, logging two pass deflections and a fumble recovery. He played his college football at LSU.
