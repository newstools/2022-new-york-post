The former Kentucky cop who fatally shot Breonna Taylor — sparking a wave of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 — is suing to get his job back, according to a report Thursday. Ex-detective Myles Cosgrove claims the Louisville Metro Police Merit Board acted “in violation of due process” when it upheld his firing for the shooting last year, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Cosgrove —  who shot 16 times into the 26-year-old EMT’s apartment during a botched no-knock raid in March 2020 — also argues that a member of the board, Sgt. Justin Witt, had a “conflict of interest” that warranted a recusal from the vote. The board’s decision was “arbitrary and unlawful due to actions in excess of its authority or in violation of due process,” according to the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Jefferson Circuit Court. Cosgrove was fired in January 2021 for violating use-of-force procedures and failing to use a body camera during the raid. At the time, he slammed Louisville Metro Police Department honchos for buckling to “political pressures.” During the raid, Taylor, who was black, was killed by Cosgrove after her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire on him and former Detective Brett Hankison. Walker has claimed the officers failed to announce they were police when they stormed the home. Cosgrove’s lawsuit also alleges that the police board failed to consider the finding by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s office that he was legally justified in returning gunfire because Walker pulled the trigger first. Cosgrove did not face any criminal charges following the incident. Hankison was charged with wanton endangerment in the first degree and was found not guilty in March. In October 2020, Cosgrove said he was in hiding with his family and had launched an online fundraiser in order to retire because it was no longer possible for him to do his job “safely.”
