Garcelle Beauvais regrets curving Michael Jordan. In her new memoir, “Love Me As I Am,” the actress recalls a golf date with the NBA icon, and writes, “I was impressed by how tall and handsome he was. He took me on a golf date after the shoot and showed me how to hold a club properly and swing.” Beauvais admits in the book that she ended things with Jordan after he invited her on a romantic trip to Hawaii. “Like a naive little girl, I was ‘clutching my pearls’ and shocked by the idea of going to Hawaii with a man I had just met,” she writes, adding, “I blew that one!” It’s unclear when the date took place, or how long the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star was involved with Jordan. Beauvais is currently single, and in no rush to settle down. She went through a public divorce in 2010 with her ex Mike Nilon after she discovered that he had an affair. Jordan, meanwhile, went on to marry model Yvette Prieto in 2013, and they welcomed twin daughters in February 2014. He has not yet responded to his mention in Beauvais’ book. “I don’t want to just bring anybody in as a seat filler,” she said earlier this month. “I really want it to be the person. I feel like we put so much pressure on women to have a man, be married, have kids. Can we just live our lives?” Beauvais has been in New York this week promoting her new memoir, which released on Tuesday. Her famous friends helped promote the biography on social media, including Gabrielle Union, Paris Hilton, Jamie Foxx and Andy Cohen.
