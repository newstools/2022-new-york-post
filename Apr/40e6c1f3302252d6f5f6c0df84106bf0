Joe Rogan, best known for his controversial podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” was the subject of a widespread death hoax on Twitter. The 54-year-old podcaster started trending Wednesday morning after several sources began circulating tweets with false information that he had died, according to Newsweek. “We are saddened to announce the passing of Joe Rogan,” read a bogus tweet from @joerogannhq. “He died peacefully in his home this afternoon, we will provide more details as they arrive, with respect to his family’s wishes.” The death hoax even contained false statements from Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), with a screenshot of a counterfeit tweet saying that they were grieving for Rogan’s family. “The entire UFC family is devastated to hear of Joe Rogan’s passing,” the phony tweet read. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family she loved ones, and we will make sure to continue his legacy. – Dana White” The fabricated tweet has since been deleted but a screenshot remains online. Other pranksters said that they had a statement from Rogan’s family. This is not the first time people have falsely claimed the podcaster’s death, according to Mel Magazine, which documented the many hoaxes over the years. Rogan, who has come under fire for recent inflammatory comments, seemingly responded to his alleged death by retweeting one of the articles and saying, “I’m pregnant.” Earlier in the day, he was tweeting promotion images for a Las Vegas standup show. On Tuesday, Rogan angered activist groups when he said transgender swimmer Lia Thomas competing against cisgender women is akin to an “assault on women’s sports,” according to TMZ. He also said it’s “the woke straw that broke society’s camel’s back.” Last week, Rogan threatened to quit podcasting if he has to “walk on eggshells” after his show drew the ire of several listeners.
