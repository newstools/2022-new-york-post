Mayor Eric Adams has called a meeting with the NYPD’s commanding officers to solicit ideas about combatting soaring crime in the Big Apple ahead of the historically bloody summer month, The Post has learned. Hizzoner is set to sit down with the COs Saturday afternoon in One Police Plaza — and he’s asked them to each bring three plans to reduce crime in their patrol areas, according to sources. Adams has also requested statistics on crime, summonses, homeless encampment clearings and Civilian Complaint Review Board cases, as well as information on each command’s integrity control officer, the sources said. The mayor confirmed the upcoming meeting during an interview with The Post’s editorial board on Wednesday. “I have a major meeting this weekend with all of my commanders,” he said. “We’re going to sit down for several hours to get our summer plan in order, as well as, think how we deploy police.” The planned sit-down is similar to the department’s Compstat meeting in which COs are grilled on crime in their patrols areas. But not everyone is taking it seriously. One source with knowledge of the meeting quipped that commanders think bringing ideas to combat crime is a “joke.” The gathering comes as Adams ends his fourth month in office with crime and gun violence still on the rise — after sailing to a mayoral victory campaigning on getting the bloodshed under control in Gotham. As of Sunday, shootings remained up 2% from the same time last year, when the city was in the midst of a historic uptick in gun violence that started in the early weeks of the pandemic. Crime overall remains up nearly 30% from 2017, the police data shows.
