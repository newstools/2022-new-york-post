Fashion designer Ralph Lauren and his wife Ricky have just bought a $4 million Upper East Side apartment, according to property records. The co-op is in addition to a swanky spread they’ve owned in the building, at 1107 Fifth Ave., for more than four decades. It was sold by the estate of Nancy Norman Lassalle, a patron of the School of American Ballet (SAB) and one of its founding board members at SAB and New York City Ballet, who studied with George Balanchine’s original academy in 1941. The Laurens raised their children in the duplex — initially done by the iconic late interior designer Angelo Donghia. By 2012, the Laurens completed a gut renovation after three decades in the building that, in part, “repurposed” their kids’ bedrooms, according to an Elle Decor feature at the time, which showcased the new look, featuring clean lines, open spaces and stairs. The 26-unit, 13-story building, on the corner of 92nd Street, dates to 1924 and comes with stunning Central Park and reservoir views. It was built by the George A. Fuller Company on the site of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post Hutton’s mansion (with her second of four husbands, E.F. Hutton) and designed by W.K. Rouse and L.A. Gladstone. Fuller convinced Hutton to sell, and in return recreated her former home on the building’s top three floors — creating a 54-room triplex penthouse with a private entrance at 2 E. 92nd St. She even had the interiors of the original mansion fitted into the penthouse. It was later divided into six nine-room apartments. The Laurens also have a home in Bedford and a collection of properties from Colorado to Jamaica.
