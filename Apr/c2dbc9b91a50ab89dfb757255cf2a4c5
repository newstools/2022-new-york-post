She’s now in hot water as well. TikTok’s self-proclaimed “hot mom” Aga Bordes is being slammed by users for fueling impossible beauty standards when she said it took two weeks to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight, according to the Daily Mail. In the latest video, Bordes is doing what she calls a “hot mom walk” down the street with her 2-week-old child. “POV: You’re two weeks postpartum, fit again in all your clothes, it’s a beautiful sunny day, you’re on your hot mom walk, your baby is full and happy, life is good,” she captioned the video. The blonde was clad in formfitting blue leggings and a white crop top in the clip, which gained almost half a million views. Several female TikTok users immediately slammed Bordes for her “unrealistic” attitude. “Let’s not normalize everything being back to normal two weeks postpartum. I couldn’t even leave my house for the first two months,” one disgruntled mother commented. “You must be insecure to have to post all about it. Way to go by making other first-time mums feel they should be exercising, eating healthy,” another person commented. Other TikTok users managed to poke fun at themselves rather than go after the young mother while others admired from afar. “Me at 28 weeks post-partum still wearing my maternity leggings,” said one woman. “She looks amazing so she’s more than allowed to embrace it … I will however cry into my pizza,” said a user. “Girl I’m in mad envy of you,” another chimed in. “You 100% get to brag about this.” Bordes did not respond directly to those users who said mean things but simply wished well all the mothers who commented and admitted that even she could not dodge the maternity pads. “I am healthy and happy and not afraid to show it,” Bordes said. “I might be struggling with other things that others aren’t,” the influencer, who posted follow-up videos detailing her process, said. Bordes added that she believes the people attacking “just feel bad about themselves.”
