A gory scene unfolded on a busy Queens street earlier this month when a maniac grabbed a knife from a foot cart and slashed a homeless man in the face, according to police and sources. The NYPD released a photo of the alleged slasher covered in his 26-year-old victim’s blood following the attack at Broadway and 73rd Street in Jackson Heights at about 10:40 p.m. March 18. The slashing occurred just steps away from the bustling neighborhood’s main subway stop. The suspect and the victim had gotten into an argument near an unattended Halal cart, sources said, before the madman snatched an 8-inch knife with a 4-inch blade and gashed the homeless man in the face. The victim was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where he required 20 sutures, according to cops and sources. His attacker was caught on security footage covered in blood, holding a pack of Marlboro Reds and pointing at an unknown object.
