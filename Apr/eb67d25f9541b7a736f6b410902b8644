The Ravens gave their defensive line a boost on Saturday, re-signing defensive end Calais Campbell to a two-year deal, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter. Campbell, 35, had considered retirement but ultimately opted to return in order to chase a first-ever Super Bowl ring. His deal is worth $12.5 million but could be pushed up to $16.5 million with incentives, per Schefter. Campbell is the second player the Ravens have brought back in as many days from their defense, which struggled last season. Middle linebacker Josh Bynes also re-signed on Friday. Though Campbell has traditionally been a strong pass rusher, he had just 1.5 sacks last season. He did play well on run defense, though, and finished with 49 tackles. “I have a lot of admiration for Calais as a person and as a player and as a leader,” Ravens GM Eric DeCosta said after the season. “He’s a guy that plays winning football and he does that as much for the team and the organization in the building as he does on the field. I have a lot of respect for him.” Campbell has been in the league since 2008 and is a member of the NFL’s 2010s All-Decade team.
