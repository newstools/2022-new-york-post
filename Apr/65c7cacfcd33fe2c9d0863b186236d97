A video from last month of Aaron Rodgers shows the Packers quarterback getting picked off by a high school receiver — before throwing the ball at the teen’s legs. In video posted by the NFL, Rodgers is seen throwing during a charity flag football event at JSerra Catholic High School’s Lions Field in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. The quarterback did a few pump-fakes while looking for an open target before Darius Maxwell, in a No. 5 jersey, intercepted the ball. Maxwell celebrated by hand-delivering the ball back to the reigning NFL MVP, who appeared to retaliate by aiming for the player’s legs. But it was all in fun. The flag football event, which according to Pro Football Talk took place on March 12, raised $375,000. The moment called to mind Peyton Manning’s “Saturday Night Live” United Way skit from 2007 in which he threw the ball at kids. The NFL tagged Maxwell in the video, which racked up nearly half a million likes in its first day Instagram. The wideout, meanwhile, committed to Wheeling University in West Virginia in January.
