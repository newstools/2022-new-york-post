When it comes to charity, President Biden and Vice President Harris came up short compared to their fellow Americans, a review of their tax returns shows. The president and First Lady Jill Biden reported $610,702 in income for 2021 and paid $183,925 in federal and state income taxes. The couple gave $17,394 to charity, or about 2.8%. That’s roughly 0.3 % less than the average charitable deduction for Americans making between $500,000 and $2 million, according to 2016 data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. In Harris’ case, the disparity was worse. The vice president and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, earned $1,655,563 in 2021 and paid $523,371 in federal income taxes. The couple donated $22,100 — or 1.3% — to charity. The figure is considerably less than the 3.1% on average donated by those making between $500,000 and $2 million. The giving disparity between the Biden and Harris families was first reported by Fox News. The Tax Policy Center data showed the poorest Americans were by far the most generous, with those making less than $50,000 who itemized charitable deductions donating 8.4%. Biden’s largest charitable donation of 2021 was a $5,000 gift to the Beau Biden Foundation, named in honor of his son who died of cancer in 2015. The Bidens were considerably more generous in 2020, donating $30,704 of their income to charity, or about 5%. The Beau Biden Foundation is officially dedicated to protecting children from abuse, but unofficially has long served as a clearinghouse for Biden cronies to collect fat paychecks. The organization’s executive director Patricia Dailey Lewis, served as Delaware deputy attorney general while when Beau Biden served as AG. She pocketed $150,660 in 2020, including a $3,500 bonus, records show. Joshua Alcorn, another longtime Biden political consultant, made $131,437 as COO, though he has since stepped down. Board members have included President Biden’s troubled son Hunter as well as Beau’s widow Hallie Biden. The charity only spent 58% of its raised funds on its stated mission — well below top rated philanthropic organizations, industry experts said. “A 58 percent program ratio does not reflect a high level of financial efficiency,” said Laurie Styron, the executive director of CharityWatch told The Post.
