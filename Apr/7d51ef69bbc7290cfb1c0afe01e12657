Kadarius Toney has arrived. The Post’s Ryan Dunleavy confirmed the second-year wideout made his first appearance at the Giants’ voluntary workouts on Monday, a weekend after trade reports began circulating. Toney has been frustrating the Giants’ new regime — GM Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll — by being absent from the previous sessions. Toney had an injury-plagued rookie season in which there were questions about his attitude. The former Florida star was taken by the Giants with the No. 20 pick in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Toney, 23, had 39 catches for 420 yards last season.
