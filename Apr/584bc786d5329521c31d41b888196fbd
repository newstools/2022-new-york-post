Who saved who? When we rescue our four-legged friends from an animal shelter, we often don’t know much about their background or history. And since they automatically become part of our family, it’s only natural to want to know more about these sweet creatures. Celebrate Pet Day by investing in something that will end the mystery surrounding your pooch once and for all — the DNA My Dog Breed Identification Test. Right now this helpful tool is on sale for $59.99, 24% off the usual price, for a limited time in honor of Pet Day! Let the DNA My Dog Breed Identification Test help you learn more about your dog’s ancestry with a painless dog DNA cheek swab. You’ll learn exactly what breeds make up your rescue. If you purchased your pup and know their breed, this test can still be super helpful. It gives information about Fido’s breed makeup, which helps you understand their health better. Discover potential health problems, learn about genetic health concerns and risks for certain dog diseases, and even get more info about personality characteristics. Curious how it works?
