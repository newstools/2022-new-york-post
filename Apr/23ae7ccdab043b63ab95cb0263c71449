We’re finally talking about practice with Ben Simmons. Simmons hasn’t played for the Nets since a February trade with the 76ers due to a back injury, but he will join his teammates in practice in the coming week, according to ESPN, leaving open the possibility of him playing in Brooklyn’s first-round playoff series against the Celtics. According to Post beat writer Brian Lewis, Simmons was hoisting shots when reporters entered practice on Saturday for media access. Simmons turned and said, “Make sure you get this” and proceeded to dunk. The first game of the series is slated for Sunday in Boston. Nets coach Steve Nash said on Friday that Simmons “hasn’t done anything yet,” but ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the three-time All-Star has been “running and shooting without back pain for over a week.” Simmons, who was acquired in the James Harden blockbuster following a holdout with the Sixers, received an epidural shot in March to treat a herniated disk in his lower back. A three-time All-Star and two-time All-Defensive first-team selection, the 25-year-old hasn’t played in a game since the Eastern Conference finals last June. He wanted out of Philadelphia and later sat out, citing mental health issues.
