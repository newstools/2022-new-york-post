A man slashed a woman in the face during a dispute at a Bronx subway station last week, police said Sunday. The two were feuding at the Fordham Road station around 10:55 p.m. on Wednesday night when the man pulled out a knife and cut the 45-year-old victim in the face, cops said. The man fled up the stairs to the street after the attack. He was later spotted inside of a bodega located at 221 East 188 Street, authorities said. The victim was transported by EMS to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition where she was treated for her injuries. Police released video of the suspect inside the bodega wearing a gray jacket, blue jeans, white sneakers and a navy blue winter hat. He had a beard and a blue medical mask around his neck, the footage shows. Those with information regarding the incident are asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
