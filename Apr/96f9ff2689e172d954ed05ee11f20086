The NYPD is putting more cops on patrol at night when nearly half of the gun violence occurs as part of the first phase of its summer violence prevention plan, a department official said. “We are surging a lot more manpower,” Chief of Department Ken Corey said in a briefing Friday evening. “All this is in addition [to the prior added patrols], we are not taking anything away,” he added. The move comes ahead of Mayor Adams’ meeting with police precinct commanders on Saturday to discuss the surge in crime ahead of the historically bloody summer months. As part of the new strategy starting Monday, the department is: “That time of night when we are most thin, we are going to have a lot of coverage out there that we don’t normally have. Nearly half our shootings are happening between that five-hour window [of 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.,” Corey said. The summer plan — dubbed “Summer 40” — will prioritize resources for the patrol boroughs where crime has been the worst by trying to keep the cops who know the areas in their commands instead of pulling for beach patrol or parades. “Those are the highest crime areas we wanted to leave as many officers there as possible,” Corey said. The annual summer shifts at New York City beaches will instead be staffed by cops who are working behind a desk, “rather than pull officers from busy precincts,” the chief added. The NYPD will also be partnering with the New York State Police to set up vehicle checkpoints in high-violence areas. Corey says he believes that will help stop violence before it starts because “people who going out shooting aren’t caring about following traffic rules.” Additionally, the department is working with other city agencies to crack down on street crowds as well as code violations at nightclubs and other places where gun violence has broken out. “By tightening up some of the enforcement and inspection there we can prevent things before they happen,” Corey said.
