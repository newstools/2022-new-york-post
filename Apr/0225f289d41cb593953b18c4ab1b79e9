A North Carolina bus driver has been arrested for paying school kids $5 each to swab their cheeks for COVID-19 tests. Raina McManus, 35, was taken into custody on Tuesday after parents in Charlotte complained that she had allegedly been swabbing students on her bus route, WSOC reported. The bus driver is accused of swabbing students at Ridge Road Middle School without permission from parents or the school, according to her arrest report. Sixth-grader Dynasty Davis told the outlet she was among those swabbed. “She gave me the Q-tip thing … and made me swab my mouth, and when I was done, I put it in the cylinder and gave it to her. Then she gave me $5,” Dynasty said. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools District suspended McManus after the allegations first surfaced before firing her last month. McManus is charged with soliciting without permission of a school official during school hours and privately using a publicly owned vehicle. It wasn’t immediately clear what she was using the COVID tests for. The local outlet reported she was working for the National Institute of Molecular Diagnostics, but the lab had destroyed all the tests. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the lab.
