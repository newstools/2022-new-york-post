Shockingly, this is the first time that Duke and North Carolina have met in March Madness in their storied rivalry. With a championship game berth on the line in Coach K’s last season, this is appointment television.  Gametime: 8:49pm EST TV: TBS Live Stream: CBS Sports App, fuboTV, Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV The teams split the season series; each game decided by double-digits. But the biggest game in the history of the sport’s biggest rivalry won’t be a letdown. Of course, Duke probably will win. Duke probably will win it all, sending Mike Krzyzewski out on top. The most talented team in the Final Four has played its best when it matters most. It is shooting better than 50 percent from the field and over 39 percent on 3-pointers in the first four rounds of the NCAA Tournament. But the Blue Devils were also nearly knocked out of the tournament twice (Michigan State, Texas Tech) and are less than a month removed from losing to the Tar Heels in Krzyzewski’s final home game as a double-digit favorite. North Carolina has sustained the momentum, knocking off Baylor and UCLA as underdogs to improve to 9-1 in its past 10 games and 7-1 against the spread in its past eight games. The Tar Heels’ dynamic offense has had a different leading-scorer in every game of the tournament, and their potential to control the glass and get hot from outside gives them another chance to take down Duke. Ultimately, Krzyzewski probably will find a way to advance. He’s won eight of his past nine national semifinal games. But this one won’t be secured until the final minute.
