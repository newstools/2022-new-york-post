A fruit vendor was grazed by a stray bullet when a gunman opened fire in Upper Manhattan on Tuesday, according to police sources. The 59-year-old victim was selling fruit from his van on Nagle Avenue near Thayer Street in Fort George, and was about to close up shop when he stepped into the street and briefly chatted with a Jeep driver about exchanging parking spots, the sources said. Then, the victim reported, he saw a man walk out of a nearby club and open fire around 10 p.m., according to the sources. The victim said he heard shots and felt pain in his chest area, cops said. He returned to the sidewalk and ducked behind a parked car as pedestrains fled, police sources said. Then he crawled back to his van and checked himself for wounds, according to the sources. He was treated at Harlem Hospital for a graze wound, and listed in stable condition, police said. No arrests were immediately made. When reached by phone, a man who identified himself as the victim’s son said the family did not want to speak about the incident.
