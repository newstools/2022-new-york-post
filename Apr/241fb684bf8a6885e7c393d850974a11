The team, which fell painfully short in last year’s NBA Finals, had been motivated by the loss all season, going 64-18 and earning the most regular-season wins by any team in the past four seasons. Now the title appears up for grabs again, following a hamstring strain suffered by Devin Booker in the Suns’ Game 2 loss to the Pelicans. Phoenix’s leading scorer reportedly maye be sidelined two to three weeks, though the timeline for Booker’s return is still unclear. The Suns are 8-6 without him this season. Sportsbooks have responded by essentially making the Suns (+320) and Warriors (+360) — via BetMGM, though other books list the Warriors as slight favorites — co-favorites, with the Bucks (+500), Celtics (+600) and Heat (+800) close behind. The NBA playoffs aren’t suddenly wide-open — this isn’t the NHL, where a hot goalie and strange puck luck can fuel overmatched teams to victory — but a title is now realistically in reach for a greater collection of teams.
