A cloud of mystery fueled social media conspiracy theories near Lazy Mountain, Alaska, Thursday. Meteor, Russian missile, plane crash and UFO were among the explanations for a ghoulish towering sliver of a cloud with finger-like trails. A rescue team sent to search for a crash on Lazy Mountain found nothing suspicious, Alaska State Troopers reported. “Not sure what but it looked cool,” Heather Isackson wrote on Facebook. “Further investigation revealed that a large commercial jet was flying in that area around the time that the photos and video were taken. The aircraft was contacted and reported normal flight operations on its way to JFK airport in New York,” Alaska State Troopers wrote on Facebook. “Troopers believe that the photos and videos showed a contrail from the commercial jet combined with the rising sun which together caused the unique atmospheric sight. We greatly appreciate the numerous Alaskans that reported the suspicious sight this morning to law enforcement,” they added.
