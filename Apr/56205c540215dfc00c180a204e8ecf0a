A 22-year-old Michigan man has been found guilty of shooting an 18-year-old woman — and then recording himself kicking her for almost 11 minutes until she died. Andrew Lafey shot Gracyn Brickley several times with a .22-caliber rifle behind a house on Guy Road in Maple Grove Township on Feb. 16, 2021, WILX reported. The monster then used his phone to record a nearly 11-minute-long video of himself kicking and taunting her until she died. He then buried Brickley’s body in snow and showed the brutal footage to his friends and his father — who turned him in to the police, according to the news outlet. Lafey was convicted Friday of a slew of charges, including first-degree murder, which carries a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole, felony firearm possession and torture. “We are pleased with the verdict and that justice for Grace Brickley and her family was served,” the Barry County Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement. Prosecutor Julie Nakfoor Pratt described the horrific crime. “The Defendant video taped himself stomping on and taunting Grace Brickley for close to 11 minutes. The torture seen in the video came after Lafey shot Grace Brickley twice and inflicted multiple injuries to her face and breaking her jaw,” she said, according to the outlet. “Justice for Grace Brickley and her family was served,” she added. The sadistic killer is slated to be sentenced June 9.
