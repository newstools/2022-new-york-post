Oh no! Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for COVID? With our vaxxed and doubly boosted “Border Czar” on the mend, is it possible a few people may actually try to enter the country illegally? Naah. Nothing to worry about. Staying in St. Louis. The Mets leave, the D’backs invade. Not sure how they did it but the Snakes beat the mighty Dodgers twice before leaving Arizona. Humberto Castellanos (1-0, 3.00) has appeared in four games, has made two starts and has allowed four runs over a dozen innings. The Cardinals’ Dakota Hudson (1-1, 3.95) was a rock in his latest start, two-hitting the Reds for 6 ²/₃ innings in Cincy. Taking the Cards again for 10 units.  Here we go! Nolan Arenado went 3-for-3 then went after Yoan Lopez after the Mets relief pitcher sought revenge. The Mets batters have been hit more times than Chris Rock has on “Entertainment Tonight.” Mets won the series but the Cards won the finale for us. Final 10-5. Down -12 mccarvers.
