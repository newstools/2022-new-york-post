That was fast! Jonah Hill’s Noho loft is in contract just over five weeks after it first hit the market for $10.99 million. The fancy four-bedroom is in the Schumacher, at 36 Bleecker St. Hill bought it for $9.1 million in 2015. “He’s spending most of his time on the West Coast these days,” said a friend, “and the loft had been rented, so he wasn’t getting use out of it anyways.” Hill recently starred as the chief of staff for a Trumpian-style US president in “Don’t Look Up” — a black comedy about the world ending after ignoring the deadly impact of a comet that is headed towards earth. While shunning NYC, the “The Wolf of Wall Street” actor has been hanging out in Hawaii with his girlfriend Sarah Brady, as The Post previously reported. But his fifth-floor prewar condo in Manhattan isn’t anything to shy away from. It was earlier on the market as a $37,500-a-month rental and comes with original details like exposed brick, 21-foot, barrel-vaulted ceilings — the highest in the building — oversize, arched wood-frame windows and wide-plank white oak floors. At 3,280 square feet, it features unique Hollywood details like a custom-made projector and a screen for “movie-theater quality” entertainment, according to the listing. There’s also a marble chef’s kitchen and great art wall space in the living areas, foyer and gallery. The main bedroom boasts exposed-brick, barrel-vaulted ceilings and features two ensuite spa-like bathrooms and a walk-in custom closet. The smart-wired digs overlook a courtyard designed by Ken Smith, who created MOMA’s roof gardens. The Queen Anne Victorian- and Romanesque Revival-style seven-story building dates to 1920 and features 20 units. Amenities include a gym, children’s playroom, bike room and roof deck with a gas grill. Listing broker Nicholas Gavin of Compass declined to comment.
