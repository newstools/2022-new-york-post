It’s three lions on a rest as these brothers take things easy in the sunshine. Samburu, Shenzis and Shomba are constant companions at GG Conservation sanctuary in Free State, central South Africa. They were snapped by photographer Simon Needham. He said: “They are very loving to each other — but just like other brothers, they can get feisty.” “When people see my photos of the three of them, I get an overwhelming response that they are amazed to see three such handsome lions together and so comfortable with one another.” “It is so heart-warming to see them hanging out like this. “They are very happy lions.” Male lions often form groups with one another when they don’t have to compete for mating rights or battle for their own pride. They are often forced out of prides as they become sexually mature. These groups of males can hunt together and drive off attacks from lone males or full prides.
