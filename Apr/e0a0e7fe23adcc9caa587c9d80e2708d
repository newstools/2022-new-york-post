A Florida state senator who pushed for a mandatory “Victims of Communism Day” in public schools has been tapped as the Sunshine State’s next education chief. Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday formally recommended Manny Diaz to serve as Florida’s new Education Commissioner. A Republican from Hialeah Gardens and a former high school teacher and assistant principal, Diaz would be the first Hispanic to serve in the role. “Manny Díaz has done a great job in the Legislature on education issues ranging from teacher pay to parental rights and choice,” DeSantis said in a statement. “I am confident that he will serve our state well as the Commissioner of Education.” Known as a staunch conservative, Diaz co-sponsored legislation that would mandate an annual lesson on “how victims suffered under these [Communist] regimes through poverty, starvation, migration, systemic lethal violence, and suppression of speech.” The measure passed the Florida legislature and is awaiting DeSantis’ signature. Diaz also supported moves by DeSantis pushing “eliminating CRT and woke training in Florida schools and businesses,” according to a release. Since DeSantis appoints the State Board of Education, the recommendation is likely to result in Diaz’s confirmation. If approved, Diaz will replace outgoing Commissioner Richard Corcoran, who will exit the post at the end of this month. “It is an honor to be recommended by Governor DeSantis to serve as the Education Commissioner,” Diaz said in a statement. “For my entire career I have worked to improve the education system to serve Florida’s students, parents and teachers. I am excited to get to work continuing the mission of the Governor to make Florida the Education State.”
