Al Pacino’s Scarface sagely advised drug dealers never to get high on their own supply. But we wonder if Mike Tyson would actually be in less trouble if he’s toked a little of his own weed line before boarding his flight. The heavyweight legend reportedly lost his temper with an overexcited (and possibly overserved) fan before takeoff on his flight from San Francisco to Miami on Thursday — and seemingly punched the guy several times, leaving the his head bloodied. But The Post hears that news of the incident harshed the collective mellow at the Benzinga Cannabis Conference, because “Iron Mike” was supposed to be the main speaker at a $3000-a-ticket reception on Thursday night. But organizers sent out an email to attendees saying the champ would be late because he’d missed his flight (which is technically true) though he’d still expected to be interviewed by wrestling legend Ric Flair at the after party at LIVE at the Fontainebleu Miami Beach later this evening. A source at the event says that Tyson — who launched his Tyson 2.0 bud line late last year — is already considered “a God in the industry.” In spite of convention bosses’ confidence that he’ll still show up, it’s unclear how a guy who is presumably facing charges in California can just skip town for Miami. But, then, who would want to tell the Baddest Man On The Planet he can’t take a later flight if he wants to? According to 303 Magazine, the Tyson 2.0 line includes strains ranging from mild to high potency, including Billy White, OG Kush, Haymaker and Purple Punch. Apparently the former heavyweight world champion named them himself and “prides himself on being an integral part of the growing, packaging, sampling and selling process.” Tyson has also produced ear-shaped weed gummies that have a bite taken out of them — a reference the the infamous occasion when he bit a chunk out of Evander Holyfield’s ear mid-bout. Hopefully, Holyfield’s getting an, er, cut.
