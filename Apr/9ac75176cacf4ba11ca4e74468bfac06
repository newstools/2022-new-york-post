Britney Spears is going to be a mom once again. The pop icon, who famously told a Los Angeles judge she was forced to be on birth control during her “abusive” conservatorship, made the announcement on Instagram Monday. “I got a pregnancy test … and uhhhhh well … I am having a baby,” Spears, 40, wrote. The “Toxic” crooner, who already shares two children with Kevin Federline, told her legions of fans she originally thought she had gained weight from eating but realized after taking the pregnancy test that she was expecting. Amid Spears’ conservatorship battle last summer, she claimed that her father forced her to get an IUD and she wasn’t allowed to get pregnant. “I want to have the real deal. I want to be able to get married and have a baby. I was told right now under the conservatorship, I’m not able to get married or have a baby,” Spear said during the explosive court hearing as she begged a judge to end the legal arrangement. Spears’ conservatorship was later dissolved in November. The megastar has been engaged to Sam Asghari since September but the pair have been dating for over five years. In her Monday Instagram post, she referred to him as her “husband,” sparking rumors that the two secretly tied the knot. “I lost so much weight to go on my Maui trip only to gain it back  … I thought ‘Geez … what happened to my stomach ???’ My husband said ‘No you’re food pregnant silly,'” she wrote. She noted during her first pregnancies she suffered from perinatal depression and plans to do yoga everyday to remain healthy for baby number three.
