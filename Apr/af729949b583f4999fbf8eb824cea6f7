A high school baseball player was killed and his cousin injured in a Thursday shooting outside Los Angeles, according to police and local reports. Roberto Izelo, 18, and his 19-year-old relative were sitting in a car with another person in a Santa Ana alley around 7:30 p.m. when a suspect approached the vehicle on foot and opened fire, according to police and local reports. Izelo died after being shot in the chest and his unidentified cousin was in stable condition after suffering the same injury, Santa Ana Police said in a statement. Both teens played for Santa Ana’s Century High School baseball team, according to KABC-TV. “Whether or not he (suspect) had a vehicle nearby, we’re still trying to figure that out,”  Santa Ana Police Sgt. Maria Lopez reportedly said. The attack happened after a baseball game in an area with a history of criminal activity and police were investigating if it was gang-related, the station said. “The circumstances or motive surrounding the shooting are currently being investigated,” police said, adding that detectives were investigating the possibility that the shooting was gang-related. “The SAUSD community is deeply saddened by the death of a student at Century High School,” the Santa Ana Unified School District said in a statement posted on Facebook. “We offer our most sincere condolences to the student’s family,” it read. “Crisis counselors have also been sent to support any students and staff at the school dealing with this loss. “Our thoughts are with the Century High School community, and we ask that you kindly respect the privacy of the family and school.”
