Want to upgrade your backyard without spending an arm and a leg on décor and furniture? All you need is a fire pit. Nothing beats spending time outside while enjoying the warmth and ambiance of a real flame. Then again, a fire pit generates a lot of soot and smoke, which only dampens the experience and inconveniences other people. Not to mention, it’s also quite a hassle to set up and clean up. The good news is there is an alternative that you can use both indoors and outdoors. If your place doesn’t come with a fireplace, it doesn’t mean you can no longer enjoy the company of a cozy flame. The Trellick Tabletop Concrete Fire Pit can offer a relaxing ambiance to any space, and for a limited time, you can get it on sale for a special introductory price.  Unlike traditional firepits, this particular tabletop fire pit runs on standard isopropyl rubbing alcohol so there’s no smoke, soot, or mess to clean up afterward. Make no mistake, it’s still very much capable of producing an actual flame, but it’s designed in a way that it’s easy to light and extinguish. Made from high temperature-resistant concrete, this mess-free fire pit is also lightweight and easy to transport, so you can bring it virtually anywhere and enjoy real fire both indoors and outdoors. While it’s ideal to make it the centerpiece of your outdoor patio, it’s also just as great to bring it inside to serve as an interesting element to your dining room or living room table. Whatever you decide, this portable fire pit is a welcome addition to any space. “Required no set up, just read the directions carefully and used immediately. Everyone who comes over loves it, it’s so cool!” exclaimed one happy customer. The Trellick Tabletop Concrete Fire Pit normally retails for $79, but you can grab it for a dropped price of only $74.99 as part of our Lighting Sale. You can select from two designs: hexagon or polyhedron. Prices subject to change.
