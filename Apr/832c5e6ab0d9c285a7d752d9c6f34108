Tammy Sytch, who performed in WWE as Sunny, is suspected of DUI in a car accident that killed a 75-year-old man in Florida. TMZ obtained a police report from the Ormond Beach Police Dept. which said Sytch caused a three-car wreck in which a man died on March 25 on U.S. Highway 1 in Volusia County. According to the report, witnesses said Sytch, 49, was driving a 2012 Mercedes “at a high rate of speed” when she crashed into a 2013 Sorento that was stopped at a traffic light. The Kia then crashed into the Yukon in front of it at the light. The 75-year-old driver of the Kia was transported to the hospital, where he died from the injuries. The police report said that Sytch was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision; a blood test taken from the scene is pending results. “OBPD has requested an expedited timeframe on the processing of these samples,” a police spokesperson told TMZ. “And the results will be made available as soon as the department receives them.” Sytch has been arrested for DWI at least six times. Earlier this year, she was accused of threatening to kill her partner with a pair of scissors. Between 1995-98, Sytch was an enormous WWE star. She was named the most downloaded person on the internet by AOL in 1996. Sytch, who has dabbled in the porn industry in recent years, also later appeared in ECW and WCW. She was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011.
