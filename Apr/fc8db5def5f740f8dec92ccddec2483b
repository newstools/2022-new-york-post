An animal rights protester ensured she was glued to the action during the Clippers-Timberwolves play-in game — literally. A woman attempted an apparent on-court protest when she glued herself to the Target Center floor during the second quarter Tuesday night, TNT sideline Allie LaForce said on the broadcast. “I was just told by security that she apparently had glued herself to the floor and she refused to lift her wrist up,” LaForce said. “They were trying to pull her off and she was resisting trying to keep her wrist glued to the floor.” The incident, which happened under the opposite basket from where Minnesota was shooting free throws with 3:34 to go in the first half, was reportedly in response to the treatment of chickens at Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor’s farm, according to ESPN’s Sarah Spain. The women’s shirt read “Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive.” Spain shared to social media a press release from the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) accusing Taylor of the inhumane killing of 5.3 million chickens in a recent mass killing following an outbreak of bird flu in Taylor’s Iowa egg factory. With the release, the group provided what it says is video evidence to support its claims and identified the protester as activist Alicia Santurio. The protest caused a short delay in the game as the woman was quickly escorted away by security after the glue wasn’t strong enough to bond her to the floor.
