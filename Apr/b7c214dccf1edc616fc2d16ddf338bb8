Michael Kay brought the jokes. In the ninth inning of a 4-3 game between the Yankees and Red Sox that also served as the maiden voyage of the “KayRod” sidecast of ESPN2’s “Sunday Night Baseball,” Kay delivered some subtle humor about co-host Alex Rodriguez’s love life. “It’s a great time in sports,” Kay began. “We have a new Masters champion. The NBA playoffs are about to start. Baseball in full swing. People getting engaged! It’s a happy time in the world.” Kay, of course, was referring to the engagement of Ben Affleck and Rodriguez’s former fiancée, Jennifer Lopez. Affleck proposed with a green diamond ring that  reportedly is worth between $5 and $10 million. For his part, A-Rod took the joke in stride. “Uh, happiness and world peace is what we’re looking for,” he said through laughter. Last March, A-Rod and JLo called off their two-year engagement.
