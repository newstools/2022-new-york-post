It’s not the Metaverse, but it is a gut-renovated Soho penthouse triplex — and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early bitcoin billionaires, have put it on the market for the very real price of $16.95 million. The stunning three-bedroom, 3½-bath, gut-renovated bachelor pad is at 20 Greene St., a seven-story building that dates to 1915 in the historic Cast Iron District. The twins — who moved from a $65 million settlement with Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook to creating their own bitcoin exchange and becoming NFT pioneers who launched their own Nifty Gateway clearinghouse for digital art — bought the penthouse for $14.5 million in 2014. The 4,300-square-foot loft features a sprawling 2,200 square feet of outdoor space and panoramic views of the city form Hudson Yards to the Freedom Tower and the Empire State Building. The penthouse opens to a semi-private elevator landing into the first level, with arched windows and soaring ceilings. The twin billionaire crypto entrepreneurs have smart-wired the home, natch. It’s anchored by a gas fireplace and gallery-length wall. There’s also an open chef’s kitchen and a floating staircase that takes you to the second and third levels. On the second level, a sliding door of steel and glass opens to a library/den/media room with custom millwork, wall paneling, a gas fireplace and a dry bar. The first main bedroom suite is also on this floor. The second level has two bedrooms and two large terraces. A wall of sliding glass doors leads to another terrace. The third level has a wet bar and access to the largest terrace and sweeping city views. The listing brokers are Steven Cohen and Timothy Malone of Douglas Elliman.
