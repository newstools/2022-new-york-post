So much for Gleyber Torres’ good spring. Torres wound up being the odd man out in Friday’s Opening Day lineup against the Red Sox in The Bronx. The Yankees went with DJ LeMahieu at second base, Isiah Kiner-Falefa at shortstop and Josh Donaldson at third base. Donaldson will lead off, followed by Aaron Judge, whose contract talks with the team are going down to the wire. The first pitch is slated for 1:05 p.m. ET after Thursday’s opener was postponed due to inclement weather.
