A woman claims to have found the “perfect” dress for an evening wedding – for just $66. Joanne Lewis took to TikTok to show off the sequined gown from SHEIN, as she admitted she was “so impressed” by the dress. “I think I have found the most perfect evening wedding dress or engagement party dress for $66,” she said. The dress features a front split, a slight train and a one-shouldered detail, which can be taken down and worn as a drape on the waist of the dress. “I got a size small, it’s the smallest size they do, but it does run a little – just a little – bit large on the corset,” Joanne said. “I could get that taken in just a little bit because there’s a lot of stretch in it. “I would also get it taken up, I am only 5-foot so things are always super long on me.” Joanne added: “I am so beyond impressed with this – this looks very very luxurious.” She also suggested the dress would be a brilliant choice for a destination or beach wedding. “Wow amazing,” one person wrote in the comments section of the video. “Great beach dress,” another added. But not everyone was impressed, with one woman writing: “Looks cheap I think you could find something much better.” And in response, Joanne explained that she’s already got her dress for her wedding. “This is just inspo for others,” she added.
