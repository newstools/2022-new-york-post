Four days after Clayton Kershaw being pulled following seven perfect innings caused an uproar, a 20-year-old Japanese phenom who pitched a perfect game in his last start was removed after pitching eight perfect innings. Roki Sasaki, who struck out 19 while achieving perfection in his previous outing, struck out 14 on Sunday while incredibly pitching another eight perfect innings. But his day ended with a 101 mph fastball for his final strikeout at the end of the eighth, as he was pulled after 102 pitches with his Chiba Lotte Marines and the Nippon-Ham Fighters tied 0-0. The Fighters ultimately won 1-0 in 10 innings. Sasaki, whose perfect game last week was the first in Nippon Professional Baseball since 1994, has 56 strikeouts against only two walks in 31 innings this season. “This was so exciting, I don’t have words,” the Fighters’ Chusei Mannami, who hit the winning homer in the 10th inning, said of Sasaki, according to The Japan Times. “Our guys just hung in there, and we kept saying on the bench let’s get something going.” “[Sasaki] is just too tough. The way that forkball drops? Forget about it.” Sasaki’s latest display of dominance will likely create even more intrigue among MLB teams interested in him. Last season for Chiba Lotte, Sasaki had a 2.27 ERA with 68 strikeouts in 63 1/3 innings.
