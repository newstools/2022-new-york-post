Walt Disney World will no longer require face masks at its Florida properties — the latest in a string of companies to drop their mask mandates this week. Masks are still “recommended” for guests who aren’t fully vaccinated in indoor areas including on transportation and inside theaters, Disney World said on its website Tuesday. “Please note, face coverings are not permitted while experiencing water slides or in the water,” the message added. The sprawling theme parks made masks optional for visitors who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, although masks were still required on transportation like an on-site monorail and bus system. The change in park policy comes a day after the Biden administration dropped its mask mandate for airports, planes and other transportation in the face of a ruling by a Florida judge who questioned the federal guidelines. US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t properly explain the decision to launch a mandate or follow proper protocols. Major airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have since announced that masks would be “optional” on  domestic flights and some international flights. Uber and Lyft announced Tuesday that masks will now be optional for drivers and riders using their service. With Post wires
