A liberal media critic who founded Salon magazine was fatally struck by a NJ Transit train while riding a bicycle, his family said Wednesday. Eric Boehlert, 57, was riding a bicycle near the Watchung Avenue station in Montclair, NJ at around 9:50 p.m. when he was struck and killed by a Hoboken-bound NJ Transit train, according to NorthJersey.com. The seven customers and crew members on board the train were not injured. The NJ Transit Police were conducting an investigation into the crash. Boehlert was remembered fondly by his family, including a wife, Tracy Breslin, and two children. “Through his journalism, social media, books, and appearances on CNN and MSNBC, Eric was a fierce defender of democracy, social justice and truth in media,” his family said in a statement released Wednesday. “He was fearless and brilliant in his investigation of hypocrisies and double standards in the media, and his contribution was priceless.” Boehlert was also a fellow for liberal media watchdog Media Matters and served as a writer for Rolling Stone and Billboard magazine. “Just got crushing news from Tracy Breslin, wife of @EricBoehlert,” tweeted television journalist Soledad O’Brien. “Has died in a bike accident, age 57. Adored his kids Jane and Ben, his dogs, biking and running and basketball and good friends, a fierce and fearless defender of the truth.” Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also weighed in on Boehlert’s death. “.@EricBoehlert’s death is terrible news,” Clinton tweeted. “I’m devastated for his family and friends and will miss his critical work to counteract misinformation and media bias. What a loss.”
