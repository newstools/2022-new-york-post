Masters champion Scottie Scheffler seems to have found a new way to evade household chores. The 25-year-old golfer, who won the 2022 Masters last Sunday, his first-ever major title, recently joked to GolfDigest about how he’s adjusted to having a green jacket now a part of his wardrobe. “I’ve just put it on a few times around the house when trying to mess with Meredith,” Scheffler said of his wife. “When she tries to get me to clean the dishes or something like that, I’ll put the jacket on and be like, ‘Really, I still have to do this?’ I’ve had some fun with her with that.” Scheffler has been married to his high-school sweetheart, Meredith Scudder, since 2020. During last weekend’s tournament at Augusta National, cameras captured Scudder tearing up as Scheffler sealed his Masters win. Scheffler, the world’s No. 1 ranked golfer, finished the final round Sunday at 1-under par and 10-under for the tournament. Once Scheffler sank his final putt, Scudder joined him on the green for a kiss. In an interview Sunday evening, Scheffler spoke about how Scudder encouraged him in the hours leading up to his afternoon tee time. “I cried like a baby this morning,” the New Jersey native recalled. “I was so stressed out. I didn’t know what to do. I was sitting there telling Meredith, ‘I don’t think I’m ready for this. I’m not ready, I don’t feel like I’m ready for this kind of stuff.’ I just felt overwhelmed. “She told me, ‘Who are you to say that you are not ready?’ What we talked about is that God is in control and that the Lord is leading me; and if today is my time, it’s my time.” Scheffler now has four PGA Tour wins to his name. Prior to the Masters, he won the WM Phoenix Open in February, followed by the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, respectively, in March.
