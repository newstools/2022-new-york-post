Five people were shot in front of a Waffle House outside Centennial Park in Atlanta on Saturday night, a report said. Atlanta Police said a fight broke out on Centennial Olympic Park Drive before shots rang out at about 10:00 p.m., according to WSB-TV. Three gunshot victims were found at the scene when cops responded to a report of a shooting. Two other victims carjacked a valet and drove the vehicle to Grady Hospital where they were treated for their wounds, according to CBS 46. Cops recovered three guns and the stolen vehicle. Atlanta Police Deputy Chief Timothy Peek said that his department received 911 calls regarding a group of teens on scooters who may have taken part in the fracas. “We have not had the opportunity to determine whether they were directly involved with this incident but, of course, that will be a part of the investigation,” Peek said. “There were a number of scooters that were on scene when we got here. Now, how they got here and who was using them, we’ll have to figure that piece out.” Police were searching for the gunmen. The condition of those injured was unclear on Saturday night. “What we’ll say is that the investigators are certainly still working in turning over every leaf to determine what happened,” Peek said. “All individuals thus far have been identified. Of course, based off the area surveillance, we will look to see who else we can identify that may have had some involvement with this shooting.” Centennial Park held an Earth Day celebration earlier on Saturday. The event featured yoga, live music, and food vendors. Also, those who attended had the chance to win a free tree.
