A New Jersey firm has recalled more than 60 tons of ground beef due to possible E. coli contamination — which may have affected meat products nationwide. Health watchdogs reportedly discovered the problem during a routine imported product inspection by the US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, per a USDA advisory released Monday. The recall reportedly affected 120,872 pounds of ground-beef products produced by the Swedesboro-based Lakeside Refrigerated Services between Feb. 1  and April 8, according to the warning. The products were reportedly shipped to retailers nationwide. Due to concern that tainted beef may still be in consumers’ refrigerators, the FSIS is urging customers who purchased the flagged goods “not to consume them.” “These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,” the USDA cautioned. The recalled items are sold under the labels Nature’s Reserve, Thomas Farms, Tajima and more. Per the advisory, the recalled products are identifiable by their establishment number “EST. 46841,” which is emblazoned inside the USDA mark of inspection. The USDA has also provided a complete list of the potentially microbe-tainted meats, as well as their product codes and labels. Locating any tainted samples is especially crucial as E. coli infection can cause a host of symptoms, including watery and bloody stools and vomiting, per the advisory. Thankfully, as of yet, there haven’t been any confirmed reports of “illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products,” the alert noted.
