This Great Gatsby-worthy estate is ready for a new landlord. A castle-like mansion in Greenwich, Conn., has hit the market for $39 million. The stunning, 18,954-square-foot manor may appear historic but was actually built in 2001. The sprawling “brick Georgian manor” is accessed via a cherry tree-lined drive which leads to 8.23 “park-like” acres. The grounds feature a 75-foot long heated Haggerty plaster pool with a mosaic floor, pool house with full bath, full kitchen and “expansive” stone terrace, according to the listing. There is also an outdoor kitchen equipped with pizza oven and three grills, a tennis court and five-car garage. Inside, the home has eight bedrooms, nine full baths and four halves. There are eight fireplaces throughout, an elevator, dumbwaiter, custom three-story chandelier, parquet-floored reception hall, bespoke curving staircase and handsome two-story mahogany library with an upper gallery and French doors leading to a covered porch. The primary suite is on the second floor of the north wing and has a private balcony and two radiant-heated bathrooms, the first featuring a marble fireplace and mother of pearl inlay shower and morning kitchen. Up “a short flight of stairs” there’s a wardrobe room and the second bathroom, which has its own dressing room. On the lower level is an “entertainment haven” complete with a wine cellar with capacity for over 5,000 bottles, home theater, game room, full bar and candy concession stand, mirrored dance studio, gym, full batting cage and laundry and power rooms. For those in the market for an actual Connecticut castle and not just a castle-like property, two are currently on the market: Also in Greenwich, the Hemlock Castle — built in 1913 — is currently seeking $11.8 million. Then, in the northeastern portion of the state, a storybook fortress straight out of a fairytale — but built in 2010 — is asking for $60 million.
