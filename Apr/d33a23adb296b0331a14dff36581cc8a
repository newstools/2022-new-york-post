The Utah-Dallas first-round series always projected as one of intrigue for Knicks fans. And apparently it is huge for Knicks brass, too. According to tweets and photos from Dallas’ American Airlines Center, a scouting contingent headed by Knicks executive VP William Wesley attended Saturday’s Game 1 and were even met by Dallas native Julius Randle. Wesley was joined by two other members of the Knicks front office, Allan Houston and Makhtar N’diaye. Randle reportedly joined the executives at halftime. Mavericks point guard Jalen Brunson is a top target this summer as an unrestricted free agent. Jazz star guard Donovan Mitchell would also be a trade target if he looks to get out of Utah if the Jazz are eliminated by the Mavericks. The Jazz won 99-93 behind 32 points from Mitchell. Brunson has 24 points, seven rebounds and five assists for Dallas. It’s unclear if Randle was invited by brass to scout Brunson. But it’s been speculated Randle, who has always excelled in games in his hometown, would consider the Mavericks as a preferred destination if traded.
