Michael Savarino, grandson of recently retired Duke legend Mike Krzyzewski, has entered the transfer portal. This past season, as a junior, Savarino averaged 2.3 minutes and 1.1 points in 11 games. Presumably, he is seeking opportunities elsewhere to pick up some more playing time for his senior year of eligibility. Jeff Goodman of Stadium was the first to report that Savarino is transferring out of the Duke program. In November, Savarino was cited for DWI. Duke star Paolo Banchero was in the car and cited for aiding and abetting DWI. Savarino was suspended for about a month. “We suspended him and punished him,” Krzyzewski said when his grandson returned to the court. “We didn’t put him out and have him flogged in front of everybody, and he still has things to do, legally, but that’s all being done the right way. Just for kids in college, the university and program, we should serve as an umbrella that under that umbrella they have the opportunity to grow. “Obviously we don’t condone what happened. There are a lot of things that happen to kids on campus that we wouldn’t condone, but it happens. You don’t sell them down the river. The only way you get better is by acknowledging that you did something wrong, accepting the punishment and learning from it.”
