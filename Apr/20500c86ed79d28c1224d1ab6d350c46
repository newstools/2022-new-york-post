Michael C. Hall — back as serial killer Dexter after an eight year hiatus — has just sold his West Village digs at a loss. The Golden Globe-winning actor, famed for his life and death obsessed roles in “Six Feet Under,” as well as “Dexter” and “Dexter: New Blood,” bought the two-bedroom, two-bathroom killer condo for $4.28 million in 2016. It just sold for $4.1 million, or a $180,000 loss, according to property records. He had previously listed it as a $15,000 a month rental. The 1,585-square-foot unit at Greenwich Lane, 160 W. 12th St., comes with details like beamed ceilings, hardwood floors, steel entry doors and a chef’s kitchen. But Hall isn’t leaving the city — he bought bigger digs at the El Dorado, where Alec Baldwin once lived, for $4.3 million in 2017. He lives there with his wife, Morgan Macgregor. They married in 2016 following a brief marriage to “Dexter” co-star Jennifer Carpenter back in 2008.
