D’Aundre Holmes-Wilfork, son of former NFL star Vince Wilfork, has pleaded guilty to stealing his father’s Super Bowl rings, among other valuables. Last year, Holmes-Wilfork was arrested in Galveston, Texas for stealing the Super Bowl rings. Other valuables that were reported missing included Wilfork’s AFC Championship rings and his Miami Hurricanes college football championship ring. There was additional missing personal jewelry, including necklaces and earrings. According to ABC 13 in Houston, Holmes-Wilfork, 24, received community service and five years’ probation for pleading guilty to theft of valuables worth more than $300,000. The elder Wilfork initially thought he had misplaced the rings, but investigators discovered that his son had sold them for $62,000. The rings have since been returned to Wilfork. Other items were allegedly pawned by his son, for a total of $4,600. Holmes-Wilfork was kicked off the University of Houston football team in 2016 after he was arrested for drug possession. His attorney told the Galveston Daily News that he has patched things up with his parents. “The outcome that emerged from the case was a result of much self reflection and healing on the defendant’s part and the willingness of his parents to forgive him and show him unconditional love with the sincere hope that he can be rehabilitated and go on to live a happy and productive life,” Holmes-Wilfork’s attorney Mark Aronowitz told the outlet. Wilfork, 40, played in the NFL from 2004 through 2016, spending his first 11 seasons with the Patriots and final two with the Texans. His two Super Bowls with New England came in 2004-05 and 2014-15.
