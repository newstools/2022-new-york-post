The cast of “Seinfeld” paid poignant tribute to its two beloved moms, following the back-to-back deaths of Liz Sheridan and Estelle Harris. Sheridan, famed for playing Jerry Seinfeld’s sitcom mom, died at the age of 93, just over a week after Estelle Harris’s death earlier this month. Leading tributes, Seinfeld took to Twitter to share some heartfelt words about his TV mom. “Liz was always the sweetest, nicest TV mom a son could wish for,” he wrote alongside a picture of the pair. “Every time she came on our show it was the coziest feeling for me. So lucky to have known her.” Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza in the hit sitcom, remembered his own TV mom and wrote: “One of my favorite people has passed – my tv mama, Estelle Harris. “The joy of playing with her and relishing her glorious laughter was a treat. I adore you, Estelle. Love to your family. Serenity now and always.” In a later tweet, Alexander thanked fans for sending their love and memories. “She would be so touched,” he wrote. “As am I. And as she would say, ‘WHY CANT YOU BE MORE LIKE LLOYD BRAUN!!??’” Lloyd, of course, was George’s archrival on “Seinfeld”. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played Elaine, also took to Twitter to remember the late comic icon. “RIP Estelle Harris. I love you. #serenitynow,” she wrote in a tweet. Sheridan starred as overprotective mom Helen Seinfeld in 21 episodes of “Seinfeld” from 1990 to 1998. The star died from natural causes around 2:30 a.m. on Friday, TMZ reports. She is the only “Seinfeld” star — apart from the four main leads — to be featured in all nine seasons of the hit sitcom. Just two weeks prior, Harris died on April 2 of natural causes. She is survived by three children, three grandsons and a great-grandson.
