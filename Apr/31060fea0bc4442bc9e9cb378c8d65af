Police were looking for two goons that cracked a 65-year-old man in the head with a glass bottle on the L train in Brooklyn on Thursday morning. The young men attacked the straphanger with the bottle as the train approached the Montrose Avenue station in Bushwick at 4:20 a.m., the NYPD said. The assailants also punched and kicked the man before fleeing the station, where they were caught on security footage, according to cops. The victim was treated for a minor contusion to his head, police said. The suspects are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s, detectives said. One attacker wore a black snorkel coat with a fur hood, black Adidas sweatpants with white stripes, and black sneakers. The other donned a black jacket, black sweatpants, black boots, and a camouflage ski mask.
