Loved ones and fellow firefighters will gather Thursday to pay their respects to fallen Bravest Timothy Klein. Klein’s viewing will take place from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at McManus Funeral Home, 4601 Avenue N in Flatlands, Brooklyn. The funeral for the 31-year-old hero will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at the Church of St. Francis de Sales, 129-16 Rockaway Beach Boulevard in Belle Harbor, Queens. Klein, a 6-year FDNY veteran and the son of a retired firefighter, grew up nearby in Breezy Point, Queens. He was killed in a raging Sunday afternoon house fire on Avenue N near East 108th Street in Canarsie, officials said. Fire officials say smoke-eaters were battling the fire when flames suddenly swept through the second floor of the building, sending them leaping from windows as part of the structure began caving in on itself. Klein was fatally injured in the structural collapse, according to authorities and sources. Three years ago, Klein gave a eulogy for fellow Bravest Steven Pollard, who died on duty while helping at the scene of a Brooklyn car crash. A woman answering the door at Pollard’s family’s home earlier this week said Steven’s kin would be attending Klein’s funeral. A 21-year-old autistic man, identified as Carlos Richards – the son of a retired NYPD cop – also died in Sunday’s inferno. Richards was reported missing by his family when flames broke out in their home, authorities said. Later Sunday, Richards’ body was found in the home’s charred remains, authorities said. “Our condolences go to the family of the firefighter who died trying to save Carlos,” a man told The Post by phone Monday, after answering a number listed for Richards’ mother. “Our hearts go out to his family. Right now, we’re grieving for Carlos, and we share the same pain that they are feeling,’’ added the man, who did not identify himself.
