The widow of Jackie Kennedy designer Oleg Cassini has filed a $350 million lawsuit alleging  Nassau County officials are trying to “loot” the fashion icon’s $55 million estate. Marianne Nestor Cassini claims the county, Surrogate Court Judge Margaret Reilly, Nassau Public Administrator Brian Curran, the Nassau Sheriff and numerous others want “to get Mrs. Cassini out of the way while they sold-off her and her husband’s property for their own personal profit. This disgraceful, corrupt, and unabashedly illegal conduct must not go without consequence.” In a case that has dragged on for years, the 72-year-old widow has been accused of ignoring court orders and was twice jailed for contempt of court. But she claims those involved have “shamefully” raided the estate by selling off her property and belongings to satisfy judgments against her — including a nearly $51 million charge for improper conduct. Cassini didn’t publicly reveal her marriage to Oleg until after his March 2006 death. One of Oleg Cassini’s daughters, Christina, challenged Marianne’s control of the estate in court, sparking a still unresolved legal fight that saw the widow stripped of her position as administrator. Both of Oleg Cassini’s daughters died without a penny as the estate case has wound its way through court. The state Appellate Division found in February 2020 that Nassau authorities should have given Marianne Cassini more time to find a new lawyer after her first attorney withdrew for medical reasons before a July 2016 trial in the case, and has ordered a new trial. A court spokesman said Reilly was prohibited from commenting. Curran, the public administrator, declined comment. The county and other defendants didn’t return messages.
