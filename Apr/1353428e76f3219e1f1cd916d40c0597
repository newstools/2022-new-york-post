The 2022 NFL Draft should be a big weekend for big men. After ranking the top 10 players at each of the 11 positions over the past two weeks, The Post is now offering our annual Top 100 overall prospects, making comparisons across positions. The draft begins with the 32-pick first round Thursday, 106 players will be selected by the end of the third round late Friday night and another 149 will hear their name called Saturday by the time “Mr. Irrelevant” at pick No. 255 celebrates. The final board — based off of observations and insight gathered in conversations with NFL personnel — suggests that it’s a deep class in the trenches with 18 offensive linemen and 17 edge rushers accounting for more than one-third of the Top 100. League sources suggest a fine line of separation between players taken in the late first round and some of those into the early third round. The Top 100 also includes 14 wide receivers, 12 cornerbacks, nine linebackers, eight safeties, eight defensive tackles, six quarterbacks, five running backs and three tight ends.
