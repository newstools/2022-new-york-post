Frustration is boiling over in Shanghai, as residents increasingly chafe under weeks of draconian coronavirus lockdowns. On Chinese social media Saturday web users fought to share a six-minute video called “The Voice of April.” The footage showed a panorama of the city’s empty streets, while also featuring voices of locals complaining about food and medical shortages that have plagued the metropolis. Netizens, however, faced pushback from China’s army of web censors, who fought all morning to remove the video. Some comments, did manage to survive. “I can only say that if you don’t even want to listen to just a small amount of real voices, then it is really hopeless,” said one dispirited social media user. The city has faced a brutal lockdown in an effort to stamp out the latest wave of coronavirus. Shanghai reported 12 new coronavirus deaths Friday. The average age of the victims was 88 and none were vaccinated. With Post Wires
