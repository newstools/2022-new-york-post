In typical April fashion, severe storms returned to parts of the South late Friday, as a new weather system sweeps from the West into the central and southern U.S. This is not expected to be a repeat of any of the four severe weather outbreaks over the past four weeks, but portions of the storm-weary South might have to contend with at least a few severe thunderstorms in the days ahead. Isolated strong to severe storms developed over parts of Missouri and Arkansas. The storm triggered the issuance of a Tornado Watch for portions of Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee until 12 a.m. CDT. Large hail and gusty winds are the main threats where any thunderstorms develop, but there is a chance a few storms may produce a tornado. On Saturday, thunderstorms might be ongoing in the morning from parts of eastern Oklahoma into the Southeast. This activity could pose an isolated threat for some hail. Storms may then strengthen Saturday afternoon while spreading eastward across the lower Mississippi Valley and portions of the central Gulf Coast, with large hail and damaging wind gusts being the primary concerns. Additional thunderstorms could develop late Saturday afternoon along the dryline in North and Central Texas. These storms will also be capable of producing isolated large hail and damaging wind gusts. There’s another threat of a few severe storms on Sunday in portions of the Southern Plains, lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, particularly to the south of a cold front and to the east of a dryline that will be stretching across those regions. However, the exact areas at risk for severe weather on Sunday are uncertain at this time. Depending on the evolution of this storm system, at least an isolated threat of severe thunderstorms may persist across some parts of the Southeast on Monday.
