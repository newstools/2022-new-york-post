Eddie Coleman, perhaps the final on-air link to the legendary early era of WFAN, is retiring after more than three decades with the station. “I didn’t realize we were going to bury the lede and announce the news on the day Jacob deGrom goes down for four months,” Coleman laughed in a phone conversation with The Post. “I’d like to thank Mets fans over the years for their love and support. They’ve been great to me. I hope I’ve been good to them. I understand I’ve brought them a lot of bad news over the years, in addition to good news, but they never held it against me. It’s been a great run. I came to New York from Boston on July 1, 1987 when the station started. I never thought I’d still be there 30-some-odd years later. The first all-sports radio station. I think we built something really nice, and something strong that’s gonna last. I’m really proud of that.” The news was first reported by Neil Best of Newsday. The Post’s Andrew Marchand added that Brad Heller will be taking over a bulk of Coleman’s New York Mets duties for Audacy – which owns both WFAN, and the Mets’ current flagship station WCBS 880 AM. In that role, Heller will do Mets pregame shows, split postgame shows with Wayne Randazzo and do feature reports on the Mets for WCBS in morning drive. Marchand further reported that Audacy will search for a play-by-play broadcaster to call the 30 or so games where Howie Rose is out. Coleman had been at WFAN since the very early days, in the late 1980s.  He was Mike Francesa’s first ever radio co-host at WFAN, before Francesa joined Chris “Mad Dog” Russo for their long run in afternoon drive.
