A commuter said “I don’t know how I’m alive” after she fainted and fell under a moving train in incredible scenes captured on CCTV. The woman, named only as Candela, lost her balance and tumbled off the platform at Independence Station in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Footage showed Candela becoming unsteady on her feet, tipping forward and stumbling towards the onrushing train. Onlookers feared the worst after she disappeared down a gap between two carriages. Several witnesses were in shock, including two men who can be seen on footage raising their hands above their head in shock. But she was miraculously rescued alive from the tracks after the train stopped. As commuters crowded around, she sat and lied down on the platform before being taken away in a wheelchair to an ambulance. Candela has only just been able to see the images of herself after being told she was out of danger and being discharged from Buenos Aires Hospital Dr Alberto Balestrini. She told an Argentinian TV station: “I suffered a sudden drop in blood pressure and fainted. “I tried to warn the person in front of me but don’t remember anything else, even the moment I smashed into the train. “I don’t know how I’m still alive. I’m still trying to make sense of it all.” A witness to the incident said: “This girl has been reborn. It’s a miracle. “We were waiting for the train and suddenly she fell onto the track. Amazingly it was just a scare.” A woman in Brazil also miraculously survived after being pushed onto the tracks. While a man who survived after falling under a moving train spoke of his trauma after having his arm amputated.
