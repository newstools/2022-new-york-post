What if. Two words that spark such intrigue. A what-if can be considered second-guessing or convenient hindsight, engaging in conjecture as to how the present would be different if you were able to change one incident or decision from the past. The creative geniuses at Marvel, never shy about twisting and bending the reality of the world they create, realized the endless possibilities of tweaking the past with the animated series “What If …?’’ (series description: “Reimagining noteworthy events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and creating a multiverse of infinite possibilities’’). The Giants wish they could reimagine so much of what has recently transpired. They failed to qualify for the playoffs in this universe for the past five years. Taking a shabby offensive line and lackluster play at quarterback into the multiverse might yield similar results, sadly for them. Bad football on a loop.
