Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said late Wednesday that she had reported Jimmy Kimmel to Capitol Police after the late-night host joked on air that Will Smith should slap her. Greene (R-Ga.) tweeted that Kimmel’s wisecrack — which referenced Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars — amounted to a “threat of violence.” “ABC, this threat of violence against me by @jimmykimmel has been filed with the @CapitolPolice,” she tweeted. In response to Greene’s outrage and subsequent police report, Kimmel fired back on Twitter  Wednesday night, writing: “Officer? I would like to report a joke.” Greene then told Kimmel “It’s not a joke,” claiming he purposely incited his audience to threaten her. “your fans called my office today in direct response to you inciting physical violence towards me,” she tweeted. “It’s not a joke. You knew exactly what you were doing.” Kimmel made the quip about Greene on Tuesday night’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after she tweeted that GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitt Romney were “pro-pedophile” for saying they would vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Greene’s comment referenced claims by other Republicans that Jackson had previously let sex offenders off the hook with lenient sentences. During his monologue, Kimmel referred to Greene as a “Klan mom” and said she was “especially upset” by her fellow Republicans’ decision to confirm Jackson. “Wow, where is Will Smith when you really need him?” Kimmel then cracked. Capitol Police didn’t immediately response to The Post’s request for comment.
