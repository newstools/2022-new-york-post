Shots were fired inside a Bronx subway station early Saturday — less than a week after a deranged man opened fire on a rush hour Brooklyn train and left dozens of people hurt. No one was injured when bullets flew inside the West 183rd Street station just before 2 a.m., said police, who added they’re still investigating whether shots were also fired on the 4 train. Three shell casings were found on the northbound 4 train platform, the NYPD said. A man in his 20s with a black backpack and female with a green jacket are being sought in connection with the incident, cops added. On Tuesday morning, 10 people were shot and 19 others hurt when suspected gunman Frank James allegedly set off smoke bombs on the N train at the 36th Street stop in Sunset Park and began shooting, sending terrified straphangers fleeing. James, 62, was captured after a citywide manhunt and is being held without bail on terrorism charges.
