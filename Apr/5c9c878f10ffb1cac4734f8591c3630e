Logan Ryan, the former Giants safety, has filed a grievance against the team, disputing the amount New York owed him after they released him in mid-March, the Post confirmed. The Athletic was first to report the grievance. Ryan, initially signed by the Giants to a one-year contract on Aug. 31, 2020, received a three-year extension worth $31 million late that season, with $5.5 million of his salary for 2022 guaranteed. That is what the Giants paid him when they released him March 18. The grievance comes from the $8.5 million guaranteed for injury. Ryan underwent surgery for a finger injury and wants to recoup that $3 million. Until the grievance is settled, $1.2 million of the disputed money is unavailable for the Giants for salary cap purposes. Ryan, a favorite of former Giants head coach Joe Judge and former Giants defensive coordinator Patrick Graham, quickly found a new football home, reuniting with his one-time Patriots teammate Tom Brady with the Buccaneers.
