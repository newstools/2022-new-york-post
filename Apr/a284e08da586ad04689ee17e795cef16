Two Bronx crooks — one riding a motorcycle – snatched a woman’s handbag and punched her when she tried to grab it back, new video shows. The robbery – the sixth and final incident in an early-morning mugging spree – unfolded on April 20, cops said late Wednesday. The victim was standing near a doorway at Roberts Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard in Pelham Bay when the duo approached and one of them yanked the bag from her clutches, knocking her to the ground, according to police and the footage. When the woman tried to grab her bag back, the motorcycle-riding suspect punched her, again causing her to fall, the video shows. She got right back up and started chasing after the suspect on foot, who was holding the bag, but the pair got away. That same morning, the duo allegedly stole handbags from women on Crotona Park East near Crotona Avenue, Jesup Avenue near Sherif S. Byrd Place, Boston Road near Louis Niñé Boulevard, Archer Street near Leland Avenue, and East 175th Street near Marmion Avenue, police said. The spree began at 1 a.m. and ended at 2:20 a.m., cops said. The suspects allegedly punched five of the six victims – who ranged in age from 23 to 35 – in the face, according to police. Investigators are still working to track them down.
