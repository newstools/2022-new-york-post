The main suspect in the Madeleine McCann case “has not provided German police with an alibi,” a prosecutor has said. Christian Brueckner, 44, was officially named as a suspect in the toddler’s 2007 disappearance on Friday, but has not been charged with a crime. He exercised his right to remain silent when formally questioned by German officials about the night McCann went missing, The Sun reports. Brueckner allegedly told British investigator Mark Williams-Thomas in a new documentary he can prove he wasn’t not around when she was kidnapped, per The Sun. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told the publication, “We’re not aware of any alibi at all. He has not given any information so far — not even via his defense attorney.” Brueckner, referred to as Christian B in Germany due to the country’s strict privacy laws, is currently serving a jail sentence for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same resort where McCann went missing. The three-year-old vanished during a family vacation in the resort of Praia de Luz in Portugal’s Algarve region in 2007. She went missing from the resort on May 3, a few days before her fourth birthday. The toddler’s parents had left their three children sleeping in the apartment while they went to a restaurant nearby, returning regularly to check on McCann and her siblings. But when her mom checked on the kids at 10 p.m., she was horrified to find the door and window to their bedroom wide open and the toddler nowhere to be found. Next month will mark 15 years since McCann disappeared.
