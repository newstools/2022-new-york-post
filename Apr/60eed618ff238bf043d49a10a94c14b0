Three potentially decisive NBA playoff games fill the Thursday card and Monique (The Parlay Queen) of The Action Network has two best bets to share (video above). The first bet that interested Monique on the card is a player prop for Game Six between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors. In that contest, she’s backing Joel Embiid over 27.5 points. Embiid has struggled of late, averaging only 20.5 points in Games Four and Five. But prior to those contests, he surpassed 30 points in Games Two and Three. For Monique, she believes that Embiid is a good candidate to surpass his point total based purely on his shot production. “[Embiid] has a massive advantage over an undersized Raptors roster,” Monique says. “Along with that, I have every single reason to believe his shot attempts will be into the 20’s.” So far this series, Embiid has attempted at least 15 shots in every game and has averaged almost 10 trips to the charity stripe. For those reasons, Monique believes Embiid has a huge game and recovers from (relatively) disappointing performances in the last two games. For her second play, Monique is looking out west to Game Six between the Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz, the latter of which needs to win in order to stave off elimination. In that contest, Monique is backing the first-half total under 108.5 points.  As for why she prefers the first-half over the full game total, it comes down to the fact Monique believes these teams are evenly matched and wants to protect against overtime. But beyond that, Monique believes there are further reasons to like an under. “Both the Mavericks and Jazz play at a slow pace – the Mavericks rank last in the league in possessions/game while Utah averaging only two more per game, putting them 24th,” Monique says. Plus, she expects a league-best Mavs scoring defense to limit the Jazz early, especially in a high-stakes situation.
