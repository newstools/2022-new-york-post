A buyer has emerged for Betty White’s bayfront home, according to a report. Located in Carmel, Calif., the home was put on the market for $7.95 million by White’s estate last week. White died in December, a month short of her 100th birthday. Her estate accepted an offer last week, TMZ reported, though the sale is still pending. Real-estate agents Nicole Truszkowski and Zak Freedman didn’t immediately return messages. White bought the land with her husband, Allen Ludden, in 1978, to be the site of their dream home. But he tragically died of cancer days after moving in. The 3,621-square-foot cliffside home features panoramic views of Carmel Bay. White reportedly wished to spend her final days there — but had to relocate to Los Angeles to be closer to medical care.
