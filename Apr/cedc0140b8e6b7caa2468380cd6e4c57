A woman with big boobs is jealous of those with “cute little” ones – because the size of her bust means she’ll never be able to get nipple piercings. Carly Rivlin took to TikTok to rant about her breasts, and told her followers that she desperately wants to get some intimate piercings herself, but admitted it’s “not on the cards” for her. “Another reason I’m jealous of the girls with the cute little boobs – nipple piercings,” she began. “Nipple piercings sadly are not on the cards for me. “I have to wear a bra and if I didn’t wear a bra, my nipple piercings would be confused for belly button piercings.” Carly added that she’s desperate to wear a “white tank top” that the “jewellery shows through” a little. “I want that so bad,” she concluded. She was quickly praised for her video, with others undergoing similar problems commenting on the clip. “I think about this all the time and it HURTS,” one person wrote. “My girls are southwest and southeast, piercings wouldn’t even be seen,” another added. “omg i’ve found my people,” a third commented. But others insisted Carly should get the piercings if she really wants them done. “Girl do it anyway! Let the girlies hang,” one woman wrote. “My solution for this has been wearing those super tight elasticlike ribbed tops cause they hold the girls alll the way up and my piercings look normal,” another added. Meanwhile, someone else told Carly that she should be thankful she doesn’t have the nipple piercings. “Be happy tho, I have them and if I ever get into cardiac arrest and the paramedics have to defibrillate me, they need to rip the piercings out first because it takes too long to unscrew them,” she wrote.
