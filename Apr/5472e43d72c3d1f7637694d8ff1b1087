Mets first baseman Pete Alonso was hit in the helmet for the second time this season on Tuesday night during the Mets’ 3-0 victory over the Cardinals in St. Louis. With the Mets leading 2-0 in the eighth inning, Alonso was plunked on his helmet fro a changeup by Cardinals right-hander Kodi Whitley. Fortunately for the Amazin’s, Alonso was OK and jogged to first after staring down Whitley for a brief moment. “We’re lucky — you are talking about a pitch that broke his helmet,” manager Buck Showalter said after the game. On April 7 against the Nationals, Alonso was hit by a 94-mph slider from Mason Thompson that grazed his shoulder and hit the helmet flap that protects his face. The flap hit him in the mouth, bloodying the first baseman in a scary scene at Nationals Park. But Alonso didn’t miss any time after that plunking either. Alonso was one of three Mets hit during the game as Dominic Smith and Starling Marte were also plunked. The Mets have had 18 batters hit this season.
