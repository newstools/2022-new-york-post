Laptops have been in the news for some disturbing reasons lately, which might have reminded you that you’re in desperate need for a brand new computer. If a bulky desktop doesn’t fit in your studio apartment, but a sleek MacBook Air isn’t exactly in your budget, you’re in luck. You can snag this refurbished Apple MacBook Air for less than half the price of a brand new model, and also get access to a Microsoft Office Lifetime License to get you up and running with this life-saving bundle, now yours for just $476… 64% off its regular cost.  An Apple MacBook Air is a cult favorite for a reason. This sleek, razor-thin laptop made of lightweight aluminum is easy to take along anytime, anywhere, without taking up much space or hurting your back as you lug it around. Packed with a 54W Li-Poly battery that gives you up to 12 hours of life on a single charge, this MacBook Air makes working on-the-go a breeze. You’ll enjoy an Intel Core i5 1.6GHz processor that lets you browse and stream with a faster and improved CPU and a generous 256GB of storage to keep your photos, videos, and files safe in one place. It’s got a refurbished rating of “B”, meaning it might have light scuffing or light scratches or dents. We don’t always remember that a new laptop means you’ll need a brand new license to the Microsoft Office programs that help you get everything done. Whether you’re a student using Microsoft Word to write an essay, or a professional who depends on Microsoft Teams to keep in touch with their co-workers, the popular Microsoft Office programs are a necessity in 2022.
