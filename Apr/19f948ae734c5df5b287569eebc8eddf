Paul George will not play for the Clippers in Friday’s play-in tournament game against the Pelicans. The 31-year-old entered health and safety protocols on Friday after testing positive for COVID-19, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Friday’s critical matchup will decide the Western Conference’s eighth and final spot in the playoffs. George scored a game-high 34 points against the Timberwolves in the first game of the play-in tournament on Tuesday. He also had seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals. But it wasn’t enough as the LA fell to Minnesota in a 109-104 heartbreaker. Whichever team wins Friday will face the top-seeded Phoenix Suns in the first round. The Clippers lost to the Suns in six games in last year’s conference finals. George, who recently returned to action after suffering a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his shooting elbow in December, averaged 24.3 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in 31 games this season.
