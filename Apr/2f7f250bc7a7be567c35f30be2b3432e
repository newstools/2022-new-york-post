More mail, from Baseball Tim from Frederick, Maryland: “You go Stitches!!! Second week and in the plus column. Keep it going! This is going to be YOUR year. I just have a feeling. Stay focused, and don’t get too excited early on. You know the drill. Not too excited when you win, not too down if you should lose. Keep an even keel. Long season. Marathon. Keep all of this in mind going forward. GREAT to be reading your column again. I am one of your biggest fans!!!” Thank you Baseball Tim. Didn’t realize we were big in Maryland. Whether an Oriole fan or a Nationals fan, yes, it is going be a long season. Stormy weather at Citi Field on Monday. The Mets and Giants will play two on Tuesday. Same bet in Game 1. Take the Mets and Tylor Megill for 10 units. Holding at +2 shamskys.
