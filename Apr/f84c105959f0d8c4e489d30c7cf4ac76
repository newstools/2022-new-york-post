No need to win a presidential election to sit in this Oval Office. All you need is $8.99 million on hand to purchase this listed 24,000-square-foot Maryland estate, located just 21 miles from the White House. In the affluent town of Potomac, and in its Round Hill community, this grand home comes packed with amenities — yes, including a library with curved walls, built-in shelves and a fireplace that resembles a smaller-scale version of the president’s famed office. Set across a 2-acre lot, this for-sale fieldstone property is home to a number of other features, to boot. The main house, itself a 21,000-plus-square-foot mansion, has a full-scale propeller airplane suspended above the billiards room with a wet bar. Meanwhile, a model train chugs along multiple rooms at ceiling level. Elsewhere, there’s a two-story kitchen with marble and teak counters, limestone floors, a breakfast bar and a double-sided fireplace. Also two stories: the great room, which comes wrapped in mahogany paneling and accented with a stone fireplace that reaches the second level. The lower level has a home theater with a 135-inch screen and seats for 21 guests. For more active pursuits, there’s an indoor sports court with space for basketball and foursquare — a well as a gym. There’s also a yoga/spa room. What’s more: The formal dining room can seat 12, and there are a total of 13 fireplaces throughout the property, as well as nine bedrooms — one of which is the master suite with its own deck — and 13 bathrooms in sum. The perks extend outside, too, where there’s a heated — and 40-foot-long — pool with a pool house and a cabana. There’s also a patio, walkways and English-style gardens, plus a garage for five cars. Wendy Banner, of Long & Foster Real Estate, has the listing.
