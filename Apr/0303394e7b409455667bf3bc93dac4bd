Peanut butter and jelly. Strawberries and cream. Salt and pepper. Some things just go better together, and that’s the same case for Adidas and Allbirds — arguably the best shoe brands currently on the market. While they are each individual powerhouses, together, they are unstoppable. Today, April 12, Adidas and Allbirds launch the ADIZERO X ALLBIRDS 2.94 KG CO2E, an evolution of the FUTURECRAFT.FOOTPRINT, which launched last year. But what makes this launch better than the first? Well, each pair only has a carbon footprint of 2.94 kg CO2e and is created with 63% less emissions during production. This brings forth a new method of design and an alternative manufacturing process, while making the new Adidas and Allbirds model a superior low-carbon performance shoe. “Climate change presents a formidable challenge, but the success of this project is an example of how two teams can work together to create a shoe fit for performance and the planet,” said Hana Kajimura, head of sustainability at Allbirds. “Our overarching ambition with this shoe is to inspire others to open up their development processes and cooperate with others to create the most carbon efficient designs possible.” The ADIZERO X ALLBIRDS 2.94 KG CO2E is available in four colorways. You can shop the Core Black and Bliss, Cloud White and Carbon, Core Black and Acid Red colors on adidas.com here and the Allbirds’ exclusive colorway on allbirds.com here. Features include a midsole, tongue and heel made of 17% plant-based sugarcane content and a sockliner made of 46% bio-based sugercane. The outsole is made with 10% recycled rubber while the upper material is made with 77% recycled polyester and 23% natural lyocell. Plus, you can’t forget that the lining, laces and embroidery feature 100%recycled polyester. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
