Who needs a silly, youthful 10 when you can score a sexy, mature 50? Perennial pinups Jennifer Aniston and Elizabeth Hurley are frequently cited as two of the sexiest stars on earth — but there’s a surprise celebrity who gets people even hotter. Kylie Minogue, 53, has been crowned the unexpected winner of a new poll of the most alluring A-listers above the age of 50. The Australian singing sensation beat out British beauty Hurley, 56, and America’s sweetheart Aniston, 53, who placed second and third, respectively. Ourtime — a dating app for singles over the age of 50 — carried out the poll by asking 1,500 of their users to vote on the celebrity they found sexiest. Oscar winner Nicole Kidman, 54, was voted the fourth hottest celeb in the category, followed by British TV presenter Tess Daly, 53. Julia Roberts, 54, clocked in at sixth, while Dame Helen Mirren trailed close behind, proving she’s still sexy at the age of 76. Minogue — who’s been a pop icon for almost four decades — has long been known for her incredibly fit physique and famously had her rear end insured for $4 million. The beauty was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 36, and her health battle played out in the public eye. The “Spinning Around” singer lost her hair during chemotherapy, but she subsequently beat the disease and was hailed a hero when she returned to the stage. Recently, the eternal pop princess told You magazine that she credits her youthful looks to always applying sunblock, saying: “You can’t really stay out of the sun in Australia … but I reapply sunblock all the time, and I’m under the tree with a hat, fully covered.” Minogue has not yet commented on the poll results, but, back in 2014, she said of her sex symbol status: “I’m very comfortable with it I believe I found my place. That right zone between not being too far over the line and just being representative of myself.” Meanwhile, super-hot Hurley has been on the minds of many Ourtime voters thanks to her very sexy Instagram account. The “Austin Powers” actress became known for her lockdown photo shoots, frequently flaunting her incredible body in an array of skimpy bikinis in her backyard. “I have my own swimwear line,” Hurley explained, saying she wanted to push her beach brand during the pandemic. “I wouldn’t ordinarily be prancing around in quite so much beachwear, so there is a reason behind prancing around in so many swimsuits.” “We haven’t been allowed to go on vacation in 14 months,” she continued. “I have a beachwear company and haven’t been on the beach … Hence, we have been selling what we can. We’ve been improvising.” Meanwhile, Hurley recently credited her age-defying figure to the fact that she hasn’t “eaten processed food for 100 years.” “I don’t eat sweets. I drink little alcohol. I don’t smoke but I deeply regret that I once did. I have learned to eat lighter and not so late,” the mom-of-one told UK’s Sunday Times. Third-place Jennifer Aniston has similarly spilled her anti-aging secrets. The “Friends” alum has won a legion of fans for looking far younger than her 53 years. Aniston revealed that she’s been using Aveeno’s Daily Moisturizing Lotion every day since she was a teenager, saying: “I have a bottle in my car. It’s in all of my bathrooms. Put it on right out of the shower before you get too dry.” The beauty also refuses to go gray, having her hair dyed every five weeks. Meanwhile, her ultra-fit frame comes courtesy of boxing coach Leyon Azubuike, with whom she trains at Gloveworx gyms in Los Angeles. Competition for the title was certainly stiff given that many A-listers are looking better the older they get. Supermodels Naomi Campbell, 51, Cindy Crawford, 56, and Christie Brinkley, 68, have all been wowing fans on social media in their bodycon outfits and bikinis. Meanwhile, Demi Moore, 59, Jennifer Lopez, 52, and Salma Hayek, 55, have also been showing off in swimwear. But stunning supermodel Paulina Porizkova — who is 57 and frequently poses topless — last year told Page Six that ageism is still prevalent. “I think we’ve made enormous strides in accepting all different sorts of beauty,” she said. “But age, ageism, that’s kind of like the last frontier.” However, red hot Helen Mirren is one of the stars helping to change perceptions, this week gracing People magazine’s “Most Beautiful” issue. The outspoken actress, who turns 77 in July, says she’s still got “swagger” in her senior years. “I love the word ‘swagger’ because I think swagger means I’m confident in myself, I’m presenting myself to the world, I’m enjoying the world around me,” she stated. “I think what is called the beauty industry should be called the swagger industry. We’re giving people swagger.” The “Woman in Gold” star has previously spoken out about wanting to change the definition of “sexy,” saying in 2016: “I mean, by ‘sexiness,’ do you mean that men want to f–k you? Is that what it means fundamentally? Otherwise, we’re talking about interest or chic or elegance or personality. There’s a lot of other words to use.” Meanwhile, Ourtime users were also polled on the sexiest male celebrities over the age of 50. George Clooney, 60, came in at the top spot, ahead of Brad Pitt, 58, who still managed to make women swoon when showed off his rippling six-pack abs in 2019’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Hugh Jackman, 53, came in third place. However, the voters are unfortunately unlikely to meet most of the sexiest celebs on the Outrime dating app, as they are almost all off the market. Of the mentioned A-listers, only Aniston, Hurley and Pitt currently appear to be single. 1. Kylie Minogue, 53                2. Elizabeth Hurley, 56 3. Jennifer Aniston, 53           4.
