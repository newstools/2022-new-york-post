The Vikings reportedly haven’t ruled out trading up in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft on Thursday. Minnesota, which has the No. 12 overall pick in the draft, has considered a potential trade-up situation for defensive end Travon Walker or cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner, according to The Athletic. That is, if Walker — the current favorite to go No. 1 to the Jaguars — or Gardner falls down the board. Unless the Vikings are willing to give up their second-round pick, the earliest they could move up would be pick No. 8, The Athletic noted, adding that Minnesota is more likely to trade back. The Vikings have been keen on Walker leading up to the draft and reportedly brought him in for an interview last month. But Minnesota is in desperate need of a cornerback, despite re-signing eight-time Pro Bowl corner Patrick Peterson in the offseason. They still need secondary pieces to round out their defense. If unexpected moves go down in Las Vegas, where the 2022 NFL Draft kicks off Thursday night, the Vikings could make a surprising play.
