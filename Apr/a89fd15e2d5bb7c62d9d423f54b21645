A man accused of killing a Queens nurse he met on a dating app was extradited to New York City from California Thursday to face a murder charge in the nearly 4-year-old case, police said. Danueal Drayton, 31, was hauled to a Queens Village police station and charged in the strangulation death of Samantha Stewart, 29, who was found dead at her Jamaica home on July 17, 2018, police said. Drayton also faces charges including grand larceny, identity theft and  sexual misconduct, according to the NYPD. Drayton had an alleged history of violence against women that he met online, in both the tristate area and in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was charged with strangling his ex-girlfriend on Long Island a month before Stewart’s murder, but was released on his own recognizance at the time, according to Nassau County prosecutors. Hours after Stewart’s death, Drayton allegedly raped and choked a woman he had met on Tinder in Sunset Park, police said. Drayton then fled to Los Angeles, where he was accused of the forcible rape and premeditated attempted murder of a California woman. Police caught up with Drayton a week after the Queens murder in a North Hollywood hotel room, where he was holding a woman against her will, police said.
