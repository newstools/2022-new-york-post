Howls of outrage started rising long before Twitter’s board finally accepted Elon Musk’s $44 billion offer to buy the company — a huge sign of how important the sale could prove. On one level, it’s no shock: The board members’ only real alternative was a flagrant violation of their fiduciary duty. But it’s a striking setback to the forces of woke censorship and a win for the free exchange of ideas and information. The world’s richest man has come out strongly against the ideology animating Twitter’s efforts to suppress opinion its employees dislike and facts that hurt their favored causes. You can take our word for it. Our 100% accurate (and now New York Times-approved) reporting on the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop got us banned from Twitter in the runup to the 2020 election, greasing the wheels for papa Joe. So we’ve been watching this development ever since Musk’s March 27 tweet warning that Twitter’s “failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.” Assuming Twitter will soon “adhere to free speech principles,” this is a clear win for democracy. And while we can’t say how the business side will work out, Musk’s track record is pretty impressive. And it’s sure going to be fun to watch.
