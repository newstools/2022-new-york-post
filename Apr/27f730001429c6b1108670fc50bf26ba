Michael Bay doesn’t “really care” about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars. Bay, who directed Smith in “Bad Boys” and “Bad Boys II,” was not watching the 2022 Oscars live, but was flooded with texts about the incident. “I wasn’t watching. I saw it. First of all, it’s wrong to begin with,” Bay told Yahoo! Entertainment. “I don’t really care. Hollywood gets very self-absorbed. There are babies getting blown up in the Ukraine right now. We should be talking about that. I really don’t care.” Bay added, “I’ve worked with him. He’s not that guy. I’ve never seen him lose his cool like that. I thought it was a setup because I saw his smirk. I’ve been on set when Will has screwed with people and joked with people.” “It was a slap. Not a punch. He’s very good at fighting, he’s trained at that. It’s wrong to begin with. Then I knew the yell… he was mad.” The “Transformers” director was asked about the slap while promoting his new movie “Ambulance,” which opens in theaters on April 8. Smith has since apologized to Rock in an Instagram post, saying his actions were “unacceptable and inexcusable.” He also announced his resignation from the Academy following the outburst, and the Academy promised a formal disciplinary review.
