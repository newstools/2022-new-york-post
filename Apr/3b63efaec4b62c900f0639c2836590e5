We’re turning up the heat on this super cool deal. To get the Amazon Smart Thermostat while it has the hot new price tag, read on. The Amazon device is now on sale for 20% off now through April 23 while supplies last. If the beginning of this month showed us anything about New York weather, it’s that one day can be a nice 70 degrees and the next is a chilly 35 — just another reason why having an easy-to-use thermostat is so important. To give some specs, the Amazon Smart Thermostat can be set up in just 45 minutes, with help from Alexa, of course. She also comes in handy once all set up, as you can use the Alexa app on your devices to control the temperature in your home remotely, even when not physically at home. The thermostat is also run by Honeywell, so you know the tech is reliable to heat and cool efficiently. Speaking of efficiency, it is also ENERGY STAR® certified and a great choice for the environment as well as your energy bills. “Amazon Smart Thermostat is ENERGY STAR® certified. Certified thermostats are required to save an average of $50 on yearly energy bills,” reads the product page. “Check with your energy provider about available energy savings rebates to save on your purchase. Plus, eligible customers can enroll in ongoing energy savings incentives with their energy provider to keep saving all year long.
