Tiger Woods’ miraculous comeback at Augusta may not have had a storybook ending, but it was a highly profitable weekend nonetheless. The Titleist 681-T iron set that he used to win four straight majors (The Tiger Slam) sold for over $5 million at auction. Stitch Nation President Don Reed wonders “what the Woods-used steering wheel would go for.” The Blue Jays fly into The Bronx on Monday. Toronto picked up its first loss Sunday after taking two from the Rangers. Alek Manoah comes off an outstanding rookie year that saw him go 9-2 in 20 starts. The Jays are loaded with live bats so a sophomore jinx (in terms of wins and losses) is highly unlikely. The Yankees played the Sunday nighter after playing longball to win the first two games against the Red Sox. Jameson Taillon makes his first start after going 8-6 in 29 appearances last year. Play 10 units on the Jays. The Giants fried the Fish 3-2. San Francisco was outhit 11-6 but its bullpen pitched 5 ¹/₃ shutout innings. Win has us at -38 schefflers.
