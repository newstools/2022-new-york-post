If you’ve ever wanted to match your pajamas to your bed sheets, you’re about to be overwhelmed with great news. Why do you ask? Because J. Crew has officially launched their limited-edition home collection. In collaboration with the famed British print house, Liberty (est. 1875), J. Crew brings duvet covers, table linens, fun prints and more to the forefront. “J.Crew and Liberty work closely on our seasonal prints within clothing items, so we were excited to extend that partnership into home pieces,” said Olympia Gayot, Head of Women’s Design at J. Crew. “Liberty’s prints are the essence of all that they do, and are so inspiring themselves, we wanted to bring this to life with the collection.” Shoppers can also look forward to four various floral patterns that each posses unique personality. “The beauty of this collection is that it can live beyond your home — bring the table pieces to your outdoor tablescape or let it inspire the flower arrangement, and use the bedding as a spring refresh,” said Gayot.
