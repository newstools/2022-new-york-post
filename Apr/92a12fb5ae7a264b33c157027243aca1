The Rangers will not be the winners of the Metropolitan Division, but they are cemented in the second spot. Friday’s regular-season finale against the Capitals does not hold much significance and the Blueshirts will certainly be resting many key players. They will now await their fate: Washington Capitals or Pittsburgh Penguins. Who presents the better matchup for the Rangers to move on to the second round? That’s the $64,000 question on the latest episode of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Ron Duguay and Mollie Walker. The Post’s Larry Brooks is back to break down the playoff road ahead for the Rangers. We also answer questions from Post Sports+ members.
