A man who was struck in the head during a double Brooklyn shooting over the weekend has died, cops said. Kevin Alves, 38, was standing in the lobby of a building on Bergen Street near New York Avenue in Crown Heights just before 1 a.m. Saturday when an unknown assailant shot him in the head, police said. A 45-year-old man who was also in the lobby was shot in the torso and grazed in the ear, cops said. Both men were taken to the Kings County Hospital Center, where Alves – who lives about two blocks from the scene – succumbed to his injuries, authorities said. The 45-year-old man was listed in stable condition. No arrests had been made by Monday morning. The circumstances leading up to the deadly gunplay remained unclear Monday.
