Here are some notable nuggets that happened during Yankees’ spring training action on Monday: The Yankees used much of the heart of their bullpen in the 5-2 win over the Phillies, with Lucas Luetge, Wandy Peralta, Clay Holmes, Chad Green, Jonathan Loaisiga and Aroldis Chapman each pitching an inning. Only Luetge gave up a run. Jasson Dominguez, who will start the year at Low-A Tampa, was scheduled to make his first Grapefruit League appearance off the bench, but he was scratched due to a stomach bug. Giancarlo Stanton showed off his arm in right field. A strong throw home on a fly ball by Matt Vierling nearly got Mickey Moniak in the third. And in the fifth, he threw out Jean Segura on an Alec Bohm base hit. The Yankees close out spring training at Steinbrenner Field against the Tigers at 1:05 p.m.
