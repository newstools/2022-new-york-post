A Northwell Health employee was killed after he was shot in a parking garage outside of a healthcare facility in New Hyde Park on Thursday afternoon, according to hospital officials. According to a statement from Northwell Health, the unidentified employee was killed in the publicly-accessible garage at 1999 Marcus Avenue, where a collection of physician offices and specialty care practices are located. Several team members rendered aid at the scene before the victim was transported to a local hospital and pronounced dead, the hospital said. Nassau County Police could not confirm the fatal shooting, but told The Post there was an ongoing investigation in New Hyde Park at the same address following an incident around 4:15 p.m. Northwell said it is offering counseling services to team members at the scene and “mourns the heartbreaking loss of our colleague and team member.”
