MLB bettors have 20 sides to choose from on Thursday’s betting board, but two sides in particular are catching meaningful betting attention. The Action Network PRO Report designates five factors — sharp money, big money, PRO systems, model edge and expert picks — to help distinguish certain plays from others available. A number of sides trigger two of the above signals today, but only two hit a majority of the five factors. Which two? Take a look below. The Rangers actually opened as +110 home underdogs, but this represents the best price available on the hosts. In terms of its three signals, though, the first is that the Rangers have received a good chunk of big money bets from sharp bettors. As it stands, the AL West squad has received only 25 percent of all moneyline bets, but 45 percent of the total handle. Additionally, Action Network model projections suggest this Rangers side is a tad undervalued Thursday. According to our MLB power ratings, Texas should only be a +111 underdog to the Angels, so bettors are getting about 25 cents of value with this price. Finally, one top Action Network MLB analyst is choosing to back the rangers tonight, rounding out the three signals going in its favor. Interestingly, sharp action has hit the host Dodgers tonight, but three of the remaining four go in favor of the visiting Reds. Big money bets have mostly gone toward Cincinnati, which has received 15 percent of all moneyline bets and 38 percent of the total moneyline handle. Plus, one Action Network PRO system — the “Contrarian Betting Against Good Teams” system — triggers the Reds tonight. That system, which essentially chooses to go against good teams that are receiving a majority of bets and are on a small losing streak, has a 41 percent historical win percentage and a 10 percent return on investment. Finally, one top MLB expert from the Action Network is backing the Reds tonight, giving the visitors three of a possible five signals.
