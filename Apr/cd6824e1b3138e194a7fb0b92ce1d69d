A Florida man was hoisted to safety on a helicopter after he fell out of a canoe and became hopelessly lost in dense forest for two days, authorities said. Davidson Anjab, 39, was out on a canoe with two pals near Altoona on Sunday when it suddenly capsized and the trio tumbled into the water, Lake County Sheriff’s Office said. While his friends were able to climb back in, Anjab couldn’t make it to the canoe and instead swam to a nearby shoreline. He yelled to his friends that he would meet them at their launch point. But Anjab never made it back and lost his way in a thick forest, officials said. The sheriff’s office launched a search operation for Anjab that included K-9 and helicopter units along with a “mounted posse.” After roughly 40 hours in the punishing wilderness, Anjab was located by police units who called in a helicopter from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Aviation Unit to lift him out of the remote area. Video of the operation shows Anjab and several officers waving up to the helicopter crew before a rescuer lowers himself down, attaches himself to the stricken man and lifts him up to safety. “He was transported to an area hospital where he will receive fluids and medical attention as he recovers from being out in that environment for roughly 40 hours,” the department said in a statement. Officials credited volunteers and multiple agencies for the successful rescue. “This was a team effort and we couldn’t be more grateful!” the sheriff’s office wrote on Facebook. “Wishing Mr. Anjab a speedy recovery!”
