For those that have been planted on the couch working from home or those rooted to the office cubicle, we have a green gift for you. To help brighten up your office space, Plants.com is offering 20% off their selection of office plants. Use code OFFICE20 at checkout to cash in on this deal, but make sure to act fast, as this deal wilts away on April 24. Plants not only make an office feel more lively, but some can even help improve air quality, which is great when working in a co-working environment during the pandemic, especially. Plants.com offers air-purifying plants, as well as others like bamboo and bonsais for your desk, floor plants for the common areas and even pet-friendly plants for the office dog. Prices start at just $23 before the discount and many plants range in size from small to large, with options to select your planter to match your office aesthetic. They also make great gifts for bosses or coworkers, with or without a green thumb if you choose a low-maintenance option like a succulent or bamboo. Be sure to shop now, as the sale only runs until April 24 and by then spring will have already sprung and be in full bloom. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
