“REAL Housewives Of New York” alum Jill Zarin is in contract to sell her Boca Raton, Fla., home after listing it in January for $2.29 million. The four-bedroom, three-bathroom home at 5853 Hamilton Way is in contract to sell for $1.99 million, Zarin said. At 2,871 square feet, it comes with lake views. The listing brokers are Debra Hofmann, of Palace Real Estate, and Elliot Koolik of Compass. Even though Zarin bought a bigger, 6,609-square-foot home nearby that had been asking $3.49 million, she now tells Gimme that she has her sights on Miami. That’s where she recently eyed an 80th-floor condo at the Waldorf Astoria Residences that is on the market for $8.67 million. The 100-story tower, at 300 Biscayne Blvd., has a 2025 slated completion date. The 3,575-square-foot home features four bedrooms. There’s also an outdoor terrace with a summer kitchen. The building will feature 360 residences while the property will have a pool, an outdoor café, a private bar/wine tasting room, a spa and more. “It might be time for me to consolidate my real estate,” Zarin told Gimme, adding that buying and selling residential real estate has become a passion and that she loves living in her investments. Zarin also has a home in New York and a Sag Harbor condo, as we previously reported. She’s been busy growing Jill & Ally — Ally being her daughter — which launched during the pandemic with masks and now makes crystal manifestation candles as well. The listing broker of the Waldorf condo is Erin Sykes of Nest Seekers.
