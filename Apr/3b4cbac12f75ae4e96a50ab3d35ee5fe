There’s no official record of this spooky sale — because it happened in an off-market deal. “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” actor Christopher Meloni — the “zaddy” known for playing NYPD Detective Elliot Stabler for the first 12 seasons of the hit NBC legal drama — has sold his allegedly haunted Hollywood Hills home to Rawson Marshall Thurber, the director of 2021’s “Red Notice” action flick as well as 2004’s “Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.” Thurber, 47, paid $5.9 million for the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in an off-market deal, Dirt reported. Built in 1916, the gated half-acre property boasts a separate guest house, center hall, living room fireplace, pool and an otherworldly tenant: The ghost of actor Ozzie Nelson. Nelson — who is best known for co-starring in the sitcom “The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet” with his wife Harriet from 1952 to 1966 — died of liver cancer in the house in 1975, aged 68. After his passing, the home changed hands multiple times and owners began sharing similar stories of model train sets running on their own in the night, the scent of rosy perfume inexplicably appearing out of nowhere and doors opening by themselves, Yahoo has previously reported. “We heard that Ozzie[‘s ghost] used to have ice cream at night,” a listing agent for the home told Yahoo when it was on the market  in 2014 but “that’s not true any longer” as Ozzie’s spirit apparently left after a $3 million “East Hamptons”-style remodeling in 2013. Meanwhile, in New Canaan, CT, 61-year-old Meloni’s notably un-haunted former 14-room Colonial property recently also changed hands. The “not at all” possessed property features a garage fit for an up to six-car vehicle collection, a sprawling barn and “beautiful windows that look out to the property” listing agent Sheila Clemente told The Post. A deal closed on the property, which was listed for $4.995 million, in Jan. Meloni sold the property for $4.3 million back in 2015, according to the Stamford Advocate.
