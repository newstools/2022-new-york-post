Jada Pinkett Smith’s former sweetheart is singing like a canary. August Alsina, the R&B vocalist with whom Pinkett Smith, 50, admittedly shared an extramarital “entanglement,” appears to be exhuming the twisted details of their since-bedded relationship in a new song, “Shake the World.” “Well, of course some s – – t is bound to go down when you tangled up with the world’s favorite,” Alsina, 29, sings on the track, which he teased via his verified Instagram profile Monday. His controversial lyrics come amid the chaos sparked by Pinkett Smith’s husband of nearly three decades, Will Smith, 53, who infamously slapped comedian Chris Rock, 57, for teasing the actress about her short hair during the Oscars on March 27. Elsewhere in the ditty, Alsina — who forged an extremely close and public bond with Pinkett Smith in 2015, and openly confessed to their romantic relationship in 2020 — also makes reference to getting canceled after the leading lady confirmed their affair, alongside a crestfallen Smith, on her Facebook series “Red Table Talk,” in July 2020. “I heard I was canceled,” croons the musician on the track. “Well, let’s not speak on that. Red dot on my back, I became a target. And I’m flawed but flawless, that’s what makes me August.” Digital detectives on Twitter were immediately able to decode Alsina’s not-so-cryptic lyrics, and are calling him out for reigniting the old flames of his and Pinkett Smith’s fling. “If, August Alsina, don’t let that entanglement GO! Damn! That’s probably why she ain’t f – -king with you now talking like a Barbie!,” scolded one cyber naysayer. “I said it once & I’ll say it again. August Alsina moving like a hurt side chick,” agreed another. “Anybody still feeling sorry for him is stupid. He knew what he was doing & he spoke out with ill intentions because Jada went back to Will. Point blank period.” So far, neither Smith nor Pinkett Smith has commented on Alsina’s latest release.
