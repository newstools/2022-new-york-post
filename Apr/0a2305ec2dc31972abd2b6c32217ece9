The James Madison University softball team is mourning the death of their star catcher, Lauren Bernett. The university’s athletic department announced the tragic news Tuesday, but did not list a cause of death for the 20-year-old sophomore. Bernett’s teammates shared heartfelt tributes on social media, including Dukes infielder Jasmine Hall, who tweeted a video that showed the pair sitting in a car together, singing “The Truth” by Jason Aldean. “Lauren, You have made such a big impact on this team not only as a player but as a person,” Hall tweeted. “I am so thankful that you were put in my life, and I will always cherish the time I had with you on the field and off the field. I love you forever and always. Fly high sweet girl.” Emily Phillips, a catcher and outfielder for the JMU softball team, tweeted, “Words can’t describe the friendship we had and how much it meant to me! You had my back no matter the time of the day. From us jamming to country music, late night roomie talks, to our catcher chats. I’m going to miss you more than anything. Fly High, 22.” Alyssa Humphrey, a junior pitcher for the Dukes, tweeted a collage of photos with Bernett, writing, “Forever my best friend. I love you endlessly LB,” with a white heart emoji. JMU softball’s home series against Delaware this weekend has been canceled, the team tweeted Wednesday. A memorial location will remain set up at the JMU Softball Veterans Memorial Park entrance, according to the school’s athletic department. The university provided students with information for its counseling center and other mental health resources in its statement. Bernett, a McDonald, Penn. native, is survived by her parents, two brothers and two sisters.
