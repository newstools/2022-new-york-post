A Colorado man was found guilty Tuesday of strangling his wife to death in the shower before staging the scene to make it look like an accident. A jury handed down a first-degree murder verdict against Robert Feldman, 58, after just two hours of deliberation, prosecutors said in a press release. Feldman’s 44-year-old wife, Stacy Feldman, was found dead in the shower of their Denver home in 2015. But Robert wasn’t arrested until 2018 — after a woman he had an affair with went to police with her suspicions, according to local reports. The judge in the case imposed a life sentence without possibility of parole, the district attorney said. “Despite his creative efforts to evade justice, today Robert Feldman was found guilty of murdering his wife, Stacy Feldman,” Denver DA Beth McCann wrote. “I am extremely proud of the outstanding work by our prosecutors, investigators, victim advocates, support staff, and the Denver police detectives who never gave up on securing justice for Stacy.” After the murder, prosecutors said Robert picked up their two young children from school an hour late and took them to a carnival before telling police he found his wife unresponsive in the shower, according to The Denver Post. The husband told police that she dropped dead from a medical condition. The coroner did not immediately rule the death a homicide, and it was not investigated by police until months later, when detectives reportedly learned of Robert’s infidelity from his paramour, who read Stacy’s obituary and noticed the woman died on the day she tipped her off to the affair, 9 News reported. Robert had collected $750,000 in life insurance from Stacy’s death, and he used more than two thirds of it to pay for a high-priced defense lawyer, despite legal challenges from her family, who argued the money should go to their children.
