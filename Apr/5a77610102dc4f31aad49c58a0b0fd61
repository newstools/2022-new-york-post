Five family members and a dog were found dead in a Minnesota home Wednesday after police received a report of a man experiencing a mental health crisis. The bodies were found after cops in Hermantown got a request to conduct a welfare check of a man in crisis around 11:30 a.m., officials said. The investigation led police to nearby Duluth where the bodies were found. The mentally unstable man, who “had access to weapons,” was among the dead, according to police. It was not immediately disclosed how the victims died, how they were related or who was responsible. Police said they were not looking for suspects and that there was no threat to the community. The apparent massacre was an “unimaginable tragedy” that “is very, very difficult for us,” Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said, according to WDIO-TV. “It makes us have heavy, heavy hearts,” Tusken said.
