They’re Penn pinchers. The University of Pennsylvania is suing an alum who skipped out on $3,361.01 in tuition 11 years ago. Morgan Griff, 33, graduated from Penn in 2011, but still owes an amount that would barely pay a semester meal plan these days, according to the Ivy League institution’s Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit. The sum is small potatoes to Penn, whose endowment totaled $20.5 billion as of 2021. But it shouldn’t be an issue for Griff either, since he’s an executive director at Japanese financial conglomerate Nomura, according to LinkedIn. It’s a job that pays an average of about $235,000 per year — plus another $150,000 in bonuses and stock, according to workplace reviewer Glassdoor. The former Sigma Chi fraternity brother lives on the 50th floor of a luxury building in Tribeca last listed for $6,420 per month, records show. Neither Griff, nor his alma mater, returned messages.
