The Rising Star actor Matthew McNulty details his spooky supernatural experience in a haunted hotel. Matthew, 39, plays Tom Rees the estranged father of murdered teenager Neve Kelly in the crime drama. Talking about his unusual experience, Matthew began: “One time I was in a hotel half an hour from Galway in the middle of nowhere on the West coast of Ireland, which was known for being haunted. “I’d had a few drinks, went to bed and I had a vision of an old guy. “First he sat on the bed and then he peed in the wardrobe. “I was like, ‘What are you doing?!’ Then I woke up. “It was just a very vivid, real dream, alcohol-induced but I guess there might be a little something in that. “At least it wasn’t me that peed in the wardrobe. I did check.” Matthew described Tom as “a complex character. He’s got loads of layers and sharp edges and broken pieces. His soul!” The drama follows Tom’s relationship with Neve (Clara Rugaard) who haunts him from beyond the grave to try to find her killer. The actor revealed: “I think because of the drink Tom has probably failed Neve a lot of times. “At the start of the story he has guilt for not being there when he should have and for not being the dad that he probably wants to be. “Rather than trying to be better he just wallows in self-pity but because Neve is so laser focused and so astute and intelligent and this force of nature she hasn’t got time for that.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
