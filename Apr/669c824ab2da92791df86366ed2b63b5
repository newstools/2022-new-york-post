A 60-year-old man was bludgeoned with a brick in broad daylight on a Harlem street last week, new video shows. The victim – who lives in a building on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard near West 132nd Street – confronted a woman who he believed was stealing packages in the lobby around 3 p.m. Thursday, police said. The woman then left and returned with two other people – one of whom beat the victim with a brick and repeatedly pummeled him in the middle of the street until he fell to the ground, video released late Monday shows. The victim was taken to Harlem Hospital in stable condition, with severe lacerations, and the attacker took off. No arrests had been made by Tuesday morning.
