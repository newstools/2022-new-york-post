Sure, Mother’s Day is filled with flowers, tea and unique kitchen gadgets she’ll love. But, if you want the full-throttle of unique Mother’s Day gifts to show your appreciation, you’ve come to the right place. Here at New York Post Shopping, we’re here to corral our favorite products we reviewed and top-tier items we’ve researched into a one-stop edit of the best of the best — on Amazon. Amazon, otherwise known as the retailer that sells everything (literally, everything), has a slew of best-selling products and hidden gems on its page. Whether you’re on the market for that new skincare essential for mom or a quality cookware set, Bezos never lets anything fall through the cracks. For all your shopping — mom, wife, grandma, aunt, sister and any mother in your life who you hold dear — we put together the 25 best Mother’s Day gifts on Amazon you can shop well before the big holiday. It’s not just any gift guide, it’s the hot-button list we recommend IRL. We’re starting off with a bang (or rather, a blow-out). We love Revlon’s best-selling One-Step Volumizer so much, we wrote a full review on it. Not only is it well-priced at under $40, but it helps achieve a salon-like look from the comfort of your own home. Listen up, y’all — cuz this is it. Olaplex’s massively followed shampoo and conditioner just had a reformulation and is back and better than ever (also, it’s one of our favorite shampoos we tried). For a treat mom wouldn’t splurge on herself, this is a great bundle. If you consider your mom to be a bit of a book lover (who can’t stop listening to the top audible books), a modern Kindle Paperwhite will serve her well. It’s one of our favorite e-readers and smart home devices, too. After burning many candles in our home, there’s no other than Lulu Candles. We can’t believe how affordable they are (number one) and how this Espresso Bean scent makes your space smell like a rich-aromatic coffeehouse (number two). Go buy it (and thank us later). It’s never too late to hop on the UGG train. Specifically, its Fluff Yeah Slide Slipper deserve all the acclaim in the world, much ado to their smooth-walking feel and breathable design. Oh, and did we mention they come in a limitless amount of colors? As one of our favorite brands for affordable fine jewelry, Kendra Scott wins the award for Cutest Earrings Ever. Pick up a pair for mom (and yourself, why don’t ‘cha), and you’ll be feeling put-together and supremely styled. Plus, these hanging ones come in a few different hues. Not to be dramatic, but robot vacuums changed our lives (read our vacuum review for more). As a consistent Amazon best-seller, we couldn’t resist adding the iconic iRobot Roomba 692 to our list of What to Get Mom. It also pairs with an app, so she can cook or paint her nails while the house is becoming spick and span (how great is that)? If the mother you know is into pilates or is all about fitness, Bala Bangles are one of the buzziest essentials to snag right now. Available in a slew of colors, these wrist and ankle weights can elevate your workouts (perhaps with a rowing machine or a treadmill) and can even be worn while folding laundry for some extra toning. If we had a dollar for every time we used our Nespresso Vertuo Plus — well, we’d be rich. Yes, this machine is worth all the attention it’s been given, especially when you buy this bundle that comes with the popular Aeroccino Milk Frother for truly elevated lattes. As one of our favorite work totes our readers love to buy, this classic carry-all has a snazzy tassel for decoration, petite gold hardware for accessorizing and a wide capacity that can fit your laptop. It comes in four other natural colors, too. Feeling sentimental this Mother’s Day? If words are mom’s love language, she’ll appreciate this heartfelt flip-through of fill-in pages full of memories and gratitude. You can’t put a price on happiness this Mother’s Day, though $10 is sweet enough. Gift the mother-figure in your life a luxe pajama set she’ll wear all year round. This soft cream never goes out of style, with the black detailing giving it a Bloomingdale’s or Saks Fifth Avenue lean. For the mom who appreciates all things practical, the Oral-B 1000 CrossAction is one of the best dentist-recommended electric toothbrushes we rounded up. Coming in black and white, it helps remove 300% more plaque for that fresh, professional feel. Again, not to be dramatic but Drybar’s High Tops Self-Grip Rollers have completely transformed how we style our hair. They’re heatless (like those TikTok-famous curlers) and give your hair unmatched volume and shape. Buy now, thank us later. We’re impressed that a name like Tahari has a less-than-$35 plush robe that’s perfect for stepping out of your shower with or getting ready in. It also comes in gray and is the perfect staple for mom she’ll love for years. For more options, check out our guide to the best robes. There’s no surprise Cosori’s Air Fryer is one of Amazon’s best-sellers (and, one of our favorite air fryers of the year). Clad with a recipe book, it’s simple to use and looks pretty on your counter — all while cooking up some fabulous eats. If mom loves to entertain, this all-in-one bamboo cheese board is the way to go. For all things charcuterie, it’s second to none, and can even double as a cutting board for a quick slice and dice. Not to mention, it comes with knives and a slot to store nuts. Ok, real talk — isn’t this floral gardening tool set the cutest thing you’ve ever seen? Whether mom is an advanced gardener or just sharpening her green thumb, it’s one of the best gardening tools you can snag for just $30. Sleek and petite on your wrist is the best-selling Fitbit Charge 5, a premium, GPS-backed device that helps monitor your heart rate, calories burned and other health numbers for you to meet all your workout goals. Aside from a blood pressure monitor, it’s one of our most practical health gadgets to add to your cart. There’s nothing like fresh basil and herbs hitting your dish (or, perhaps your Always Pan). With the Click and Grow Smart Garden 3, you can have fresh greens without worrying about the weather outside. It’s easy to maintain and we wrote a full review on it. If there’s anything our readers love shopping for, it’s retinol. But, not just any retinol — the best creams and serums we rounded up. Across the skincare realm, Paula’s Choice is a clear-cut, top-tier option. Its 1% Retinol Treatment Cream is a lovely gift for mom who wants to craft a full-blown skincare routine. When in doubt, you can’t go wrong with UGG’s plush blanket. Not only is it one of our favorite throws, but we’ve gifted it so many times because it’s just as practical as it is beautiful. Switch things up this Mother’s Day with a lovely centerpiece the mom in your life can showcase atop her kitchen or dining room table. This five-rowed mason jars decor piece comes with pre-filled, artificial hydrangeas (a lovely faux plant) with a farmhouse touch Chip & Joanna would be proud of. If quality knives are on mom’s wishlist this year, Cuisinart has a fabulous 15-piece set (with a storage block) that’s so awesome, we want it ourselves. The creamy white look is too chic to pass up, with each knife (and pair of scissors!) coming with a sharp, effective edge. The best part? It’s currently $60 off! Lenox: a household name we love, especially for dinnerware sets. For $30, its French Perle Bouquet Vase is the move, giving us regal, “Bridgerton” energy we can’t help but tap into. Plus, it comes in a fluted vase for an even taller shape. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
