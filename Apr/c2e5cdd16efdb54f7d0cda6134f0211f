Paige VanZant certainly made a splash on Instagram over the weekend. The All Elite Wrestling star, 28, posted a trio of sexy snaps to her page, which featured her drenched in water outdoors while modeling a printed red bikini. “Cooling off this hot mess,” VanZant captioned one post with a nod to her exclusive content site, PaigeFanZant.com. In another shot, which she dubbed a “thirst trap,” the former UFC fighter is seen kneeling on the pavement while looking at the camera. VanZant has been living it up in Miami as of late, where she recently channeled her inner-Leonardo DiCaprio, a la “Titanic,” by posing near the bow of a boat. “They hate to see you happy……. So be happy,” she wrote alongside a scenic shot last week. VanZant recently opened up about her professional evolution in an interview with “The MMA Hour,” where she spoke about the early chapters of her career. “When I signed to the UFC, I was 19 years old. So I went from being a teenager to being a woman. And things change in your life. You mature, you grow up, you realize the things that set you apart. And I think, for me, too, it came to a point, I was trying to be on my best behavior for as long as possible,” VanZant said. “Before when I was in the UFC, I refused to get any tattoos. I wouldn’t do anything where I felt like I was gonna take myself away from getting endorsement deals, sponsorships. I wanted to make sure I was as accepted by every single venture… And it got to a point where I built my name up so much, now, I am who I am, and it’s not that I’m going to be another sponsored fighter or another person you endorse, I’m Paige VanZant, now I can do whatever the f—k I want, honestly… I get to just be myself.” VanZant joined Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship in 2020 and signed with AEW in March. She has been married to fellow fighter Austin Vanderford since 2018.
