A 2-year-old girl was shot dead by a Missouri cop during a tense hostage situation at a Kansas camping trailer, Kansas authorities revealed Monday. The tragedy unfolded on March 26 when Clesslynn Crawford and her mother were being held at gunpoint by her father, Eli Crawford, according to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Cops responded to the home in Cherokee County around 7:15 p.m. after a woman called 911 and requested help for a “domestic disturbance,” the KBI said. When officers arrived, Eli Crawford, 37, opened the door to his trailer before slamming it shut when he saw police, authorities said. The hostage situation escalated when Clesslynn reopened the door and the girl’s mother, Taylor Shutte, 27, bolted out of the trailer. Crawford gunned down the mother and fired off more than 90 rounds at four police officers, who didn’t return gunfire, officials said. Multiple agencies then flooded the scene, including the Joplin police SWAT team. The toddler was killed by a single shot fired into the trailer by a Joplin police officer, according to state officials. Crawford died of a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. “This is a horrific outcome to what had already started as a very tragic incident,” Joplin Police Chief Sloan Rowland said in the statement, according to the Joplin Globe. “Our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved and the surrounding community. We ask that you pray for the victims and everyone involved.” No law enforcement personnel were injured. “The investigation is ongoing,” the KBI said in a news release. “We ask the public for patience as KBI agents finish their work. The incident is being thoroughly and independently investigated. Once it concludes, the findings will be presented to the Cherokee County Attorney to determine if criminal charges will be filed.”
