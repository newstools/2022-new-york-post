Scottie Scheffler celebrated his first-ever Masters win on Sunday with wife Meredith Scudder by his side. The 25-year-old golfer clinched the title of 2022 Masters champion at Augusta National over the weekend after shooting 1-under for a 71 in Sunday’s final round, finishing at 10-under for the tournament. Scudder, who has been married to Scheffler since 2020, embraced her husband on the course following the win, with the couple sharing a kiss. Leading up to the opening round of this year’s Masters, Scudder joined Scheffler for the annual Par 3 contest on Wednesday, when the loved ones of golfers act as their caddies. “First timers at the Par 3 & it definitely lived up to the hype. Mere is still working on cleaning the grooves…,” Scheffler quipped on Instagram. Scudder sported caddie attire for the outing as Scheffler wrapped an arm around his favorite fan. Earlier this year, Scudder made separate appearances on the course, celebrating Scheffler’s win at the WM Phoenix Open in February, as well as last month’s Arnold Palmer Invitational and the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play, respectively. Scheffler is currently ranked the world’s top golfer and, as of Sunday, now has four PGA Tour victories to his name. The Masters victory was his first major championship.
