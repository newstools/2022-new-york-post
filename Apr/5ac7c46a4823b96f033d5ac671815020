It’s all coming back to her now. Céline Dion is making her rom-com debut in “It’s All Coming Back to Me,” which is set to hit theaters Feb. 10, 2023 — and comes with a bonus new track from the legendary diva. The movie features Dion’s music, and she’ll be starring as herself, though it’s not a biopic about the iconic 54-year-old French Canadian songstress. Filming on “It’s All Coming Back to Me,” a remake of the 2016 German film “SMS für Dich,” or “Text for You,” wrapped early last year. It stars Priyanka Chopra, 39, whose bereaved character develops a habit of sending romantic texts to her late fiancé’s former cellphone as a way to cope with his loss. The number turns out to be reassigned to another man, played by Sam Heughan (“Outlander”), 41, who is grappling with his own loss. The two heartbroken characters meet and develop a connection. Dion, as herself, serves as a mentor figure who inspires Chopra’s and Heughan’s characters to fall in love. The Sony-distributed flick is named after the Jim Steinman ballad “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,” which was famously covered by Dion for her 1996 breakout album “Falling Into You.” Heughan told Variety that the best-selling Canadian and French-language artist of all time has also recorded a new song for the movie. Meanwhile, the French Canadian film “Aline,” a fictionalization of Dion’s life, is currently showing in select US cinemas, with her name being changed to Aline Dieu. Dion announced last year that an “official” documentary is also on the way. Citing health concerns, the singer recently canceled several North American dates of her “Courage” world tour, which began just before the pandemic in 2020. Her schedule picks up again in May with a string of European dates.
