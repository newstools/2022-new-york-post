Timothy Klein, one of New York’s Bravest, paid the ultimate price for living a life of service, dying in a Brooklyn blaze Sunday. He was 31. Eight others were injured as flames swept through the second floor of 10826 Avenue N in Canarsie, sending firefighters leaping from windows as the building caved in. Klein, a six-year FDNY veteran, reportedly got separated from fellow Bravest and didn’t get out in time. The blaze was “the scariest thing I’ve ever seen,” said local Clara McKenley. “Everybody was running back inside their houses to get away from it.” Yet Klein and his comrades did their duty and ran into it. He grew up in Breezy Point dreaming of following his dad and uncles into the department, a firefighter cousin told The Post, and got his wish with assignment to Ladder Co. 170, where he earned nicknames like “the Golden Child.” He’s survived by his father Patrick, mother Diane and three sisters. In the eulogy for fellow firefighter Steven Pollard, killed responding to a car crash in 2019, Timothy Klein himself noted: He “died not thinking of himself but trying to help others. We lost a true hero . . . You will never be forgotten.” Amen, again. May he rest in peace.
