A 15-year-old student has been stabbed to death in a “random” attack by a male intruder at a high school in California, police said. Alicia Reynaga was stabbed multiple times by the trespasser, who was identified as Anthony Gray, after he entered Stagg High School in Stockton shortly after 11 a.m. Monday, news station KCRA reported. She was brought to a local hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries, police said. Campus security detained Gray and the school was placed on lockdown, KCRA reported. “Stagg High School is currently under lockdown for the safety of all staff and students,” Stockton Unified School District tweeted. “A trespasser approached the campus and stabbed a student.” Gray drove to the school and went through a campus gate, police said. The assailant carried out the attack before security could stop him, Stockton Unified School District Superintendent John Ramirez Jr. said. Police said the stabbing appeared to be a “random act.” Authorities have recovered a weapon from the scene and the investigation is ongoing to “try to determine why this student was targeted.” Police said Monday they arrested Gray on suspicion of murder and booked him into San Joaquin County Jail. School officials said the district “definitely will be re-evaluating” campus security. “We began to work with local law enforcement immediately and they’ve taken over the investigation,” the superintendent said.
