As part of The Post’s 2022 NFL Draft preview, we examine what the Jets might do at each position. Today: Wide receivers Next up: Tight ends. It feels like a certainty the Jets will draft a wide receiver early unless Joe Douglas can swing a trade before the draft arrives. Douglas took a big swing at Tyreek Hill last month but did not connect, and now Hill is with the Dolphins. But Douglas showed how much the Jets want to get a weapon for Zach Wilson just by being in the conversation for Hill. He also explored other options on the trade block such as Amari Cooper and D.K. Metcalf. The Jets could use one of their two first-round picks on a receiver. USC’s Drake London and Ohio State’s Garrett Wilson are considered to be the top receivers by most draftniks. It definitely feels like the Jets could draft one of them at No. 10, and maybe even with the No. 4 overall pick. The Jets have not drafted a wide receiver in the first round since Santana Moss in 2001. A wild card in the first round is Alabama star Jameson Williams, who would have been the No. 1 receiver in this class if he had not torn the ACL in his left knee in the national championship game. Now, the question is how patient will a team be that drafts Williams. Can it wait for him to be ready to play at midseason and maybe not have an impact until Year 2? The Jets don’t feel like a team that can wait on their first-round picks to make an impact, so Williams feels unlikely for them, but it is going to be an interesting decision for Douglas.
