Do we have the scoop on the best and more viral sales from Our Place? Always. Now through May 8, Our Place will be holding their biggest sale of the season, offering sizzling good deals on the Always Pan, Perfect Pot, a bundle with both and more. To set the table for spring, we suggest shopping right now, as the viral cookware is known to sell out in seconds, especially in trendy colors like the pink Spice shade and the new neon green Acid. Getting into the delicious details, the first item on sale is the viral and coveted Always Pan. We’ve been obsessed since we reviewed it ourselves, and now the pan will be marked down to $115 from the original price of $145. Use that savings to invest in the counterpart to the pan, the Perfect Pot. The larger non-stick, non-toxic kitchen must-have comes in the same aesthetically-pleasing shades as the pan, now $125 instead of $165. If you must have both (which you probably do) you can bundle your savings and grab the Home Cook Duo, now marked down to $225 from $250, saving you a pretty penny on both the Always Pan and the Perfect Pot. Last, but never least at Our Place, finish stocking your cabinets and planning the perfect dinner party with new dinnerware and other accessories, now 20% off while supplies last. This includes plates, bowls, knife sets, cutting boards and more, all of which is made to last in true Our Place sustainable fashion. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
