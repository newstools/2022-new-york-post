A Virginia daycare owner has been charged after three toddlers ate THC-laced goldfish, authorities said Friday. The 1-year-olds, who are not related, were taken to a hospital in Stafford last month after their parents noticed the kids had “glassy, bloodshot eyes,” the Stafford County Sheriff’s Office said. The children were also displaying lethargic and uncoordinated behavior. Hospital staff ran tests and confirmed each child had been exposed to THC — the psychoactive substance found in cannabis that produces the high sensation. Investigators linked the three children to the licensed home daycare provider run by 60-year-old Rebecca Swanner. During a search of the daycare, detectives collected goldfish crackers found scattered around the children’s high chairs. Lab tests subsequently confirmed traces of THC in the crackers. Swanner voluntarily surrendered her daycare license after Child Protective Services became involved in the case. She turned herself in on Thursday and has been charged with three counts of cruelty and injury to children, the sheriff’s office said. Swanner was released on a $2,000 unsecured bond.
