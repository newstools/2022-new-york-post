She never skips leg day. A Brazilian bodybuilder claims her gym-honed legs are standing in the way of her sex life, scaring off men who have skinnier stems. Anne Lima, 34, says her “tree trunk” gams measure just over 2 feet in circumference and are often on the receiving end of backhanded compliments and cruel jokes. “The size of my legs have already made some men fail to get an erection in the bedroom,” the beauty bluntly told Jam Press on Thursday. “They are very surprised because most of the time my legs are bigger than theirs,” she candidly continued, claiming men have compared her legs to those of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. “It affects me a lot because [men] are embarrassed and they think I’m weird next to them,” she added. Lima says she has been working on her fit physique for more than 13 years, building up her muscular legs with a series of strenuous strength exercises. But the fitness queen — who is representing Rio de Janeiro in this year’s Miss Bumbum competition — says her stems have also been the subject of amusement outside of the bedroom. “I don’t really care for the comments,” she said. “I get it all the time. I get it at the gym and even get stopped on the street. Once a stranger asked to rub my legs. It was pretty weird.” “It makes me feel bad because changing my body was an act of love for myself,” the beauty further declared. Despite her sex life suffering, Lima says she is proud of her “big, strong” stems and has no plans to tone down her gym routine. “My legs are really natural. I’ve never had any kind of procedure,” she enthused. “You can see the muscle cut. There is nothing that imitates muscle.” The Brazilian beauty added that self-love is far more powerful than any kind of validation from a man: “When I look in the mirror, I see a big and strong tree.”
