A crash that involved two Army helicopters and killed a soldier in Georgia last week was “not an accident” and officials are probing whether it was done intentionally, a report said on Tuesday. Capt. James Bellew, 26, was on MedEvac duty when two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters were involved in a crash at an airfield on Fort Stewart around 2 a.m. Wednesday. Bellew was found dead at the site of the crash. A source told the Army Times a criminal investigation was underway. Officials haven’t released details of what they referred to only as an “incident,” but apparently only Bellew was involved. “The initial indication is that all other crewmembers were asleep at the time of the incident,” said Lt. Col. Lindsey Elder of the 3rd Infantry Division. ‘”t this point, we cannot address the manner of the damage to the two aircrafts, timeline of events, or the response from the tower and emergency services, as those details are still considered part of the active investigation.” The US Army Criminal Investigation Division had launched an investigation as per policy with a non-combat death of a soldier, the Savannah Morning News reported. The newspaper identified Bellew as a native of Charlottesville, Virginia and a “decorated officer” who began his career in 2017.
