Kendrick Lamar is back. The 34-year-old rapper is finally dropping a new album — titled “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” — after five years. The Compton, California, native tweeted a link to his Oklama website, where he revealed his new record’s title and release date. The new album will be out on May 13. He announced the news on his Instagram with a heartfelt note that said “appreciate your patience.” Back in August 2021, Lamar first poked fun at his new record on his website, which, at the time, he called “final TDE album.” “May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my life’s calling,” he scribbled on the site. “There’s beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.” He then signed his memo, “Oklama.” The “To Pimp a Butterfly” rapper last released a full album in 2017 with his tracklist entitled “Damn.” Fans went absolutely crazy on social media, showing off their excitement for Lamar’s next project. “NO F –  -KING WAY NO F –  -KING WAY THIS IS NOT REAL,” one exclaimed. “I JUST FELL TO MY FEET IN WALMART OMGG,” another joked. Someone else added, “Finally The best to ever do it!” “ITS HAPPENING,” one said. “Its Kendrick SZN baby!”
