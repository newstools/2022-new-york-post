NFL star Jerry Tillery, a defensive end for the LA Chargers, was recently spotted house hunting in the city. One spot he toured was a $4.76 million penthouse with a rooftop terrace at 145 Central Park North in Harlem. The four-bedroom, three-bath home is 1,757 square feet — and features Central Park views. Design details include white oak floors, floor-to-ceiling windows with white oak frames, motorized shades and a fireplace. There’s an open living room/dining room with Central Park views and a chef’s kitchen. The main bedroom also boasts park views and an ensuite bathroom while another bedroom has access to a balcony. The outdoor roof terrace comes with a hot tub and an outdoor kitchen. Crypto entrepreneur Lane Rettig and his wife Lily also own in the building, as Gimme previously reported. Building amenities include a children’s playroom, gym, residents’ lounge and a common rooftop deck. The building was developed by GRID Group with sales led by Ryan Serhant and Jennifer Alese of Serhant, and Mike Fabbri and Ashley Brooke of Nestseekers International.
