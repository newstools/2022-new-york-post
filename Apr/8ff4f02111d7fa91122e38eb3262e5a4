Slain Queens mom Orsolya Gaal appeared to have tipped off investigators to her accused killer – by posting a note on her refrigerator that read “GET A NEW HANDYMAN” before she was brutally stabbed to death, law enforcement sources said. The handwritten memo was found by detectives last weekend at Gaal’s Forest Hills home, early on in their investigation into the shocking slaying of Gaal, whose body was discovered Saturday morning stuffed inside a hockey bag that was found outside of Forest Park, sources said. The note, first reported by The Daily Beast, was an apparent reference to David Bonola, 44 — Gaal’s family’s heating and air conditioning repairman who was arrested Thursday and charged with her murder. Bonola allegedly confessed to cops – then gave a second one on video for prosecutors, police sources told The Post Thursday. The accused killer told cops he had an on-and-off again affair with the married mother of two and said they’d gotten back together earlier this month before splitting up again. Early Saturday morning, Bonola allegedly showed up to Gaal’s home to talk about their relationship — but when the chat turned sour, he flew into a rage and allegedly stabbed her nearly 60 times with a kitchen knife, cops said. Bonola faces charges of murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal tampering.
