“Survivor” contestant Ralph Kiser suffered a fatal heart attack Wednesday morning, according to The Sun. He was 56 years old. Kiser, a Virginia farmer, appeared on Season 22 of “Survivor: Redemption Island” in 2011. He was a member of the Zapatera tribe and finished eighth in the reality competition. “The Survivor family extends our deepest condolences to the family of Ralph Kiser,” host Jeff Probst said through the show’s Twitter account. “His huge smile, his positive attitude and of course his infectious rooster crow made him one of the most likable to ever play Survivor.” Kiser longed to join the “Survivor” cast. The Virginia native routinely applied to compete on the show in hopes to become “a hometown hero for the folks back home,” according to his contestant profile. Kiser, who described himself as “determined, strong-willed, and stubborn,” became a fan favorite for “Survivor” viewers. “I’m a likable person if you get to know me, Kiser said during an introductory interview in 2011. “I’ll make you laugh your a— off.” Following his “dream” stint on “Survivor,” Kiser remained in Virginia where he owned and operated the Clinch Mountain Small Animal Auction.
