TikTok star, Hectic Nick, says the creepy smiley face image below can be used to play a trick on your mind if you dare to follow his instructions. Challenging viewers he said: “Focus your eyes on the red dot for about 15 seconds. “After that, look at a blank wall and start blinking. You’ll see something pretty amazing.” Viewers in the comments reacted in the comments as they were left terrified by the results. One said: “I’m home alone and scared right now” as a second added, “nearly gave me a heart attack.” A third added: “That is so scary.” Some even went further and revealed what images they saw on the blank wall after focusing on the creepy image. “I saw a puppet,” one freaked as another claimed they saw a joker’s mask. A third added: “When I stopped blinking, it stayed on the wall for a sec. I swear, a full five seconds.” The Sun previously shared a collection of terrifying optical illusions where not everything is as it seems.
