The NYPD has collared the suspected shooter behind Monday’s killing of a 61-year-old Bronx woman — who was fatally struck by a bullet earlier this week after getting caught in the crossfire of a gambling dispute, police officials said. Donald Johnson, a 20-year-old alleged Bloods gang member, was arrested Friday morning on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges, along with his brother, 33-year-old Rakell Hampton, Chief of Detectives James Essig said.

Hampton was with Johnson and one other unknown man when they started arguing with vendors in the area, Essig said The alleged gang member fired off five shots at one of the vendors from his 9mm handgun that he pulled from his backpack, police said.
