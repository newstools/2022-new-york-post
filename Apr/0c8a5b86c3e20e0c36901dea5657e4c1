A newlywed Virginia couple was found shot dead in their apartment earlier this week — and cops are searching for the groom’s missing brother, authorities said. The bodies of Talon Rodgers and his wife, Alisa Wash, both 23, were discovered with gunshot wounds inside their Virginia Beach apartment on Monday night. Cops described the case as a double homicide and indicated that neither Rodgers nor Wash appeared to be responsible for the shooting. On Wednesday, police revealed they were looking for Rodgers’ 20-year-old brother, Collin Rodgers, after his family reported him missing amid the homicide probe. Police said they are treating Collin as an “endangered adult” due to the unknown circumstances surrounding his disappearance. Collin was last seen by his parents on March 27 — a week before the bodies of his brother and sister-in-law were discovered, cops said. It wasn’t immediately clear when the couple died, but a neighbor told 13News Now that she recalled hearing loud sounds on March 30. Investigators believe Collin may have been temporarily living with the newlywed couple in their apartment before the shooting, the outlet reported. Rodgers and Wash had only been married a month, according to social media and neighbors. Wash had uploaded a Facebook photo on March 11 of the couple posing on their wedding day. She changed her relationship status to married that same day. “They were such good people,” a neighbor told the Virginian-Pilot. “They were always together.” Police have not named any suspects in the couple’s death.
