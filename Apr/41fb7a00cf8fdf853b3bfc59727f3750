A man was stabbed multiple times in Brooklyn, police said. The victim was found on his couch in his apartment at 557 East 21st St., after someone called cops for help late Friday. The unidentified victim was taken to Kings County Hospital. His condition is unknown, the NYPD said. No one was arrested but an eyewitness told The Post a bloodied woman was seen giving cops directions to the apartment where the stabbing victim was found. “A man was dragged out of that apartment and put into a squad car,” the witness said. “They both seemed as if they were under the influence of probably drugs — looked spaced out.” Another stabbing occurred around 3:15 a.m. Saturday near a hot dog stand in Times Square, police said. Two men were arguing when one of them stabbed the other. The unidentified victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital. His condition is unknown, police said.
