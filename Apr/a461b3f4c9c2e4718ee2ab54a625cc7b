Tony Shalhoub, who stars as Maisel’s father on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” is on the move. The actor is selling his 12th-floor co-op at 15 West 81st St. on the Upper West Side for $4.5 million. Shalhoub bought the apartment in 2016 for just under $4 million, according to the listing broker James Foreman of Brown Harris Stevens, and lives there with his wife Brooke Adams, who is an actress and painter. The property is in a building from 1930 and was designed by the renowned architect Emery Roth, behind high-profile projects such as the San Remo, one of the city’s ritziest co-ops, and The First Hungarian Reformed Church on East 69th Street. Spanning around 1.850 square feet, Shalhoub’s apartment is a classic five and has two bedrooms, two full bathrooms and a half bath. Foreman says that it sees an abundance of light throughout the day. Many of the original architectural details are still intact throughout the home, but they’ve all been resorted. They include stainless steel and glass kitchen cabinets, moldings, doorknobs, herringbone patterned oak floors and the basket-weave mosaic floors in the bathrooms. “The beautiful architecture that’s been carefully updated is what makes the apartment so special,” said Foreman. Other features include a semi-private elevator landing, spacious bedrooms with large closets, a sprawling living room with French doors and a pantry with a washer and dryer. And then there’s the showpiece of a 60-foot-long terrace with original ironwork railings and open views of the city; the terrace’s side views of Central Park are also an attraction. Amenities in the co-op itself include a gym, bike room and children’s playroom Foreman cannot disclose why Shalboub and Adams are selling the property.
