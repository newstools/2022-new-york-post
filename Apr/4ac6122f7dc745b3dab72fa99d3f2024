The latest big-screen creation of DreamWorks Animation topped opening night totals for new flicks from star actors Alexander Skarsgard and Nicolas Cage. “The Bad Guys” — an animated romp about five over-the-hill anthropomorphic criminals — raked in $8 million in ticket sales on April 22, its first day in theaters. Skarsgard’s Viking revenge tale “The Northman,” meanwhile, came in at number two at the box office, earning $5 million. Last week’s box office winner — “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” — dropped to number three. The latest Harry Potter flick earned $4.1 million — down from over 20 million ticket sales on April 15. “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” earned $4 million on Friday, while Cage’s “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” — in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself — rounded out the top five box office performers at $2.9 million.
