There’s more light in this loft than on some city streets. An expansive Manhattan penthouse that counts the “Requiem For a Dream” actress Jennifer Connelly among its former residents has been listed for $12 million. Maintenance fees at the co-op building run $7,180 a month. “There’s something incredibly serene about the space,” listing agent Debbie Korb of Sotheby’s International Realty – Downtown Manhattan Brokerage told The Post. “Sunlight glittering off the river, large expanses of wide-open spaces, and an enchanting rooftop terrace.” The full-floor, four-bathroom, two-and-a-half bathroom Tribeca loft features full walls of windows, multiple skylights and sweeping views of the Hudson River. Inside the 4,000-square-foot space, there’s a library with a wood-burning stove, a 45-foot-wide living room, arched factory windows, built-in shelving galore and a double-height kitchen, 6sqft previously reported. The primary suite offers both a dressing room and ensuite bath complete with a travertine-clad stand-alone tub. Up a set of minimalist stairs, a sunroom overlooks the city and leads out to the 1,280-square-foot outdoor area. “While it is quintessential Tribeca, it also evokes the California coast. There is even a sauna on the roof,” said Korb. “It’s at once dramatic and calming.” Connelly, 51, and her actor husband Paul Bettany, 50, bought the 288 West St. unit for a little less than $7 million in 2008, according to 6sqft. In 2012, they reportedly got $8.495 million for the space in an off-market sale, according to 6sqft. The Tribeca unit is not the only former home of Connelly’s to recently hit the market: Last month, the Oscar winner’s former 6,500-square-foot limestone at 17 Prospect Park West listed for $12.2 million. The seven-bedroom, three-bathroom offers such details as stained glass windows, herringbone floors and coffered ceilings, The Post previously reported. It was built in 1899 and has been home to numerous big names since Connelly’s time there.
