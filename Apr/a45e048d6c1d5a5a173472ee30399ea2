Opening Day week is upon us, ending with Yankees-Red Sox on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball,” which will have a complete broadcasting overhaul. In the main weekly booth, it will be Karl Ravech, Eduardo Perez and David Cone. There was some question about whether dugout reporter Buster Olney would be part of the broadcast. He will be at each game every week, but the plan is to de-emphasize his in-game contributions. This brings us to our in-depth opening topic: Alex Rodriguez’s Manningcast-like alternative broadcast, which has been officially titled, “Kay-Rod.” It will feature YES play-by-player and ESPN New York talk show host Michael Kay teaming with Rodriguez for eight Sunday night broadcasts on ESPN2.
