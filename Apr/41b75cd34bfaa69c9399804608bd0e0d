Just after the Carolina Hurricanes clinched the NHL’s Metropolitan division, the team announced that broadcaster Tripp Tracy will be stepping away from his duties to “address a personal matter.” The former NHL player was not in the broadcast booth for the Canes’ division-clinching win over the Rangers on Tuesday, and before the game, he sent a pair of troubling tweets that referenced a “drinking problem.” The tweets have since been deleted, but according to WRAL, one of them said: “For those who struggle with drinking, trust me I have tied [sic] harder than anything else I’ve done in my whole life … but on this one I finally surrender.” The next morning, another tweet was sent from his account, which still remains on his page: “i am disgusted with myself that on the night @canes win the Metro Division that I was an extremely unimpressive distraction. I accept and know the steps I need to take to deal with this problem. Thank you to all Huge Caniacs for being so incredibly supportive,” the tweet read. Don Waddell, the Hurricanes’ GM and team president, released a statement on Wednesday about the longtime broadcaster. “Tripp is going to take some time away from the team and the broadcast to address a personal matter,” the statement read. “We are in full support of his efforts to get healthy and ask that everyone please respect his privacy in this matter.” Tracy is a beloved figure among Hurricanes fans, having spent more than 20 years as the team’s voice on Fox Sports and Bally Sports. He is known for his catchphrases, calling fans “Huge Caniacs” and often using the phrase “dig in” on broadcasts. “No matter what is or isn’t happening, just wanted to say Tripp Tracy is one of the best people I’ve met in my life — not just in hockey,” Hurricanes reporter Sara Civian of The Athletic wrote on Twitter. “A truly special person that has helped me with so much and has made me feel heard and respected. Let’s have some respect and appreciation.”
