We are head first into spring, and that means it’s time for all sorts of spring cleaning. Maybe you’ve finally decided to go through your mess of a closet, or perhaps you’ve taken on the feat of sorting your beauty products into makeup organizers. But we have another spring cleaning option for you. Right now, you can head over to Dyson and score the coveted Dyson V8 Absolute for $50 off to kickstart your home cleaning game. This discount rings the Dyson V8 Absolute in at $450, which compares to the original price of $500. That means, you can enjoy a lightweight and versatile vacuum with up to 40 minutes of run time and two power modes at a discounted price. Not only that, but the vacuum comes with a soft roller cleaner head, crevice tool, mini motorized tool, docking station and charger. You can also look forward to a mini soft dusting pan, direct drive cleaner head and combination tool. With the above tools, you’ll seamlessly clean carpets, gently clean hard floors and transform your vacuum into a handheld. But we get it — $450 can still be a bit steep for a vacuum. Though, it’s totally worth it. With over 3,250 4.6/5 star reviews, and 91% of those reviewers saying they would recommend the product to a friend, it’s undoubtably a stellar product. “Friends have recommended that I get this vacuum for months,” said one reviewer. “I procrastinated a lot before my purchase — what was I thinking! I never should have waited on this vacuum — it’s the best ever.” Another said, “How I ever lived without this vacuum is beyond me. I love the ease in which I can clean everything. Yes it’s pricey but it’s worth every penny. Do yourself a favor get a Dyson vacuum.” Interested in more Dyson news and shopping?
