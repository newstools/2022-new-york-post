Having a smart home is a dream. Just imagine being able to ask a vacuum to clean your room, enjoying automatic adjustment of your thermostat, or asking your virtual assistant to complete arduous tasks on your behalf. At this point, it’s likely that you already have some smart devices in your home, perhaps a smart TV that streams your favorite shows via voice commands or a smart doorbell that notifies you when your Amazon delivery has finally arrived. If you want to enjoy true automation and control, though, you can begin with controlling your lights. After all, walking to the switch to turn it on and off can sometimes be a chore, so you may want to make light control a little less tedious. The Smart Dimmer Plug with Remote Control can help you on that front.  While traditional dimmers exist, this plug offers extra convenience by giving you complete control over your lamp and other lighting pieces. Compatible with most lighting systems, it allows you to control the ambiance of any room in your home through a remote control, app, or even just your voice. The accompanying app enables you to schedule your lights, set special scenes, dim them down to 1%, or however you want your lights to be set. You also have the option to use the included remote control or connect it to Alexa or Google Assistant for voice control. This dimmer plug works with string lights, floor lamps, table lamps, and basically any bulb that’s dimmable. You can even control them all in just a single click, thanks to the group control feature. With the IP44 waterproof rating, you can use it both outdoors and indoors without worrying about running into electrical trouble. According to a satisfied Amazon user, this device is a “sturdy well built plug, my electrician husband approves and says it should stand the test of time and even weather.” The Smart Dimmer Plug with Remote Control normally goes for $32, but you can get it on sale for only $26.99 for a limited time.
