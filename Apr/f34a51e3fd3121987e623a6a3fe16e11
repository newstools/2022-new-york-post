A man was stabbed with a box cutter during a squabble inside a Lower Manhattan subway station early Tuesday, cops and police sources said. The victim, said to be in his 40s, was arguing with another man on a northbound 4 train, cops said. When both men got off the train at Wall Street around 6:10 a.m., the assailant attacked his fellow straphanger with a box cutter on the staircase, according to cops and the sources. The victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Police were still looking for the attacker later in the morning. The nature of the dispute was unclear. The incident comes about a week after an ex-cop was slashed by an attacker who first spat at him and his wife at the same station, according to police.
