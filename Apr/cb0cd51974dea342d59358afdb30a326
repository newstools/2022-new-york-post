An antisemitic New Jersey man went on a shocking hours-long crime spree targeting Hasidic Jews — having warned his family to expect “a blood bath,” according to police documents. Dion Marsh, 27, was charged with three counts of attempted murder as well as bias intimidation for allegedly running down two men and stabbing another in the chest on Saturday, Ocean County prosecutors said. The spree started with a violent carjacking in Lakewood Township just after 1 p.m. — and only ended nearly 10 hours later when he was arrested at home in Manchester, prosecutors said. Two of his victims — including an Orthodox Jew who was stabbed — were listed in critical but stable condition, police said. Marsh was identified after an anonymous citizen tipped off cops after recognizing him in security video of the carjacking, according to court documents obtained by NJ.com. A family member then told cops that Marsh recently split from a girlfriend and warned them that “it’s going to be a blood bath,” the docs said. Marsh was busted after being found on his bed holding “what appeared to be a machete on his chest,” the docs said, according to NJ.com. He then confessed to detectives, telling them “it had to be done” because Hasidic Jews “are the real devils,” the report said. The FBI’s Newark office tweeted that it was “aware” of the violence, and was “prepared to investigate” if “information comes to light of a potential federal violation.” The Anti-Defamation League’s local director, Scott Richman, said that he was “personally horrified at the cruelty” of the allegations. “More needs to be done proactively to prevent violence against the Jewish community, and in particular visibly identifiable Jews in Ocean County and across our region,” Richman said.
