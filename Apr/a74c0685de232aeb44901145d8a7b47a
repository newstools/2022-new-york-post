Mayor Eric Adams has caved to the COVID alarmists by reversing himself on his previous decision to unmask under-5 kids in schools starting Monday. This is cruel and anti-science — and to try to blame a minor uptick in case levels in NYC public schools, as Adams does, is the height of absurdity. Kids under 5 are, quite literally, the lowest-risk group for COVID on the planet. Around 120 of them have died in total from COVID since March 2020, out of close to 1 million US deaths overall. Many of the younger kids who did die had pre-existing comorbidities. And, as the mayor himself has said in saner moments, schools are among the safest places to be in terms of transmission. Worse, masks have messed up younger kids, big-time. New reporting from The Post reveals early-education teachers around the city describing severe emotional, academic and speech-acquisition issues with preschoolers. Developments like that can have long-lasting consequences. Masks are no longer mandatory for older kids in schools. They are not mandatory at workplaces, bars, restaurants or gyms for adults — even people over 65, who represent by far the most vulnerable group for COVID deaths. The judge who on Friday struck down the under-5 mandate (Adams is appealing) has it right: It is “arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.” There’s just no justification for this madness. None. It’s pure, cowardly politics. Shame on you, Mr. Mayor.
