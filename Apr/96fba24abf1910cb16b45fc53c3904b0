A 4-year-old boy with autism was found dead in a pond after wandering away from a Georgia apartment building, police said Tuesday. Kyuss Williams, who vanished on Monday while visiting relatives, walked away from an apartment complex in Stone Mountain at about 6:20 p.m. and was reported missing just minutes later, DeKalb County police told The Post. “Kyuss was recovered around 2:30 a.m. this morning in a nearby pond,” police said in a statement. “We extend our condolences to the Kyuss family during this time and we thank everyone who worked to find him.” Foul play is not suspected and no charges had been filed as of Tuesday afternoon in an ongoing investigation, police said. Kyuss, who had autism, was visiting relatives at East Ponce Village Apartments when he walked away, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. “The family was in the residence when they realized the child had left the residence,” DeKalb County Police Chief Mirtha Ramos told reporters at the scene. “They didn’t know where the child was.” Cops shut down the area for several hours after Kyuss vanished, a resident at the complex told the newspaper. “Fire department, helicopter, you name it — they had it out here,” William Brown said. “They had the dogs, and I think that’s how they knew the baby was in the water.” Rescuers searched a retention pond and found Kyuss’ body. Surveillance video from across the street captured him headed in that direction, WAGA reported. One neighbor told the station she thinks the pond should be fenced off to prevent further tragedies. “They’ve been looking for this baby since earlier yesterday, and for them to just find this baby at like 2:30 in the morning, it’s downright wrong,” resident Delores Watson said. “I can just pray for the parents.” The relative whom Kyuss was visiting along with his family had just moved into the area, WSB-TV reported.
