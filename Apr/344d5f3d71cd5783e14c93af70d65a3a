Buck Showalter was never going to be the same leader in 2022 as he was in 1992 – when he rode Melido Perez for 10 complete games – but certainly some older-school tendencies would arise. A dozen games is too soon to evaluate a season or a skipper, as exciting as this 9-3 opening has been. We have a snapshot, nothing more, and the next 150 games (and beyond, the Mets hope) will reveal much more about Showalter than we know right now. But through 12 games, what have we gleaned about the Mets manager? Glad you asked!
