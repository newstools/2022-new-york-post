Two passionate fan bases might truly be hoping for losses at this point, which makes the NHL showdown Thursday between the Philadelphia Flyers and Montreal Canadiens a contest only a bettor could love. Each franchise is in the midst of a six-game losing streak, but I feel we have some clear value on one side. The Canadiens suffered a tough-luck loss Friday to the New York Islanders in Carey Price’s first game back in goal since last July. On Monday, they hung around with a legitimate contender, the Minnesota Wild, who are desperate to stay alive in the race for second in the Central Division.  The 3-2 defeat in Toronto that started this whole slump featured another reasonable effort. My expectation is Montreal will get its play back on track, and I still believe this group is excited to play as it skates out a lost season. Price will likely get the start, which is another reason we can see the Canadiens putting together a highly motivated effort. Montreal’s overall play has looked respectable over the last three contests and I think they will finally pay it off with a positive result. Philadelphia’s back end is in a complete shambles, so I think this is a great spot for us to see Montreal find some of the offense it has been due in the losses. I see this as a pure buy-low spot for the Canadiens against an opponent whose roster is even more thin, and will be happy to back the hosts at -135 regardless if Price starts. Should Price get the nod, however, I really like this play at -135, as he has looked sharp, and think Montreal would love to get its guy the big win. The play: Canadiens, -135.
