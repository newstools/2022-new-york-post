The Biden White House is obsessed with putting a new Iran deal in place, no matter how often reality flies in the president’s face. The latest warning: A group of 18 House Democrats took their case against the deal — in its specifics and in general — to the press Wednesday. “We feel that we can’t stay quiet,” said Rep. Elaine Luria (Va.). Absolutely: The developing deal would be an even bigger disaster than the 2015 Obama accord that President Donald Trump rightly withdrew from. That entente emboldened Iran, upped the global legitimacy of its theocratic terror regime and put the Islamic Republic on a glidepath to “legally” building nukes. This one would likely do the same. Israeli experts put the time to nuclear breakout under such a deal at four to six months. Plus, it requires massive buy-in from Vladimir Putin, the guy President Joe Biden has rightly called a “war criminal” who “cannot remain in power.” So the deal includes sanctions waivers for Russia’s energy projects in Iran. Appeasing a butcher to cut a deal with another gang of butchers: Does it get more insane? Well, maybe: Biden’s held off on key aid to Ukraine (like letting Poland give it MiG fighters) for fear of triggering a war with a nuclear power. And this deal (like the first one) won’t stop Tehran from going nuclear, but at best delay it slightly. And a non-nuclear Iran is already a plague on the region, sponsoring wars and terrorists (and plots to kill US officials); protected by a nuclear umbrella, it’ll only grow more aggressive. The administration has already made so many concessions that several of its top diplomats left the team months ago, including Richard Nephew, a key Obama negotiator. The Iranians believe they’re on the edge of victory. Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Sunday: “We are close to an agreement in the negotiations.” If so, the world’s about to get a lot more dangerous. Cross your fingers that those House Democrats can finally wake the White House up.
