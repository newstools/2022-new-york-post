The New York Times has tapped managing editor Joe Kahn as its new executive editor. The Grey Lady announced on Tuesday that Kahn, 57, whose reporting from China earned him the Pulitzer Prize, will replace Dean Baquet, who will step down from the post after eight years. Kahn, who helped lead the newspaper’s international coverage of Europe and Asia, officially takes the reins of the Times’ 1,700-person newsroom beginning in June, according to the paper. “For many people, especially those who have worked alongside Joe — a brilliant journalist and a brave and principled leader — this announcement will come as no surprise,” publisher A.G. Sulzberger wrote in a memo to Times staff. “Joe brings impeccable news judgment, a sophisticated understanding of the forces shaping the world and a long track record of helping journalists produce their most ambitious and courageous work.” Kahn, who will work to accelerate the publication’s emphasis on digital news, said his mandate will be to restore the public’s trust in the Times “in a time of polarization and partisanship.” “We don’t know where the political zeitgeist will move over time,” Kahn told the Times. “Rather than chase that, we want to commit and recommit to being independent.” Baquet led the Times newsroom during the tumultuous period marked by the presidency of Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic. The 65-year-old Baquet, under whose leadership the Times captured 18 Pulitzer Prizes, will remain at the newspaper to “lead an exciting new venture.” Earlier this year, the Times said it surpassed 10 million digital subscribers after it announced the acquisition of The Athletic, the sports news website, for $550 million. The Times said it is aiming to expand its reach to 15 million paid subscribers by 2027.
