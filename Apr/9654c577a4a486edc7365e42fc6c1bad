Lamar Jackson appeared to be blindsided by Baltimore’s trade of Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, but the wide receiver insists that was not the case. After news of the Brown trade broke, the Ravens’ quarterback tweeted a succinct message: “Wtf”. Brown spoke to SiriusXM’s “I am Athlete Tonight” about the deal, and revealed that he had been in communication with Jackson — and that he had requested the trade out of Baltimore. “It was just . . . my happiness,” Brown said, as described by ProFootballTalk. “I talked to Lamar about it after my second year. And then after my third year, leading up to the end of the season, you know, he wasn’t playing. I let him know again, like, ‘Yeah, bro, I can’t do it.’ You know, it’s not really on Lamar, like I love Lamar. It was just, you know, it’s just the system just wasn’t for me personally. You know, I love all my teammates. I love the guys. It was just something I had to think about for myself.” Brown, who is headed to the Cardinals to reunite with Kyler Murray, his teammate at Oklahoma, caught 91 balls for 1,008 yards and six touchdowns last season. He was the Ravens’ leading wideout; tight end Mark Andrews accumulated more receptions and yards. Meanwhile, Robert Griffin III, who played with the duo on the Ravens with the duo and is now an analyst for ESPN, explained why Jackson would have been beside himself. “Lamar Jackson and Marquise Brown weren’t just teammates. They were brothers,” Griffin tweeted. “True South Floridians though and through. Never seen a bond like they had on and off the field. I know that trade hurt in more ways than just football.” Ultimately, the Ravens received the 23rd overall pick from the Cardinals in exchange for Brown. They then moved back two spots in a swap with the Bills, and ultimately selected Iowa center Tyler Lindenbaum with the No. 25 pick.
