Country singer and North Carolina Tar Heels fan Eric Church is offering unhappy fans a rain check after canceling an upcoming Texas tour stop to attend the NCAA Tournament. Church announced Friday that he would be returning to the Lone Star State for a “one of a kind free show” in New Braunfels on Sept. 2. “Thank you San Antonio for letting me take my family to this game,” Church wrote on Twitter. “It took me a minute to figure out how and when I could properly express my thanks.” Church was scheduled to bring his “The Gather Again Tour” to the AT&T Center in San Antonio on April 2. Concertgoers didn’t have much of a say Wednesday when they found out the “Springsteen” singer would be ditching them through a Ticketmaster message. “As a lifelong Carolina basketball fan, I’ve watched Carolina and Duke battle over the years,” Church said. “But to have them matchup in the Final Four for the first time in the history of the NCAA Tournament is any sports enthusiast’s dream.” “This is also the most selfish thing I’ve ever asked the Choir [his fanbase] to do: to give up your Saturday night plans with us so that I can have this moment with my family and sports community,” he continued. The AT&T Center offered fans ticket refunds, but many complained about non-refundable travel expenses on Twitter. “Is Eric going to pay for their motel and food and travel? He ruined a weekend for a lot of people,” @Douglas89979785 wrote. “How is it free if they already paid for the tickets and now they have to travel to new braunfels lol,” one Twitter user asked. The No. 8 Tar Heels are set to face rival No. 2 Duke in the Final Four
