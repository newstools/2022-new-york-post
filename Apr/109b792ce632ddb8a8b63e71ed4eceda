A Republican state senator from Tennessee invoked Adolf Hitler in a twisted attempt to tell homeless people that they can still make something of themselves​ — although he admitted that in the Nazi dictator’s case, it resulted in an “unproductive life.” State Sen. Frank Niceley took to the floor of the Nashville chamber Wednesday to support a bill that aims to reduce homeless camps and told his fellow lawmakers that he was going to “give a little history on homelessness.” “In 1910, Hitler decided to live on the streets for a while,” Niceley said. “So for two years, Hitler lived on the streets and practiced his oratory and his body language and how to connect with the masses,” the lawmaker went on, “and then went on to lead a life that got him in the history books​. “So [for] a lot of these people, it​’​s not a dead end. They can come out of these homeless camps and have a productive life, or in Hitler’s case, a very unproductive life,” he added. Hitler did go through a bout of homelessness after moving out of a friend’s apartment in Vienna in 1908 and spent time sleeping on park benches and begging for money before moving into a homeless shelter for several years. He then went on to become fuhrer of the Third Reich, instigate World War II and preside over the murder of 6 million Jews. “I owe it to that period that I grew hard and am still capable of being hard,” Hitler wrote in his autobiographical work “Mein Kampf” about his early life of poverty. The homeless bill, which expands punishments for camping on state-owned land to all public ​properties, was passed 22-10 by the state Senate, according to News 9 ABC. It will now go to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. Niceley’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Post.
