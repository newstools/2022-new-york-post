Comedian Bill Burr did a guest spot in the NESN booth on Tuesday during the Red Sox’s game against the Blue Jays, so naturally, Derek Jeter became a target. The Massachusetts native broke out his impression of Jeter – saying it was the only one in his act – jack-knifing out of the way when he saw a fastball down the middle of the plate. “Like six times out of 10 he’d get a ball,” Burr said. “Granted, he was one of the greatest who ever did it.” Burr is a known Boston sports fan who became popular via his Monday Morning Podcast, along with standup specials. He currently has a deal with Netflix and is going on tour this year. Surprisingly, he did cut Jeter a bit of a break. “That guy he was incredible,” Burr said. “I don’t hate individuals. They’re great. I can’t work up that level of hate. … There’s a whole bunch of Yankees that I love. I just hate them. That’s just what you’re supposed to do.” The Hall of Fame shortstop batted .291 lifetime against the Red Sox and .266 at Fenway Park. He played more games at Fenway than any other road ballpark and more games against Boston than any other opposing team except the Orioles. He ended his career at Fenway in 2014 and got similar respect from the crowd, exiting to an ovation after a 20-year career.
