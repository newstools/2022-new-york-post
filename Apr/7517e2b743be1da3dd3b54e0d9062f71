Here’s what to expect from the Giants on Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) of the 2022 NFL Draft on Friday. It is no secret the Giants were interested in taking a cornerback in the first round and likely would have pounced on Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner at No. 5 if the Jets did not take him at No. 4. So, a cornerback is definitely in play at No. 36 overall, high in the second round. GM Joe Schoen said not getting a corner in the first round does not affect the status of James Bradberry, who continues to be shopped for needed salary cap relief.
