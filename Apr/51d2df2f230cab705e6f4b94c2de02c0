Eleven games fill out Monday’s MLB schedule and Mike Ianniello of The Action Network is here to give a trio of best bets (video above). The first contest interesting Ianniello is the New York Mets against the Philadelphia Phillies. But, rather than picking a side in that game, he’s looking to a player prop: Kyle Schwarber over 1.5 total bases (-130) on DraftKings. (Editor’s note: The line has moved from +120 as of Monday afternoon.) “[Schwarber] has been held hitless in his last two games, but now he gets to face one of his favorite pitchers: Taijuan Walker,” Ianniello explains. “In 10 at-bats against Walker, Schwarber is 5-of-10 with five home runs.” For Ianniello’s next play of the day, he’s looking to back the Toronto Blue Jays’ moneyline (+100) on BetMGM against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. “I think [Toronto] has the best offense in baseball,” Ianniello says. “Last year they finished first in weighted on-base average and second in weighted runs created.” Plus, Ianniello expects the Blue Jays’ ability to hit fastballs well with trouble Yankees starting pitcher Jameson Taillon, who used his fastball on 49.5 percent of all pitches last season. Ianniello’s final play comes in the Seattle Mariners’ visit to the Twin Cities as it readies to face the Minnesota Twins. For that game, Ianniello is backing the visitors on the moneyline at +116 on FanDuel. “No team in baseball was better in high-leverage situations than the Mariners,” Ianniello says. “They had a .361 weighted on-base average and 136 weighted runs created average in high-leverage situations.” Add in the strength of starting pitcher Chris Flexen, who will take the mound Monday, and Ianniello believes the Mariners will continue their positive start to the season.
