Michelle Carter, 25, has been seen for the first time since being released from jail in January 2020, after serving 11 months for the infamous “texting suicide” case. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the death of her then-boyfriend Conrad Roy in 2014. Her story has been dramatized in the Hulu series “The Girl From Plainville,” with Elle Fanning playing Carter, Colton Ryan playing Conrad Roy, and Chloe Sevigny playing Lynn Roy, Conrad’s mother. Carter made headlines in 2014 and 2015 when a Massachusetts judge ruled that her words (through texting and phone calls) coerced 18-year-old Roy into dying by suicide. She was sentenced to 15 months in prison, which she served from February 2019 to January 2020 —she got released 3 months early due to good conduct. In addition to “The Girl From Plainville,” Carter and Roy’s story has also been covered in the 2019 HBO documentary, “I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth Vs. Michelle Carter.” Carter has kept a low profile since her sentence, but she was spotted doing yard work outside of her home. “It was challenging to live in that headspace for five months [while filming]. It was tough material,” Sevigny, 47, told The Post. “But, we would try to find moments of levity within the show and offscreen,” she said. “The Girl from Plainville” is now streaming on Hulu, with new episodes out on Thursdays.
