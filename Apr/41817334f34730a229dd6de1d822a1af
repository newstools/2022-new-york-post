One of the world’s biggest rivalries will be played Tuesday when Liverpool hosts Manchester United in a huge Premier League showdown at Anfield. The fixture comes at a crucial time for these clubs, with both seeking to accomplish different domestic goals. For the Reds, their eyes are on a league title with seven games to play. Liverpool sits just a point behind league leaders Manchester City in the table. As for the Red Devils, they were given a lifeline in the race for the top four as Tottenham and Arsenal both lost at the weekend. United now resides in fifth place, just three points behind Spurs in the tight standings. It would be incredibly bold to think that United had a quality chance of coming out of this game with a point or more, and the odds reflect that. Expecting United to put up a big fight in this game may not be the craziest thing in the world, but these teams aren’t in the same stratosphere right now. Liverpool hasn’t been beaten in the league since the start of 2022, while United has lost three games in that span. Even worse for United, this game is being played in an impossible location for visitors. Liverpool hasn’t been beaten in the league at Anfield this year, and its 1.78 expected-goals-per-game (xG) differential at home is just .02 short of Man City for best in the league. United has a -0.12 xG/game differential on the road in the EPL and is heading in a completely different direction to its most-hated rival. Look for Liverpool to keep its title-chasing form alive. The play: Liverpool -1.25 (Asian handicap, -115).
