“I’m asking for justice for Kade,” Suzette Lewin sobbed Monday, clutching a photo her son, 12, shot dead while eating in a car Thursday. Mayor Eric Adams, at her side, asked, “Whose child is next?” How many more innocent kids must die before the Legislature gets serious about reversing New York’s soaring crime? Kade Lewin’s pointless death follows the 3-year-old girl hit by gunfire last month outside a Brownsville day-care center, the 7-year-old grazed by a bullet in Coney Island and the 11-month-old nicked by a stray bullet in The Bronx in January. Yet the Democratic majorities in both chambers are seeing how little of Gov. Kathy Hochul’s already-insufficient criminal-justice fixes they’ll accept. What does Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn have to say to Suzette Lewin, her constituent? The mayor reports that his new anti-gun unit found that 70% of its gun-wielding arrestees had a prior criminal history: The perps released on lesser charges escalate. New York’s lawmakers face a simple choice: Give judges the discretion to order remand for offenders they deem dangerous, or let the streets fill with the blood of children.
