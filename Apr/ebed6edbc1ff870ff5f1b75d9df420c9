The gun used by the monster who opened fire on a crowded Brooklyn subway Tuesday jammed in the midst of the bloodshed — preventing him from causing more carnage, law enforcement sources told The Post. Investigators recovered the jammed Glock and two extended magazines at the scene of the shooting, which happened aboard a Manhattan-bound N train just as it was pulling into the 36th Street station in Sunset Park just after 8:20 a.m. “It was lucky that it jammed because we could be talking about a lot more people in hospitals or worse,” a law enforcement source said. “Dozens more people would have been wounded or more seriously injured.” At least 29 people were wounded in the incident, including 10 people who were shot, but miraculously, none of them are facing life-threatening injuries, the NYPD said. The suspect, who is still in the wind, was using a rolling milk crate-type carrier to cart around his stuff, sources added. A slew of weapons, including a hatchet, a can of pepper spray, two gas canisters, one bag of fireworks, smoke grenades and gasoline were also recovered at the scene, but it’s not immediately clear if they all belonged to the suspect.
