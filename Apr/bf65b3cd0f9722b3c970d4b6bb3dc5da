A shocking new video shows the moment an unknown firebug walks into a Brooklyn club and empties out a can of gasoline before setting the joint ablaze. The footage released Wednesday shows the arsonist, wearing a hoodie, as they dump the gasoline on the ground. The suspect then puts a lighter to the gas and a conflagration erupts on camera. The fire was set Sunday night in the Rash nightclub in Bushwick and destroyed much of the club with one of the owners previously telling The Post “very little of it will be salvageable.” The blaze sent two women — a bartender and a DJ — to the hospital. A bouncer, who briefly caught on fire, also sought medical treatment, according to the owners. The two women hospitalized, a 25-year-old and 23-year-old, suffered minor burns to their shoulders and other parts of the body. They were treated at Wyckoff Hospital. Cops were searching for the arsonist on Wednesday.
