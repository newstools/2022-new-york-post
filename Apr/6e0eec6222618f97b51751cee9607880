A “juvenile suspect” was arrested Tuesday in connection to the murder of a 10-year-old Wisconsin girl whose body was found near a walking trail a day after she was reported missing, police said. Chippewa Falls Police Chief Matthew Kelm said the suspect knew the victim, Lily Peters, and that the public was no longer in danger, according to a press conference recorded by KMSP-TV. “While nothing will bring Lily Peters back or change what happened, we are very grateful to be able to deliver this news for the family and for the community,” Kelm said of the arrest. Peters was reported missing by her father on Sunday night. The fourth-grader’s body was discovered Monday morning in a wooded area not far from her aunt’s home in Chippewa Falls, according to police. No information was provided Tuesday about the underage suspect, including the person’s age, gender or relationship. Charges were not immediately announced. Kelm thanked the tight-knit community of 14,000 for sending in over 200 tips, which he said “were critical in solving this case.”
