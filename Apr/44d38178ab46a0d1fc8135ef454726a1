Cops are trying to piece together the final moments of Orsolya Gaal, the Queens mom who was stabbed to death, stuffed into a duffel bag and dragged from her home last weekend. The 51-year-old mother of two had spent a night out before she was stabbed almost 60 times inside of the family’s Forest Hills home at about 12:40 a.m. on Saturday. Her body was found in the hockey bag half-mile from her home by a man taking his dog for a walk. What happened in the hours leading up to her brutal slaying remains largely a mystery. Gaal started the day early Friday in the backyard of her Juno Street home, then went to Manhattan’s Lincoln Center that evening with friends before she was spotted alone at a Queens bar later that evening. Law enforcement officials believe Gaal’s killer was an acquaintance who didn’t plan the murder in advance. 1. Friday morning: The 51-year-old married mom of two putters around her back yard at 72-24 Juno St. in Forest Hills, Queens. 2. Late Friday into Saturday, sometime before 12:40 a.m.: Gaal arrives home, followed by her killer. 3. Saturday around 4:30 a.m.: Video surveillance from a neighborhood doorbell camera at 100-18 75th Ave. captures a mysterious figure rolling the duffel bag down the street. 4. Saturday around 8 a.m.: Glenn Van Nostrand, a local resident walking his two dogs near Metropolitan Avenue and the Jackie Robinson Parkway, discovers the bloodied duffel bag at the scene and calls the cops. Investigators are now looking to question an apparent ex-lover who knew where a spare key was hidden at the property and wouldn’t have had to force his way into the Tudor-style house.
