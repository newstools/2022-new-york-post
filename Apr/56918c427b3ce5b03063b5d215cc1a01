After just one season at NBC, it is possible Drew Brees could be on the move to Fox Sports, The Post has learned. Fox’s No. 1 game analyst role continues to be unoccupied after Troy Aikman fled for ESPN and a five-year, $90 million contract. While Greg Olsen remains the leading in-house candidate to become Fox Sports’ No. 1 NFL game analyst, sources say that Brees is in the mix. Even if Brees leaves NBC for Fox, Olsen could still be promoted to Fox’s lead team with Kevin Burkhardt. In that scenario, Brees would team with Joe Davis or Adam Amin on the No. 2 team. Brees and Olsen were both rookie NFL analysts last year. The Post previously reported that Burkhardt will replace Joe Buck as Fox’s lead NFL game caller. Buck followed Aikman to ESPN and “Monday Night Football.” In his first season at NBC, Brees grew to enjoy games more than the studio, according to sources. Amazon also likes Brees, which could create the possibility of him doing work on “Thursday Night Football” and then calling games for Fox on Sundays. NBC brought in Brees believing he could be its future No. 1 NFL game analyst, but then extended Cris Collinsworth’s contract to call “Sunday Night Football” games, leaving Brees with the opportunity to continue to analyze Notre Dame home games, a few NFL games and the weekly Sunday night studio show. With Brees’ preference to be on games, Fox could be an alluring possibility. Despite the playoff game that Brees struggled on with Mike Tirico, Fox Sports executives think Brees still has potential, according to sources. Brees does have the big-name quarterback pedigree that is similar to Aikman and CBS’ Tony Romo. One other note about Fox and NBC: they have been working closely together on the USFL. Plus, NBC just allowed Dale Earnhardt Jr. to work Talladega for Fox on Sunday. Could a Fox-NBC Brees deal be next? Both Fox and NBC declined comment.
