His wiggling sent them giggling. A 9-year-old boy stole the show with some “hilarious” dance moves during a recent school performance. Third-grader Tripp Thomure was on stage with his Ralls County Elementary School class in Center, Missouri, when he let the music take control. The elementary schoolers were in the middle of a choreographed song and dance routine when they were allowed to freestyle and show off their moves. Lindsey Woodhurst, 30, captured the viral moment as her young son began writhing and gyrating his hips. She then shared his moves on TikTok with a caption that read: “When your son breaks it down in front of the whole school.” The crowd went wild and erupted in laughter as Tripp danced around doing “the sprinkler” and other priceless moves with a serious look on his face. Woodhurst found the moment hysterical and said the viral moment is very telling of who her son is. “He likes to show off his dance moves! Tripp is so original and the video really shows his personality,” she told South West News Service. “He lives life to the fullest.” Much to Thomure’s delight, the TikTok clip has gone viral with more than 8 million views, over 550,000 likes and nearly 7,800 comments. Newfound fans praised the “adorable” tyke for his “hilarious” and “hysterical” choreography, his “confidence” and more. “He’s always wanted to be TikTok famous and now he’s going to get it done!” his mother shared. “So many commenters have said how funny he is. People online have been encouraging him to just keep being himself.” One of those commenters was none other than 63-year-old actor Kevin Bacon, who famously could not contain his own explosive moves in the 1984 classic dance film “Footloose.” “Nothing to be ashamed of, just some great moves,” Bacon noted on TikTok, adding a thumbs-up emoji.
