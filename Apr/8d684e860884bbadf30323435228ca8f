Mayor Eric Adams plans to appoint the current director of Washington DC’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles to lead New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, he announced Thursday. David Do has led DC’s taxi regulator since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile. He previously led that city’s Office of Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs. Adams in a statement called Do “groundbreaking” and “supremely qualified and capable.” If approved by the City Council, Do would succeed Adams’ first pick for the job, ex-TLC Chair Aloysee Heredia-Jarmoszuk, who resigned from the post in March after The Post revealed she’d gone on an expletive-laden tirade at a meeting of 80 commission employees. Heredia-Jarmoszuk, who Adams kept on from Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, was caught on tape snapping at staff and spewing profanities. “Someone is messing around with the mute and don’t think I won’t figure it out who it is,” Heredia Jarmoszuk growled in one of the videos. “I will f–king come for you.” She later expressed regret in an emailed statement to The Post. Taxi and for-hire vehicle workers have suffered devastating losses in recent years due to both COVID-19 and a pre-pandemic collapse of the taxi medallion market. Drivers became plagued by massive debts after the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission knowingly misled them into taking on loans to buy yellow cabs at inflated costs while New York City raked in $855 million from the sales, the state attorney general’s office found. In a statement shared by City Hall, Bhairavi Desai of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance called Do “an experienced regulator rooting in transportation policy.” The DC Department of For-Hire Vehicles regulates around 1,600 taxis and 2,600 app-based ride-hail drivers. New York’s TLC, in comparison, has over 200,000 licensees.
