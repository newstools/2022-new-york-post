Two men exchanged gunfire in a broad-daylight Queens shootout this week, new video shows. One of the gunmen was walking on Linden Boulevard near 194th Street in St. Albans around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday when he came face-to-face with two other people, according to the clip, released by the NYPD later that evening. He’s shown stepping into the street, behind a parked white SUV, apparently squaring off with the duo, before he pulled out a gun and opened fire. One of the other men immediately fired back before all three ran off, the footage shows. The man who allegedly fired first fled in a silver Honda Accord, but briefly returned to the scene to pick up belongings he had dropped during the gunplay, cops said. The second alleged shooter took off in a black Acura 4-door sedan driven by another person, police said. No injuries were reported, but the white SUV shown in the video sustained gunfire damage, cops said. The shootout appeared to stem from a “chance encounter between two rivals,” police said. No arrests had been made by Wednesday morning.
