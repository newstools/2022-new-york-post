Political comic Bill Maher mocked how several major news outlets have only just come around to reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop, saying the lack of coverage is “why people don’t trust the media.” Maher said left-leaning media ignored the laptop because it wasn’t “part of their narrative” when The Post published its first, exclusive report on the topic in 2020. “It looks like the left-wing media has buried the story because it wasn’t part of their narrative and that’s why people don’t trust the media,” Maher said on Friday’s episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher.” The comments came after the New York Times verified the laptop just last month. The initial coverage had detailed how Hunter leveraged the political clout of his father Joe Biden to make money overseas. The exclusive Post report was published less than a month before Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election, but led to a ban of the story on social media platforms and several platforms questioning the validity of the story. Maher also lumped The Post into a partisan view of media outlets, referring to it as “a Republican paper” as he noted how long it took other outlets to acknowledge the laptop. “The New York Post got ahold of what was in the computer, and um, because the New York Post is a Republican paper and the New York Times and Washington Post are the Democrat paper. That’s where were are again kind of.” “And the Republican paper, Twitter canceled their account. Can’t even report on this story.” “And now two years later, the New York Times and the Washington Post have come around to say ‘okay there was something there.'”
