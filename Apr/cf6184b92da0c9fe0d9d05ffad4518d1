Was John Sterling high, far and gone? The legendary Yankees radio announcer made a hilarious gaffe during Wednesday’s 6-4 loss to the Blue Jays, calling a Giancarlo Stanton home run that wasn’t. Down in the eighth inning, Stanton drove a ball to left field that appeared off the bat to have a chance to tie the game. But Toronto left fielder Raimel Tapia made the catch at the warning track, ending the inning. Just don’t tell Sterling that. “It is high! It is far! It is gone! …but caught,” Sterling exclaimed as the play was made, clearly unaware that the ball had stayed in the park until Tapia turned and started running back towards the dugout. It’s hard to blame Sterling for thinking Stanton had hit a dinger off the bat, as everyone from the camera crew to the fans immediately reacted as such. “Boy, I thought that was gone,” Sterling said. “So Stanton got close, sent Tapia back to the wall to make the catch, and the Yankees come up just empty.” The Yankees fell to 3-3 with the loss, as Vladimir Guerrero tortured New York to the tune of three home runs in the game.
