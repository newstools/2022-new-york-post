An MTA station worker was injured in an unprovoked attack at a Brooklyn subway station on Sunday, NYPD said. The booth attendant was roping off the turnstile in the mezzanine at Fulton Street and Franklin Avenue on the C line at around 11:30 a.m. when a man walked up and hit her, an NYPD spokesman said. The 37-year-old woman was taken to Brooklyn Hospital for treatment for “minor bruising” on her face, police said. Her assailant fled and has not been arrested.
