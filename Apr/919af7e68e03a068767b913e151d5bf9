Just call him Johnny Air Hockey. Former Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel enjoyed a playful night out with gal pal Kenzie Werner on Tuesday, when the twosome faced off in a round of air hockey. “GOALLLLLLLL @kenziewernerx,” Manziel, 29, posted in an Instagram Story, which featured Werner at the opposite end of the table. The beauty specialist later quipped on her page, “He cheated.” Later in the night, Werner also shared a cozy photo of the pair at a Dave & Buster’s. “Happy @jmanziel2,” she captioned the post on her Instagram Story. Manziel and Werner have been living it up in Miami as of late, with footage surfacing last week of the duo partying at a South Florida hot spot. Werner, who is based in Houston, also shared a video Tuesday on Instagram that featured her cuddling with Manziel aboard a boat. Although it’s unclear when Manziel first encountered Werner, TMZ reported last month how the two “spent time together in Scottsdale in the past.” Manziel was previously married to model Bri Tiesi, who initially split from the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback in early 2019. She filed for divorce that December after a year of marriage. Tiesi is currently expecting a baby with Nick Cannon. Meanwhile, Manziel, the Texas A&M alum who famously flamed out of the NFL in 2016, is gearing up for another stint in the Fan Controlled Football league. A former first-round pick, Manziel has been open in recent years about his struggles with substance abuse and his bipolar diagnosis.
