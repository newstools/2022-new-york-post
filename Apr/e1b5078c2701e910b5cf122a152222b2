It’s Wednesday, and you know what that means. Chris “Mad Dog” Russo’s weekly appearance on ESPN’s “First Take” always stirs up the emotions of avid sports media viewers, and this week was no exception. During a debate on whether Chris Paul deserves to be considered in the pantheon of NBA point guards, Russo said that Suns guard was “not Bob Cousy,” referencing the Celtics legend. JJ Redick, a former sharpshooter who has become an enjoyable NBA analyst for ESPN, stepped in to defend Paul’s honor. “Bob Cousy couldn’t dribble with his left hand,” Redick retorted. This did not change Russo’s mind, however. “Bob Cousy changed the game,” Russo responded. “Chris Paul didn’t change the game.” Redick then delivered a blow. “Bob Cousy won championships when there were eight teams in the NBA and you had to win two playoff series,” he said. Considering there isn’t a way to send Paul back to the 1950s or 1960s to compete or any way to transmogrify Cousy into someone who would have benefitted from modern training regimens, this debate can only be settled in hearts and minds.
