Two people are missing after a small plane crashed into the English Channel, according to reports. It’s unclear what caused the Piper PA-28 — which was headed for Le Touquet in northern France after taking off from the United Kingdom — to go down. British authorities were searching for the pilot and the passenger, along with French aircraft and boats.
