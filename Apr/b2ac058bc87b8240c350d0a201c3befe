Kim Basinger got emotional while discussing her agoraphobia, opening up that her phobia of leaving home has caused her debilitating issues. The 68-year-old discussed her struggles with the disease on a forthcoming episode of “Red Table Talk,” revealing she forgot how to drive a car. In a clip acquired by People, Basinger and her daughter Ireland Baldwin stopped by Jada Pinkett-Smith’s talk show where the “9 1/2 Weeks” star spoke about the many challenges she faced while battling agoraphobia. She said it was “really horrible” to suffer from the condition “as fiercely as I did during those years and not know what it was.” “I wouldn’t leave the house. I would no longer go to dinner,” Basinger said. Agoraphobia is classified as a type of anxiety disorder that causes an extreme amount of fear of certain situations, with many people even resisting leaving home. Basinger added that her agoraphobia felt “like something just completely shuts down within you and you have to relearn everything.” “I had to relearn to drive, and for many years I would not go through the tunnels at Malibu,” the “L.A Confidential” actress explained. “Everything used to make me nervous, like the glass [sliding] to open the door, or, ‘Where do I step to open the door?’ Everything became a big job to figure out how to do it.” “You live with a dry mouth all the time, you’re very shaky, you’re just so exhausted all the time,” she went on. As for Baldwin, 26, she got candid about her own health issues, revealing that she previously would “self-medicate with Xanax” and “drank excessively.” The model also admitted she “didn’t talk to” her mom or dad Alec Baldwin “for, like, a year” because of her problems. “I saw them here and there but I was so ashamed of what I had become and how I was living,” she said. “I just became this different person,” she said. “I was emaciated in every way; I was lifeless.” Basinger and Baldwin’s “Red Table Talk” episode drops Wednesday at 12 p.m. on Facebook Watch.
