The New York Rangers will be playing hockey in the month of May. The Blueshirts have clinched a playoff spot and are still in the running to win the Metropolitan division. A big part of their success has come thanks to Chris Kreider, who scored his 50th goal of the season at The Garden on Tuesday night. With seven games left in the regular season, what does this final stretch mean for Gerard Gallant’s squad? Who plays? Who rests? We had lots to discuss on a new episode of the “Up In The Blue Seats” podcast with Ron Duguay and Mollie Walker. The Post’s Larry Brooks drops by to discuss everything going on in Rangers land. Stay tuned until the end of the show for some drumming aka “Hart’s Beats” from my fellow producer Andrew Harts. Catch up on all episodes of “Up In The Blue Seats,” a New York Rangers podcast, by subscribing to the podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. New episodes drop Thursdays during the regular season.
