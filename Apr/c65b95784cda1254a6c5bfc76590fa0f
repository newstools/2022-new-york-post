Massive plumes of hot steam billowed into the sky in Greenwich Village after a major leak Saturday night. The FDNY called Con Edison around 9:48 p.m. requesting that service be turned off for three customers in the area of West 10th Street and Seventh Avenue, the utility told The Post. No injuries were reported, Con Ed said. Video shows several fire trucks and about a dozen firefighters and other responders at the scene — where steam fires rapidly out of the ground near a sidewalk. In the area around the main leak, steam also shot out from the sides of manhole covers in the street. Several passersby stopped to watch the spectacle. The FDNY did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for further details.
