Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of blowing up a huge oil depot in Russia on Friday in an airstrike — an attack that Ukraine denied carrying out. Russia had warned that the attack could hamper peace talks between the nations, which were due to continue Friday by video. But Ukraine officials scoffed they had nothing to do with the bombing. “For some reason, they say that we did it, but according to our information, this does not correspond to reality,” Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on national TV. Earlier in the day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Ukraine was to blame, according to Agence France-Presse. “Of course, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of negotiations,” Peskov added. Videos showed a flurry of rockets piercing the night sky in Belgorod at around 6 a.m. — and then a huge fire raging at the storage depot in the Russian city about 21 miles from Ukraine’s border. “The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine, which entered the territory of Russia at a low altitude,” Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram. Gladkov initially said two employees had been hurt but in an update noted, “There are no victims.” Russian energy giant Rosneft, which owns the facility, also said there had been no injuries. All workers were quickly evacuated, and at least 170 emergency workers were tackling the blaze, the company and local officials said. Locals in Belgorod quickly rushed to gas stations, forming huge lines, the regional governor said, while insisting that “there are no problems with fuel in the region and never will be.” Russia has reported shelling from Ukraine before. Earlier this week, a purported Ukrainian missile appeared to hit a temporary Russian military encampment outside Belgorod, according to Russia’s state-run news agency Tass. Russia also reported an incident last week that killed a military chaplain, but not an incursion of its airspace. The strike came after Ukraine’s defense ministry posted a social media video pretending to announce Oscars-style awards for its military successes. Best picture was given to video of Russia’s blown-up warship the Orsk as it brought military supplies to battle, while best cinematography was for “a kiss from Stinger,” with footage of a Russian helicopter being downed. The alleged airstrike Friday also came as Ukraine claimed that Russian troops had been forced to leave the heavily contaminated Chernobyl nuclear site. Ukraine’s state power company, Energoatom, said the pullout at Chernobyl came after soldiers received “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches in the forest in the exclusion zone around the closed plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it could not independently confirm the exposure claim. Ukraine said Friday it had retaken Bucha, a Kyiv suburb between Irpin and Hostomel. Ukrainian forces also retook Sloboda and Lukashivka, two villages along a main supply route between the besieged northern city of Chernihiv and capital Kyiv, according to Britain’s Defense Ministry.
