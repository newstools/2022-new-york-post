The reason Jojo Siwa did not attend the 2022 Kids’ Choice Awards is simple: she wasn’t invited. The “D.R.E.A.M.” singer, who has a complicated relationship with Nickelodeon, addressed her absence in an Instagram video Saturday night. “I’m not sure why, but I just didn’t get an invite,” Siwa said. She later posted a follow-up video on her Instagram Story, saying someone tagged her in a clip of her song “One Chance” being played at the award show. “So my song made it, but I didn’t,” Siwa laughed. Fans can think of a few possible reasons why the “Dancing With the Stars” alum didn’t get slimed. Siwa came out as gay last year, and recently confirmed she has new girlfriend. Siwa also chopped off her signature ponytail on Thursday and is now sporting a spunky pixie cut. Perhaps the recent changes are too risky for Nickelodeon’s young audience. Siwa supported fan’s response to her ignored invitation on Twitter by retweeting two users’ theories. “Being connected to a kids channel shouldn’t mean you have to stop being yourself,” one Twitter user wrote. Siwa called out Nickelodeon in September 2021, claiming the network would not let her perform the six original songs she recorded for the Paramount+ movie “The J Team” while on tour. “These are MY songs, MY voice, MY writing. Does this seem fair???” she wrote in a series of since-deleted tweets, according to Billboard. “Working for a company as a real human being treated as only a brand is fun until it’s not.”
