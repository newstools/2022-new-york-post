Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover has sent red-state politicians in a frenzy as they urge him to ditch the social-media platform’s California headquarters for new digs. Pols from places like Florida, Tennessee and Texas are lining up to make the world’s richest man offers to relocate to their states. “The invitation is open! Come on Elon,” Jacksonville, Florida Mayor Lenny Curry tweeted in an attempt to coax Musk to move Twitter’s headquarters from San Francisco to the Sunshine State. “FIN-tech is huge in Jacksonville. We’re really on the map of a lot of companies representing a lot of employees. A lot of access to talent in the area.” Curry’s longshot invitation followed a similar entreaty from Florida’s Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who tweeted a picture of a beautiful sunset at a beach to sweeten his pitch. “Hey ⁦@elonmusk⁩, this is what Team ⁦@Twitter⁩ could see ever [sic] evening if your HQ was in the Free State of Florida,” he wrote. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott leveraged Musk’s prior relocation of his primary companies — including Tesla and SpaceX — from California to the Lone Star State. “Bring Twitter to Texas to join Tesla, SpaceX & the Boring company,” Abbott tweeted to the tech titan after Twitter’s board announced his controversial $44 billion deal. Not to be outdone, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn also urged Musk to spurn Silicon Valley. “Elon should move Twitter HQ to the freedom-loving state of Tennessee!” Blackburn tweeted. Twitter is currently headquartered in San Francisco and employs more than 7,500 people at offices across the country and world. While Tesla still maintains a major presence in the Bay Area, Musk moved the company’s headquarters to Austin in 2021.
