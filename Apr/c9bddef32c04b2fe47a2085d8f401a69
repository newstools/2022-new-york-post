A brave 14-year-old girl scared away an intruder who broke into her Massachusetts home while she was alone with her 12-year-old sister, according to police and reports. Avery Cormier was awoken by the sound of a man breaking into her Middleborough home around 7:20 a.m. on Friday morning, according to police. Joseph Ridge, 58, of Bourne, was trying to burglarize the home when Avery grabbed two steak knives and confronted him, WCVB reported. Ridge, who is known to police and described as a “career criminal” was out on bail at the time, fled the home, cops said. Avery followed Ridge outside, and captured a video of his 2010 Chevy Silverado as he sped away. “I got him out of the house. I scared him. I took a video of his truck leaving so I have his license plate number,” the terrified teeen told a 911 dispatcher through sobs in an audio clip released by police. Avery asks the dispatcher if she can get off the line “so she can call her parents really fast,” but he convinces her to stay on the line. “I’m just really scared,” she tells the operator. A short time later, Ridge was arrested by Massachusetts State Police with Avery’s help and booked at the Middleborough Police Department. He was charged with aggravated breaking and entering during the day, trespassing and disorderly conduct, cops said. “I would like to commend the courageous actions of this girl. Even in the midst of an extremely scary event, her bravery assisted us in identifying the man believed to be responsible for breaking into her home,” Middleborough Chief Joseph  Perkins said in a statement.
