The Swedes swerved just in time. Alexander Skarsgård admitted that he “nearly ran over” Greta Thunberg while riding his bike through a recent protest in Stockholm, Sweden Skarsgård, 45, briefly described the close call — in which he almost hit the 19-year-old climate activist — in a recent interview with the UK Times. “I nearly ran over Greta Thunberg,” Skarsgård declared. “She’s how we sell our country now,” he added of his fellow Swedish patriot, who has been nominated three times for the Nobel Peace Prize. “And I almost hit her with my bike.” In a cheeky nod to his latest role in the “The Northman,” out April 15, Skarsgård quipped, “Greta is like a modern-day Viking — and, like Greta, the Vikings refused to fly.” In fact, Thunberg has been known to use air travel for her many global appearances, though she famously took a racing yacht — with no toilet or shower — to reach the US in 2019 before taking part in a United Nations summit. More recently the young activist has been seen pushing her School Strike for Climate campaign to protest the fossil fuel industry. Meanwhile, Skarsgård appears in the upcoming Viking epic, directed by Robert Eggers (“Lighthouse”), in which he plays the titular role adapted from the legend of Prince Amleth. The film sees the ripped Scandinavian actor as a blond, bearded warrior who goes on psychedelic drug-fueled raids to destroy Slavic communities as he seeks to avenge his murdered father.
