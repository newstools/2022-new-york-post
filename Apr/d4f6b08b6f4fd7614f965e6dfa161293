With cybercrime on the rise, it’s important to know if your information has been breached – here’s how. Today, cybercriminals target our data in a wide variety of ways: fake texts, malware-laden links, and even fraudulent mail that impersonates government officials. Sometimes, cyberattacks can be so discreet that you have no idea your device is even affected. Hackers can target portals of information like your Gmail, Facebook, and iCloud accounts. Through these accounts, they can then access sensitive information like bank details. However, there are certain signs you can keep your eyes open for – and the sooner you learn these red flags, the quicker you can tackle them. If your phone, laptop, or desktop starts acting glitchy or sluggish, that could mean you have been hacked. Similarly, if your device is getting inundated with fake warnings or suspicious-looking browser pop-ups, you may be a victim of a malware attack. Another tell-tale sign is if your browser is constantly redirected to websites without you initiating it. If your browser also begins displaying X-rated pop-ups, then your device may be the victim of malicious software. Are your friends receiving random messages from your Facebook account? That’s a good indication that your social media account has been breached. Furthermore, if your browser or device notifies you that something has been compromised, then it likely has been. One of the easiest ways to relieve your device of a virus or malware is to undergo a factory reset. This is a simple procedure that completely cleans your device’s internal storage. You can also run an anti-virus program to clear out the malware, though most of these services will cost you money. If the virus attacking your device is especially sophisticated, you may need to take it to a professional cybersecurity expert.
