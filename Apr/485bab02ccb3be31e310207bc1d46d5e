Evan Neal’s personal coach slammed a report that claims the offensive tackle has a “medical issue” just days before he is projected to go in the top 10 of the 2022 NFL Draft. “FAKE NEWS!” offensive line coach Duke Manyweather tweeted Tuesday, in response to a report that said some teams “medically flunked” the Alabama product, who could be a target of the Giants at Nos. 5 or 7 overall. “Neal WAS NOT a medical re-check and was medically cleared at combine. Dude hasn’t missed a workout since the national Championship!” Manyweather went on to tweet a number of videos showing Neal dominating Georgia defensive end Travon Walker — another top draft prospect who’s now the favorite to go No. 1 overall to the Jaguars — in the national title game. Pro Football Talk confirmed that Neal was not asked to return to Indianapolis for the Scouting Combine’s medical re-check. Neal missed only one game in college, and that was due to COVID. On Tuesday, Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer said “a handful of teams” have raised knee and hip issues about Neal, and that “a good number of clubs” are considering him to be a  notable medical risk. Neal is one of three offensive tackles, along with Ikem Ekwonu and Charles Cross, widely predicted to go in the top 10.
