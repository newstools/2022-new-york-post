Alongside the best Mother’s Day gifts you can buy on Amazon, we cobbled together the 27 best last-minute Mother’s Day gifts for 2022 that’ll take the stress out of online shopping. From Prime shipping-eligible items to savvy snags on cookware and fine jewelry before the sweet springy day, mom will be thrilled to receive one of these top gems. Browse our exclusive recommendations below. With some of these ideas, you may want to pick up a bouquet from one of our favorite flower delivery services to add a special touch. After reviewing the Always Pan, we’ve been in love ever since, namely because the pan — which comes in many different colorways — replaces eight pieces of cookware. Our Place offers free shipping (four to 14 business days), along with two or three-day expedited options. As one of our favorite smart home essentials, mom will love the Amazon Echo Show 8, whether it’s for streaming her favorite artists while getting ready for date night or displaying Pinterest recipes for a weeknight dinner. For $100, it’s a worthwhile investment. If you’re not already on high alert for Brooklinen’s popular Waffle Robe, it’s about time. Available in many colors, this blush will make mom happy, breathable and picture-perfect for lounging in the house. Not to mention, it’s one of our favorite robes. Brooklinen offers free shipping (typically takes up to four days) and expedited options as well at checkout. With the Click & Grow Indoor Herb Garden Kit, mom never has to worry about outdoor temps or sharpening her green thumb. The bundle includes pods, helps you grow fresh basil, rosemary and more from your kitchen and is one of our favorite products we reviewed. If the woman you’re gifting to enjoys music, there’s nothing like a $10/month subscription to make it streamable. The platform has curated playlists, a sleek interface and is worth the affordable buy for Mother’s Day. For the practical mom, we can’t recommend Maison d’ Hermine’s Colmar Wraparound Oven Mitt enough. Not only is it one of our most-used kitchen essentials, but it has the most spring-forward pattern we’ve seen. Dyson is taking the hair world by storm. For a sweet splurge mom likely won’t gift herself, Dyson’s Supersonic Hair Dryer makes an unbeatable gift to help create salon-like blowouts at home (perhaps with one of the best expert-recommended anti-frizz products). Dyson offers free shipping (typically takes five to seven days), while Nordstrom offers free standard shipping (typically five business days), two-day shipping for $12 and next-day shipping for $20. As one of our favorite French press coffee makers (and, one of Amazon’s top selections), Bodum’s Charmbord is unmatched. It makes a great less-than-$50 gift and pairs well with some ground coffee from Atlas Coffee Club to keep mom caffeinated. Looking for a pair of designer sunglasses without the high price ticket? Amelia E. Hepburn’s classic pair has a modern edge and a match-all look that’ll take mom to summer in style. For just $52 right now, it’s worthy of this year’s Mother’s Day gift. GlassesUSA offers expedited shipping (typically three business days) for select pairs. As one of the best e-readers on the market, there’s no surprise Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite makes a lovely gift: it’s of-age, perfect for the bookworm you know and doesn’t produce a strong glare. Not to mention, a membership to Audible pairs well with this item. If mom loves to cook, The Modern Proper cookbook is too good to pass up. It’s filled with gorgeous photos, practical tips and, most importantly, delicious recipes that are simple for even the novice cook to whip together. Long story short, mom will love it. Barbour’s Babbity Reversible Rain Jacket is a splurge, but a good one at that. As one of our favorite rain jackets, it’s prim-and-polished, put-together and practical for breezy weather. Oh, and that button detailing is simply divine. Bloomingdale’s offers standard, premium and express shipping at checkout, depending on the item. Olaplex’s No. 4 is one of the best shampoos we tested this year, with its No. 5 a strong formula to follow. After the brand had a recent reformulation, we can’t stop resorting to both for silky-soft hair. It’s also a consistent Amazon best-seller. Pajamas are always a great gift to receive, and what better than a silk-designed three-piece set that looks like something Kate Middleton would wear to bed? For less than $30, the pattern and style makes it one of our favorite editions to this list. OK, this is one of those items that you simply need to add-to-cart ASAP. Ideal for Mother’s Day breakfast in bed, Wafles & Dinges is a premium delight that anyone would love (and the best shipment to come to your door quickly). Speaking of breakfast in bed, Pipishell’s Bamboo Bed Tray is a great staple to have, especially if you want to treat mom on her special day. It also makes a great laptop stand for the WFH grind. All we can say about Business & Pleasure Co.’s Holiday Beach Umbrella is wow. Great for serving as your go-to beach umbrella or to adorn backyard (perhaps with some new patio furniture), this frilly, adorable piece will keep mom cool and feeling like a vacationer. Business & Pleasure Co. offers quick, up-to-two-day shipping for all orders. Kendra Scott’s 14K Gold-Plated Elisa Pendant is dainty, pairs well with any outfit and is a stellar option for Mother’s Day any woman will love. Not to mention, it’s less than $100 and one of our favorite jewelry brands. Looking for one of the best air fryers on Amazon? Start by looking at Cosori’s Air Fryer, clad with a 100-recipe-filled cookbook. It’s easy to use, a staple for quick and hearty meals and a perfect gift if the woman in your life is looking for a new kitchen gadget. How cute are Anthropologie’s flower-embossed gardening gloves? They make us want to tend to our flowers and plants, especially with its buckle strap detailing and practical charm. For $40, mom will be happy. Anthropologie offers free shipping (typically four to eight business days), express shipping (two to three business days) for $10 and overnight shipping for $15. As one of our favorite skincare brands for eye creams and vitamin C serums, Tatcha’s Japanese ingredient-infused blend makes the ideal self-care gift. In this set, you’ll receive a cleanser, moisturizer and more. For the mom that’s constantly on-the-go, a Hydro Flask is a dynamite grab if she doesn’t already have it. It’s available in many colors, is less than $40 and built to last many years. For summertime-ready shoes, it’s worth picking up Amazon Essentials’ Two-Strapped Heel Sandal. They pair well with our favorite white dresses and work dresses alike and will soon become a wardrobe essential upon ordering. For the mom who has everything, MasterClass is a great subscription gift to learn from the pros. From Christina Aguilera’s vocal class to Gordon Ramsay’s cooking class, we love using this to sharpen our minds (and our skills). Plus, it’s one of our favorite online class platforms. Ah, we have much to thank this robot vacuum for. Not only does it make our lives easier but it truly has changed our Sunday cleaning game (much like our favorite house cleaning products). It’s one of our favorite vacuums, too. Some may say gift cards are thoughtless, but we think they’re appreciated. Choose your amount, choose your gift box and voila: your giftee will have a shopping spree to the retailer that sells practically everything. For an unbeatable work tote, Long Champ takes the cake. It’s less than $200, comes in beautiful hues and is sturdy for long commutes and overnight trips alike. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
