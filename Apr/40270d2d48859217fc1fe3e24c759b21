Even at a cool $30,000 per month, this triplex brownstone rental isn’t the most expensive in Manhattan’s tony Upper West Side — though it is up there. But dressed with pink walls, pink curtains and even a pink quartz kitchen countertop, it certainly is the neighborhood’s most chromatic. At 251 W. 76th St., a property comes with all those colorful features and more — and it’s now looking for a deep-pocketed tenant to call it home. Designed by Keith Baltimore, a flip through its listing images also shows pink-tone fireplaces, pink baseboards, pink bedding and pink light fixtures. The drive: To steer clear of the sterile white common in modern homes. “The owner wanted more character and imagination,” said Triplemint listing agent Shane Boyle, who reps the rental alongside Aaron Seawood. “The pink is bold, conveys lightness and warmth at the same time, and allows guests and anyone who lives in the space to experience life through rose-colored glasses.” The home has two (or flexible three) bedrooms, three full bathrooms and a powder room with a bold Christian Lacroix floral wallpaper across 3,000 square feet. But apart from the pretty-in-pink look, the bones additionally include 12-foot-tall ceilings, herringbone hardwood floors and 15-inch-wide moldings. Apart from the pink island, the kitchen has custom floor-to-ceiling cabinetry, plus a Lacanche range with three ovens and seven gas burners. But for more color, other areas of the home also deliver. The dining room has purple seat cushions atop a rug with pink and purple designs, and tropical wallpaper on the garden level. Other perks include bars for entertaining guests, one of which stands in a lower-level entertainment room — as well as a terrace, a rear garden and a Juliet balcony in the master suite.
