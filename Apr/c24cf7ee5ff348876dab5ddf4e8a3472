An unhinged man was taken into police custody early Saturday morning after barging into the lobby of the 67th Precinct in Brooklyn with a knife, the NYPD said. The unidentified man entered the East Flatbush station house around 1 a.m. and began making a series of “claims” and “requests,” cops said. The nature of his rants were unknown. Police said the man was taken into custody and transported into Kings County Hospital. Charges against him are pending. No injuries were reported during the unsettling incident.
