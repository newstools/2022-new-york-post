Josh Allen and longtime girlfriend Brittany Williams are loving their West Coast offseason. The Bills quarterback, 25, enjoyed a dinner date at Catch LA this week with Williams, who posted about their evening Thursday on her Instagram Story. “About last night,” Williams captioned the video, later adding, “@joshallenqb always ruining the food videos but I love it.” For their night out in West Hollywood, Calif., Williams paired her white crop top with a pink mini skirt and green heels, while Allen rocked maroon slacks, a dark jacket, a white T-shirt, and matching sneakers. Allen, who has been dating Williams long before Buffalo selected him seventh overall in 2018, is preparing for his fifth NFL season following a heartbreaking playoff exit in January. The Bills faced the Chiefs in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, with Allen and Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes delivering an epic duel for the ages. When the game went into overtime, the Chiefs won the coin toss and the Bills’ offense never saw the ball again. Allen was among the few not complaining about the overtimes rules after the game, in which the first team to score a touchdown wins. In this case, the Chiefs were first to get the ball and score a touchdown. “The rules are what they are, and I can’t complain about that because if it was the other way around, we’d be celebrating, too,” Allen said after his team’s 42-36 loss. “So, it is what it is at this point. We didn’t make enough plays tonight.” In the wake of the uproar over the game’s result, NFL owners approved to modify the overtime rule in March, which would ensure possession for both teams in playoff games. In the meantime, it appears Allen is going to soak up the rest of his offseason out West with Williams before returning home to Buffalo.
