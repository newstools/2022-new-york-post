A person was airlifted to the hospital after setting themselves on fire in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington DC on Friday evening, officials said. The disturbing incident took place at about 6:30 p.m. on the plaza in front of the court building, according to Supreme Court Public Information Officer Patricia McCabe. After igniting themselves, the person was taken in a medical helicopter to a local hospital. Officials did not disclose the individual’s condition. No other injuries were reported. The area remained closed for investigation two hours after the incident, but McCabe confirmed “this is not a public safety issue.” The person’s motivation was unclear. The Supreme Court Police, US Capitol Police, and MPD responded to the scene. Earlier in the day, four people were shot when a gunman suddenly opened fire in a residential area in the Northwest section of the city, forcing residents and schools to lockdown and shelter in place. Police are still searching for the suspect.
