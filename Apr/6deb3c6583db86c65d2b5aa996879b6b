There were no winners in Powerball’s whopping $400 million drawing on Saturday — the 29th consecutive drawing without a winning ticket. The next drawing will be on Monday as the jackpot climbs to $421 million. Saturday’s winning numbers are: 10, 39, 47, 49, 56.  The Powerball number is 8. Ticket purchasers have a 1 in about 25 chance of winning a prize, but a lofty 1 in 292,201,338 chance of winning the jackpot, according to Powerball. Saturday’s drawing marks Powerball’s 30th anniversary week since the first tickets were sold on April 19, 1992, with the drawing held three days later on April 22. The Powerball jackpot last hit in Connecticut in the Feb. 14 drawing, when a single ticket got a lucky winner $185.3 million, according to Powerball. Since then, there have been 28 drawings in a row without a jackpot winner. The jackpot was only hit one other time this year when two tickets sold in California and Wisconsin split a $632 million prize on Jan. 5 — the seventh-largest jackpot in Powerball history. Powerball holds the world record for the largest jackpot of $1.586 billion which was shared by winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in 2016.
