What’s in a name? An animal park in Bavaria is changing the name of one of its most popular pigs. A Russian boar named Putin will now be known as Eberhofer after 2,700 suggestions were tallied. The park is also looking to rename a jackal who fell in love, turned his back on his family and relocated to the other side of the park. With votes still pouring in the name Harry Markle has a sizable lead. Former Met Steven Matz spent one season in Toronto (or was it Buffalo, or was it Dunedin) and now the bluebird is a redbird. Matz’s debut was a disaster (seven runs, three innings) but he rebounded, blanking the Brewers over 5 ²/₃. The Cards are in Cincinnati. At 22 years old, Reds rookie Hunter Greene, is well, green, but has shown promise, allowing five runs over 10 ¹/₃. This will be Greene’s first start at home. We will back the Cards for 10 units. Our Citi Field streak is over. The Mets outhit the Giants, Carlos Carrasco outpitched Anthony DeSclafani, and the Mets won, 6-2. Still up +40 mccoveys.
