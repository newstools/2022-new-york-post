Tyson Fury’s latest knockout to remain undefeated didn’t come without controversy. Dillian Whyte, who lost the heavyweight title bout on Saturday via a sixth-round TKO, claims Fury committed an “illegal” shove right after landing an uppercut that sent Whyte to the canvas. After managing to get back on his feet, the 34-year-old stumbled toward the ropes, prompting the referee to stop the fight in the final seconds of the round. “[When] the uppercut landed I was buzzed, but obviously I was trying to regather my senses and he proper full-on pushed me,” Whyte said in a sit-down with Sky Sports, fully extending both of his arms to make his point. “I fell over and hit my head on the canvas, which is illegal. This ain’t wrestling. This is boxing, you know what I mean? But as usual, they let Fury do what he wants and get away with it. I should’ve been allowed extra time to recover and then carried on fighting.” Fury, 33, did appear to shove Whyte after connecting with the vicious uppercut. After retaining the WBC and The Ring heavyweight titles to move to 32-0-1, Fury said that could have been his last fight. “This might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,” said Fury, whose only blemish on his record is a split-decision draw in his first fight against Deontay Wilder in 2018. Fury went on to beat Wilder twice. Whyte, however, has his eyes on a rematch. “I hope he doesn’t retire because I want another go,” Whyte told Sky Sports.
