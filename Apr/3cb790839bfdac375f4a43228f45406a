Two key executives who were hired to launch former President Donald Trump’s social media startup Truth Social have resigned — the latest sign of turmoil at the nascent venture that has struggled to get off the ground. Josh Adams, the chief of technology, and Billy Boozer, the head of product development, stepped down from their posts, Reuters reported on Monday. The specific circumstances behind the executives’ resignations — or whether they have been replaced or their duties reassigned — couldn’t immediately be determined, according to the report. It also remains unclear whether Adams and Boozer still work on the venture in a different capacity after quitting their executive posts. The departures followed the troubled launch of the company’s iPhone app on Feb. 20. Weeks later, many users remain on a waiting list, unable to access the platform. Trump Media & Technology Group chief executive Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, said publicly that the company aimed to make the app fully operational within the United States by the end of March. The company has an app for iPhones but none for Android phones, which make up more than 40% of the US market, though the company has advertised seeking an engineer to build one. The exit of two executives critical to the app launch efforts could imperil the company’s progress as it tries to prove it can compete with mainstream platforms such as Twitter, said two people familiar with the company. Like Twitter, Trump’s platform offers users the chance to connect and share their thoughts.
