With five-time Masters winner Tiger Woods looking increasingly likely to appear in this week’s Masters, sportsbooks are jumping to offer specials on the Big Cat. Woods, a five-time Masters champ, practiced last week at Augusta – igniting speculation – then returned Sunday and Monday for more prep. He meets with the media on Tuesday morning, and despite labeling it a “game-time decision,” most believe that Woods is gearing up to play. Woods suffered a leg injury in Feb. 2021 after completing his hosting duties for the Genesis Invitational, forcing him to miss the 2021 Masters and, most crucially, out of professional golf since. The last time Woods appeared at a sanctioned PGA Tour event was the December PNC Championship alongside his 13-year-old son, Charlie, but his last official stroke-play event was the 2020 Masters in November of that year. So, although it may be a steep mountain to climb for Woods next week, here are some of the specials currently being offered if you’re a Tiger fan and are looking for a risk-free bet on the Stanford product.
