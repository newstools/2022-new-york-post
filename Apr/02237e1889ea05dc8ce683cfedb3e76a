Baker Mayfield might be taking his talents to Carolina. ESPN’s Kimberley Martin first reported that the Panthers’ pursuit of the Browns’ quarterback continues to “heat up,” and Joseph Person of The Athletic followed with confirmation of “active talks” between the teams. The Panthers are the team that has made the most sense for Mayfield and interest has been rumored for weeks. He could be seen as an upgrade from Sam Darnold, who went 4-9 with Carolina last season. Mayfield is entering his fifth year in the league. The Browns were heavy contenders in 2020 and entered 2021 with big expectations, only to finish with a disappointing 8-9 and miss the playoffs. The Browns, in a major surprise, acquired Deshaun Watson from the Texans for a package including three first round picks. They then gave him an enormous, fully guaranteed contract worth $230 million. There is uncertainty as to whether and how much Watson will be able to play this season. He will not face charges in Texas after being accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 massage therapists, but still might face league discipline under the Personal Conduct Policy. Nonetheless, the ties with Mayfield had been severed. The quarterback felt “disrespected” by the team’s communication amid the Watson acquisition. “Yeah the respect thing is all going to be a personal thing, but yeah, I feel disrespected. 100 percent,” Mayfield said in April. “Because I was told one thing, and they completely did another. That’s what I’m in the middle of now. And you know what? Okay. I got my taste of it, because I’ve had four different head coaches in four years. A bunch of different coordinators.”
