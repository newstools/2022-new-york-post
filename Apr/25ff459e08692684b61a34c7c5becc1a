What is a game show payday for a world-renowned TV doc? Dr. Mehmet Oz took a two-week guest-hosting gig for “Jeopardy!” last year — and it has just been revealed that he was paid a hefty sum to anchor the beloved trivia series from March 22 to April 2, 2021. According to US Senate financial disclosure filings, the 61-year-old was compensated with roughly $269,000 for guest-hosting the game show. The money was donated to an unspecified charity. His economic earnings were disclosed due to him being a probable Republican US Senate candidate in Pennsylvania. Some of his other earnings noted in the papers: his $2 million salary for “The Dr. Oz Show,” and more than $7 million in ownership interest from Oz Media, the Wrap reported. Dr. Oz also raked in about $330,000 in royalties from Columbia University for his role in creating the cardiovascular gadget MitraClip. He announced in November he was running for the seat of retired US Sen. Pat Toomey. “The Dr. Oz Show” came to end following the political move in January. The long-running series was replaced by “The Good Dish,” a one-hour cooking and talk show hosted by his daughter and “MasterChef Junior” judge Daphne Oz, food writer Gail Simmons and Food Network chef Jamika Pessoa. Dr. Oz’s syndicated daytime series won 10 Emmys over the course of its run and aired for 13 seasons beginning in 2009. The Turkish-American doctor caused some controversy last spring following his “Jeopardy!” temp job — one in a series of high-profile guest hosts after the death of Alex Trebek from pancreatic cancer in November 2020 — after reports surfaced that he made fun of contestants. “It was just odd,” winner Emily Seaman told the Ringer of Oz’s stint as emcee at the time. “I don’t think he likes ‘Jeopardy!’ ” Seaman claimed she overheard him making a joke about her when she failed to answer a question. “I heard him making fun of it to one of the producers,” she said. “Like, ‘I can’t believe they didn’t get this one.’ ”
