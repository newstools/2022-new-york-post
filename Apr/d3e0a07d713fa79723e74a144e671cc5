They were only teammates for a short period of time, Dwayne Haskins and Ben Roethlisberger, but the retired quarterback still felt a bond with Haskins. He shared his experience in a touching letter after Haskins, 24, was killed on Saturday in a tragic accident. “He came to work everyday with a smile on his face and energy and love in his heart,” Roethlisberger wrote in the letter he shared on social media. “I really enjoyed his passion and love for the game and wanting to learn and be the best. His smile and zeal for life will be missed! “Wish we had more time together on this earth, but I will cherish the time and the laughs we had! I’ll say it again just like I told you to your face, I still wish I could throw the ball like you!! Love ya pal.” Haskins, a star at Ohio State, spent last season as the Steelers’ third-string quarterback and was in South Florida recently training with Steelers teammates. On Saturday, he was struck and killed by a dump truck while walking on I-595 West outside Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. It’s unclear why Haskins was walking on the highway.
