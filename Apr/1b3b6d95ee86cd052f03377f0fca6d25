A man accused of raping 4-year-old twins in Pennsylvania attacked two officers who tracked him down to a Midtown homeless shelter Tuesday and then escaped, cops said. Suspected fiend Isaiah Metz, 22, was at the Antonio Olivieri Drop-In Center on West 30th Street near Eighth Avenue in Manhattan when an NYPD detective and an investigator from the city Department of Investigation – both part of the Regional Fugitive Task Force – showed up to arrest him about 4:15 a.m., police said. Metz fought the two officers – punching both in the head multiple times and biting the investigator on the arm — before taking off, cops said. Metz was adopted into a foster family in Pennsylvania, where he is accused of raping the twin female tots, police sources said. The heinous sex assaults happened in Goldsboro, located in York County, CBS reported.  He faces a total of 115 charges, including for child-pornography offenses, records show. Metz is also on parole for allegedly attacking a cop, also in Pennsylvania, according to CBS. Cops released a photo of the on-the-lam suspect. Both attacked officers were treated and released at Bellevue Hospital, cops said. Metz is described as having a dark complexion and red hair, standing about 5-foot-8 and weighing around 165 pounds, police said. He was last seen wearing black and red pajama pants and a black hooded sweatshirt.
