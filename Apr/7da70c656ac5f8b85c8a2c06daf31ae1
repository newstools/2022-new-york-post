Business is booming for Brandon Marshall. The Post has learned that “I am Athlete,” the podcast network founded by the former All-Pro NFL wideout, has inked a broad deal with SiriusXM involving both content and other aspects of business. “We are excited to team up with SiriusXM. SiriusXM is an extraordinary company that shares our passion for innovation in storytelling and giving the athlete a platform,” Marshall said in a statement. “’I Am Athlete’ is the premier destination for athletes to tell their own stories, write their own scripts, highlight successes and also hold each other accountable. The sports media landscape has drastically changed. Our partnership brings our unique content and approach to storytelling to fans, every day.” The program “I am Athlete Tonight” will now air on weeknights on SiriusXM Mad Dog Radio, from 7-9 p.m. This show will be hosted by former NFL defensive end Leger Douzable with rotating analysts, including Marshall, former NFL players LeSean McCoy, Brandon Flowers and Adam “Pacman” Jones, former NBA player Antoine Walker, former WNBA player Chantel Tremitiere and writer Omar Kelly. SiriusXM will also take over ad sales for the popular “I am Athlete” podcast hosted by Marshall and Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson and the rest of the shows on the network. “’I Am Athlete’ has established itself as a prominent and popular podcast because it is the kind of authentic, straight-from-the-athlete talk that fans love and want more of.  We’re excited to team up and build on that,” SiriusXM sports boss Steve Cohen said. “Brandon and team will produce new and exclusive content that will enhance our Mad Dog Sports Radio channel. And together, we look forward to developing new talent and content for ‘I Am Athlete’ and SiriusXM that will appeal to listeners everywhere.”
