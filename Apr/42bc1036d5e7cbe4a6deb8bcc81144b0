Bill Murray was spotted for the first time Tuesday since his “inappropriate behavior” allegedly shut down production of Aziz Ansari’s flick “Being Mortal.” The comedic legend and SNL alumnus was nabbed racing through Los Angeles International Airport around 6 a.m. local time, cutting off more than a dozen travelers to get through security to dodge questions about the controversy. “Mr. Murray, how are you sir?” the man filming the brief encounter is heard asking the comic. “Sir, is there anything you can say about the ‘Being Mortal’ set being shut down?” Murray, 71, dressed in black with a blue vest and baseball cap and wearing a black mask, turns his head away as he fled the cameraman. He reaches a line of air travelers waiting to get through security, cuts off more than a dozen people, and reaches the security checkpoint — without answering. The actor has been mum about the halt in the movie’s production earlier this month following a bombshell allegation that he had been “touchy” with women on the set. Filming of “Being Mortal” was suspended indefinitely on April 21 after the claims surfaced. “He was very hands-on touchy, not in any personal areas, but put an arm around a woman, touched her hair, pulled her ponytail — but always in a comedic way,” a source told Page Six last week. “It’s a fine line and everybody loves Bill,” the source said. “But while his conduct is not illegal, some women felt uncomfortable and he crossed the line.”
