A body was discovered inside a burning car in the Bronx early Monday, police said. Police responded to a report of a double-parked car on fire at Intervale Avenue and Kelly Street in the Woodstock neighborhood around 5:30 a.m., authorities said. Once the FDNY extinguished the blaze, an unidentified person was discovered inside, cops said. The vehicle did not appear to have been involved in a collision, police said. It was not immediately clear how the person died, or how the fire started.
