College basketball will have a new champion today, and Action Network analysts Anthony Dabbundo and Charlie DiSturco are here to give their best bets for the game (video above). Kansas enters the championship game as consensus four-and-a-half-point favorites against the North Carolina Tar Heels. For Dabbundo, his early lean is to the Jayhawks. However, he’s looking but is looking to live bet the favorite as opposed to laying the points pre-game. “There’s going to be opportunities to live bet this game with a total this big,” Dabbundo explains. He also cites Kansas’ superior perimeter defense to Duke’s and its ability to successfully defend ball screens as the reasoning behind North Carolina potentially cooling off. Thus, Dabbundo is looking for Kansas at -3 or better. For DiSturco, he’s in agreement that four-and-a-half points is too rich for a national championship game that should be close. Additionally, he believes it will be Kansas that cut down the nets. “UNC is not great at defending the transition, and they’re not great at defending the perimeter,” DiSturco says. “I think those will be two areas Kansas will be able to exploit.” As for the total, both Dabbundo and DiSturco lean toward the under on a fairly high number but would choose to back a live over rather than taking a pre-game position.  “It’s just very hard to get over 153 in a national championship game,” Dabbundo says. “With that being said, it should be a great game.”
