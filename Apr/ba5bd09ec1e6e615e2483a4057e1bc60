Horrifying video captures the moment that dozens of gunshots rang out in the vicinity of a youth baseball game in South Carolina. Monday night, during a Dixie Youth league baseball game at Pepperhill Park in North Charleston, the group of kids on the field can be seen reacting to the sound of shots nearby. At first, the kids were confused, not sure what’s going on. When it dawned on them what is happening, they all ran for cover. ABC News 4, the local news affiliate that distributed video of the incident, reports that one of the team’s coaches lobbied the league to no longer hold games at the park in North Charleston due to the violence in the area. Police told the outlet that no one was injured in the incident. Cops told TMZ that the shooting occurred after a fist fight between a “large group” of teen boys, who fled the scene before officers arrived. The city, which has about 111,000 people, has had 11 homicides so far in 2022 — up from six this time last year. This past weekend, there were two homicides, and one of the victims was a 16-year-old boy.
