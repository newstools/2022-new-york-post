Will Smith resigned from the Academy of Motion Pictures Friday in the face of possible suspension or expulsion from the organization after he slapped Chris Rock during the Oscars last weekend. In a resignation statement, Smith said he would accept any consequences imposed by the Academy’s Board of Governors for his actions. “The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home,” Smith said in the statement, obtained by Variety. “I betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken.” Smith apologized for taking attention away from other award winners, whose accomplishments were overshadowed not only by the so-called slap heard ‘round the world, but his emotional acceptance speech moments later as he accepted the award for Best Actor for his role in “King Richard.” “I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film,” Smith stated. He added, “change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.” An Academy source told The Post Smith’s resignation will not affect its conduct review of the incident.
