A pair of muggers brutally beat a man and struck him with a glass bottle in Bensonhurst this week, disturbing footage shows. The 28-year-old man was walking slowly at 67th Street and 15th Avenue — apparently looking at his phone — around 4:15 a.m. Monday, when one of the men came up behind him and put him in a headlock, knocking him to the ground, the clip shows. Then both of the suspects repeatedly pummeled the man and struck him with a bottle, according to cops and the video. The duo is shown rifling the victim’s pockets before dragging and kicking him into the street, next to a parked car. They took off with the victim’s cellphone and about $100, fleeing on 67th Street toward 14th Avenue, cops said. The victim was taken to Maimonides Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition.
