Paulina Gretzky and Dustin Johnson’s Tennessee wedding over the weekend included a special appearance by Kid Rock. In a video posted Sunday to Gretzky’s Instagram Story, the newlyweds are seen dancing together as Kid Rock appears to sing a rendition of Chris Stapleton’s “Joy of My Life.” “You Are The Joy of My Life @djohnsonpga,” Gretzky, 33, captioned the clip. “Thank you @kidrock.” Johnson, 37, who announced his engagement to Gretzky in 2013, is seen smiling in the video beside his new bride, who seemingly gave a glimpse of her reception dress. The longtime couple swapped vows at the luxurious Blackberry Farm resort on Saturday, with bride Gretzky reportedly wearing a Vera Wang wedding dress. Leading up to the highly anticipated nuptials, Gretzky and Johnson spent time with friends and family at the five-star resort, including sons Tatum, 7, and River, 4. Although Gretzky nor Johnson has yet to post an official portrait from their big day on social media, guests have shared images and videos from the lavish affair on their pages. Paige DeSorbo, the star of Bravo’s hit series “Summer House,” posted a glamorous photo from inside the venue, where she was joined by boyfriend Craig Conover of “Southern Charm.” “The royal wedding,” DeSorbo captioned one post. Sara Gretzky, who is married to the bride’s brother Ty, also shared images of the couple posing by a “No Regretzkys” backdrop. Pal Jeremy Cohen also posted a black-and-white snap with the bride and groom. It’s been a whirlwind few months for Johnson and Gretzky, who had an epic bachelorette party in St. Barths earlier this year. In the weeks leading up to their wedding day, Johnson also competed in the 2022 Masters at Augusta National. Johnson, the 2020 champion, finished the tournament tied for 12th.
