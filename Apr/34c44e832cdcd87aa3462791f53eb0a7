Will Smith’s afternoon at the ballpark included a downpour of boos — and a slap hit to the outfield. The Dodgers catcher, who happens to share a name with a certain Academy Award winner now at the center of a 2022 Oscars scandal, was greeted Thursday with jeers from the crowd during LA’s spring training game against the Texas Rangers in Arizona. Upon making his way to the plate, the 27-year-old then hit the ball into deep center field for a triple. Unfortunately for Smith, his Dodgers lost to the Rangers, 8-2. Thursday’s game comes days after actor Will Smith slapped Oscars presenter Chris Rock on stage at Sunday’s Academy Awards. The comedian, 57, had been presenting the award for Best Documentary and made a joke about the bald head of Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who suffers from alopecia and has been open about her hair loss struggles. “Keep my wife’s name out of your f—king mouth,” Smith, 53, screamed inside the Dolby Theatre. In the moments following the incident, Smith received the Best Actor award for his work as Richard Williams, the father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena, in the film “King Richard.” The Academy has since condemned Smith’s actions, with conflicting reports emerging about whether or not the actor was asked to leave the ceremony. Smith apologized publicly to Rock on Monday.
