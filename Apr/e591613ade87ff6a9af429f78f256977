Dr. Mehmet Oz personally bought thousands of dollars worth of hydroxychloroquine during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2020, Oz spent $8,800.00 on 2070 tablets of the drug. The purchase came at a time when the TV doctor was heavily promoting the anti-Malaria drug as a possible treatment for the deadly virus. His advocacy even reached the White House which confirmed Trump was taking the drug in May of that year. Oz’s campaign confirmed the purchase and said the doctor had been trying to help Columbia University with a study. “At the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Mehmet Oz spoke with health experts worldwide who were seeing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as viable treatment options for desperately ill COVID patients. He offered to fund the clinical trial at Columbia University,” Brittany Yanick, Oz’s Communications Director told The Post. The campaign said Oz had been prepared to spend $250,000 to assist the school, but that the offer was rejected and Oz ended up donating the pills to a hospital which he refused to name. Multiple studies have since shown that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for those suffering from coronavirus and the Worlds Health Organization does not recommend its use for prevention.
