Here is a home that takes you into the future. Considered one of the most distinctive properties in the world, a smart home that has no walls has hit the market for $6.88 million. Situated on the charming coastline of Vouliagmeni, Greece, and known as the “Butterfly House” for its unique shape has been pegged as a “one-of-a-kind” home. When seen from above, the five-bedroom, four-bathroom estate looks exactly like the shape of the insect, with wings and oval-shaped holes in the ceiling to emulate a butterfly’s unique patterns. “It is inspired by the shape of the butterfly so as to ensure shading and complete privacy at the same time,” the listing notes. Spanning over 5,300 square feet extending three levels, the main level of the home features an open-floor plan concept and has no walls. There is an elevator that takes you from floor-to-floor. Designed in pristine all-white, the architecture is accented by nature and greenery throughout, including the entrance staircase to offer optimal privacy. Located in the upscale neighborhood of Kavouri, it is just a few steps away from the beach. The ground floor features the living and dining areas with direct access to the pool and outdoor space. It also has an open-concept kitchen and one ensuite bedroom. Below the ground floor is the lower level which comes with a home theater and three bedrooms with three additional bathrooms, which does have some walls. Upstairs level features the primary bedroom with a walk-in closet and a verdan veranda that provides a jacuzzi. Other features include a maids room, laundry room and four closed parking spaces. The home is still currently in construction and is expected to be fully completed by the end of the year. Elena Triantafyllidou with JK Property & Yachting holds the listing.
