“It’s disappointing that Albany chose to lift the cap on casinos, but not charter schools,” Success Academy CEO Eva Moskowitz noted of the new state budget. Spot-on. It couldn’t be clearer. Gov. Kathy Hochul, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate chief Andrea Stewart-Cousins care about special interests and the prospect of big tax revenues, not kids. Charter schools are the best educational option for countless families. New York City desperately needs more charters — but the demand comes mainly from non-white, less affluent parents whose children get shafted by the public-school system. Yet our equity-loving lawmakers still refused to lift the charter cap, even a little, because the politically potent teachers unions hate these alternative public schools that give kids a way to escape the schools the unions dominate. But the gaming industry got the legislative love. Dazzled by the prospect of tax revenue skimmed off casinos, and willfully ignoring gambling’s collateral social damage, New York’s leaders OK’d not one but three new casinos. Could Albany’s priorities be any more perverse?
