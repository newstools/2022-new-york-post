Stephen A. Smith got tricked by a parody account — again — and Kevin Durant laughed at him for it. On Monday’s episode of “First Take”, Smith cited reports as saying that things with James Harden and the Nets reached a breaking point when Kyrie Irving called him washed up. This “scoop” came from the parody account Ballsack Sports, and Smith had already incorrectly cited the same “report” in early March. “Damn steve,” Durant responded to a clip of the ESPN host falling for the fake report. “Got ya ass.” Durant and Smith have a long, testy history with each other, dating back to 2015 when Durant was on the Thunder and accused Smith of lying about linking him to the Lakers. Smith responded by threatening Durant that “you don’t want to make an enemy out of me.” The two have had several frosty interactions since then. In fairness to Smith, the Ballsack Sports account has hoodwinked numerous on-air personalities and outlets into citing its fake news as real. The proprietor of the account, a 24-year-old from Ohio named Matt who has not publicized his last name, told the website Awful Announcing in February that “I wanted to start Ballsack Sports because I wanted to rile up as many people as possible under the most obscenely obvious satirical name. I thought I could do it. And so, I just kind of started making satirical quotes.” “I want to be very transparent that we are not legitimate,” he said. “I don’t know if that isn’t clear.”
