The man suspected of fatally stabbing a rival at a Chinatown gambling den was identified by police on Wednesday night. Shin Bin Weng, 55 was named a suspect in the death of Qi Rui Weng, 58, who died Monday after he was stabbed with a large kitchen knife following a feud inside the social club on Division Street near Orchard Street, according to the NYPD. Police said the two are not related. The suspect had fetched two knives from a neighboring kitchen supply store before returning to the gambling den through a door that connects the two buildings, sources have said. In surveillance footage released by the police Wednesday, the suspect was seen walking through the store wielding one of the blades. The victim was discovered in a restroom with a large knife still embedded in his torso, and a smaller knife by his chair, according to the sources. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital by EMS but could not be saved, police said.
