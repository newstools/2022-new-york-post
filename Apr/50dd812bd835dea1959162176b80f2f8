One TikTok user has revealed her secret iPhone trick to making images and videos look instantly more vibrant. The woman, named Hannah Ludwig, broke down her iPhone editing routine for her 20,000 followers on TikTok. Hannah shared the content in a 43-second long reel that was captioned with several ‘photo’ hashtags. She began the video by displaying an image of a woman in a bikini under the text “iPhone photo hack part 2”. The content creator then adjusted the ‘exposure’ on the image using iPhone’s internal photo app settings. She raised the ‘exposure’ level to 100, then moved on to ‘brilliance’, which she also lifted to 100. Next up was ‘highlights’, which she adjusted to -35. Hannah then touched on the image’s ‘shadows’, lowering that amount to -31. The TikToker headed to the ‘contrast’ setting and adjusted that to -33. She also decreased the ‘brightness’ of the photo to -15. The self-proclaimed photo-editor then went into ‘black point’, which pinpoints the areas of an image that are maximum black, and adjusted that to 11. She intensified the colors in the image as well, by raising ‘saturation’ to 11. Hannah then added some final edits, including adjusting ‘vibrance’ to 9, lifting ‘warmth’ to 11, and adding ‘tint’ at level 46. Then, in a surprise turn of events, she lowered exposure and brilliance back to zero. The end result was a colorful, vibrant, and highly contrasted image. Since going live, the popular TikTok video has raked more than 420,000 likes. Hundreds of TikTok users also left comments under the post. “This hack is amazing!!!! Just tried it out and my pictures look great!! Thank you for sharing,” one user wrote. “She really said trust the process, it looks pretty!” a second user added.
