Fans of Madonna were left puzzled and concerned following the pop icon’s latest TikTok. The 63-year-old posted a 13-second clip just before the 2022 Grammy Awards on Sunday showing the “Material Girl” musician wearing heavy silver chains and a black sheer top with her blond hair in four braids. Her post featured a close-up of her face and large pink pouty lips. The video just showed her leaning back and forth to the camera. Her confused followers couldn’t help but comment on her bizarre TikTok, with many questioning why the Queen of Pop would post such a random thing. Someone wrote that the clip was “completely unsettling.” Another commented, “Great! How am I supposed to close my eyes and fall asleep now!?” “This honestly scared me I’m not gonna lie,” one fan chimed in. “I’m just going to remember how fabulous she was in the 90s. She was an icon,” a user said. Another fan noted, “I’ve loved Madonna since I was little … huge fan… love her … but this is a hard pass… what has she done to herself?” The “Evita” star has recently been sharing NSFW photos via social media and many followers have speculated that her snaps are heavily edited and Photoshopped. Rap superstar 50 Cent even gave his two cents, and slammed her for a recent lingerie photo shoot she shared in January. “Yo this is the funniest s—t LOL,” the “In da Club” singer, 46, wrote on his Instagram Story at the time. “That’s Madonna under the bed trying to do like a virgin at 63. She shot out, if she don’t get her old a-s up.” Madonna then clapped back and blasted the “Power” producer, accusing him of “pretending” to be her “friend.” “Now you have decided to talk smack about me. I guess your new career is getting attention by trying to humiliate others on social media. The least elevated choice you could make as an artist and an adult,” she penned at the time.
