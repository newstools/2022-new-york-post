The undoubtedly safe route is to back Kansas against North Carolina in the men’s NCCA Tournament final, as the 4.5-point spread is spot on. However, the line opening at more than a one-possession margin is telling of the gap between these two teams. Kansas enters this matchup coming off one of its most efficient performances of the season against Villanova. The Jayhawks shot 53 percent from the field and were lights out from beyond the arc, shooting 13 of 24 from deep against the Wildcats in the Final Four. Jayhawks star guard Ochai Agbaji was a big part of that sharpshooting display in the semifinals — he was on fire early by making his first six shots, which were all from 3-point range. Agbaji’s shooting performance is a scary sight for the Tar Heel faithful, as North Carolina is 182nd in 3-point percentage allowed. That weakness in North Carolina’s defense could be compounded on Monday night as Kansas has plenty of other shooters who will get in on the act. We saw Christian Braun, Dajuan Harris Jr. and Jalen Wilson all knockdown multiple 3s. Remy Martin can’t be forgotten about, as well. The Jayhawks match up well against the Tar Heels’ primary scorers on the other end of the floor. Tar Heels star big man Armando Bacot will be forced to battle with David McCormack all game long inside, and UNC’s outside shooting will be limited. Kansas is 25th in 3-point percentage allowed and will throw the length of Agbaji and Wilson on the likes of Caleb Love and Brady Manek. Back Kansas to cut down the nets in New Orleans.
