Four intruders held two men at gunpoint and stole $200,000 from their Brooklyn apartment this week, cops said. The victims, 41 and 32, were inside their apartment at East 21st Street and Church Avenue in Flatbush around 5:25 p.m. Sunday when two of the crooks barged in through the unlocked door and displayed guns, police said late Tuesday. The two other suspects then entered and started pilfering some cash, cops said. Then the suspects held the two residents at gunpoint and demanded that they open two safes that held even more dough, police said. They grabbed $200,000 in total, cops said. The thieves allegedly restrained the victims with tape before fleeing north on East 21st Street. The victims did not require medical attention on scene, police said. Authorities did not know whether they were specifically targeted or whether they knew the intruders. Police are still searching for the suspects.
