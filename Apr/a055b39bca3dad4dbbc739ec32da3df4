“Harry Potter” actress Miriam Margolyes is defending J.K. Rowling, insisting anger over her trans comments is “misplaced” — and offering to broker peace talks with the younger stars who have denounced her. The 80-year-old actress, who played Professor Sprout in the wizardly series, stood up for the bestselling author, who has faced death threats and calls to be canceled over her remarks. “There isn’t one answer to all these trans questions,” Margolyes told the UK’s Radio Times magazine, according to Yahoo News. “We all know people who are slightly pansy or a bit butch or whatever you call it,” the actress said, saying that “there is a spectrum and people can be anywhere along that.” “But I think the vituperation J.K. Rowling has received is misplaced,” she said of the vitriol directed at the author. “I admire her as a human being. She’s a generous woman, she’s a brilliant writer,” the actress said of Rowling, saying that if people were kinder to others, “a lot of the misery would disappear.” She also said she would mediate talks between Rowling and the Potter stars who have denounced her comments, including leading actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. “I would if anybody asked me,” she said. Rowling’s cancel-culture backlash started in June 2020 when she sarcastically responded to an article about “Creating a more equal post-COVID-19 world for people who menstruate.” “’People who menstruate,'” she tweeted snarkily. “I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?” Margolyes’ co-star Robbie Coltrane, who played Hagrid, was initially a lone voice from the franchise defending Rowling. “I don’t think what she said was offensive really,” Coltrane had also told Radio Times, in September 2020. “I don’t know why but there’s a whole Twitter generation of people who hang around waiting to be offended,” he said, admitting he sounded “like a grumpy old man.”
