If we’re being honest, we’re jealous of those attending the 2022 Grammys — not just because of the hot-button exorbitance characteristic of the Red Carpet, but for the gift bags. That’s right — I mean, what else would you expect us, the New York Post Shopping team, to gloss over? The yearly gift bag, layered like a tiramisu with the best luxury gifts, is a treat in and of itself. This Sunday, April 3, attending celebrities like Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X (all of whom will be performing) will receive a goody bag that’s better than any gift basket you’ve ever seen. Truth be told, we’ve been all over TikTok and social platforms to compile the official list of what will be given in those wishful-thinking Grammys gift bags. Stocked with items from brands like Pixi Beauty, Rose Box NYC and Philips One. Though the Grammys won’t be nearly as action-packed as the infamous slap-ridden Oscars, this one’s surely worth the watch (and the shopping, ahead and during the live show). You don’t need a VIP pass to access these products. See below for our top selects you can click, shop and enjoy. Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
