A brazen crew carjacked a man in the Bronx — one of them stomping on his car and another pummeling him in the face, wild new video shows. The 53-year-old victim, driving a Kia van, got into a smash-up with a Lexus SUV as both drivers headed north on Exterior Street in the Concourse neighborhood around 6:40 p.m. on March 30, cops said Wednesday. The impact sent the drivers careening into a parked, unoccupied Honda sedan, cops said. Then a group of six men — the 23-year-old Lexus driver, later identified as Miquiel Guerrero, and five others — surrounded the victim’s car, according to cops and the footage. One of the men climbed on top of the van, Guerrero repeatedly punched the driver in the face, and the rest of the group stood close by, according to police and the video. Once the victim ran off, two of the men got into the van and fled north on Exterior Street. Three of the men took off in the Honda sedan. Guerrero stayed on scene, where he was taken into custody and later charged with robbery. The victim was taken to Jacobi Medical Center for a fractured eye socket and cuts on his face, cops said. Police are still looking for the rest of the group, all described as between 18 and 25 years old.
