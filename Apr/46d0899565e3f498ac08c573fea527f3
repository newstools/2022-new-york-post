Billie Eilish just turned into a full-fledged rock star. The typically low-key singer-songwriter slayed the live stage like never before while performing her heart-shattering hit “Happier Than Ever” at Grammys 2022. The namesake track off her 2021 album seemed to break Eilish free of her previously soft sound with its thundering hard rock bridge at Sunday’s Grammys telecast from Las Vegas. The 20-year-old pop superstar — fittingly clad in a black tribute T-shirt bearing the visage of the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins — started the tune with the first soft verses as she wandered through a prop upside down house flooded with water. Then, transitioning into the iconic bridge, the rain came down. The lyrics, detailing the anger and resentment felt after a breakup, paired with the electric rock sound to deliver a sort of musical middle finger. Follow the 2022 Grammys with our up-to-the-minute coverage:  Thrashing in the downpour — an impressive rain-shower special effect — she sang her heart out, letting her heartbreak flood the stage. Eilish, who already has seven Grammys, is nominated for another seven this year including Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Song of the Year. In 2020, she was famously caught on camera pleading “please don’t be me” after she racked up her first five Grammys.
