Step aside, Bennifer. Jack White got engaged, then married onstage during his Detroit concert Friday night. The Detroit News reports White, 46, called his girlfriend, singer Olivia Jean, on stage for a duet of White Stripes’ “Hotel Yorba” in front of a sold-out crowd at Masonic Temple. White then popped the question to a surprised Jean and put a ring on it, before asking the crowd “it’s been such a great day, mind if we get married right now?” White, indeed, had an action-packed day. He released his solo album “Fear of the Dawn” and also performed the national anthem at the Detroit Tigers season opener. Both White and Jean grew up in The Motor City. The “Taking Me Back” singer’s bandmates, parents, and officiant, Third Man Record’s co-founder Ben Swank, gathered on stage to make it official, WXYZ reports. “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life,” Swank reportedly said, quoting Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy.” White does not allow cell phones at his shows, so fans were not able to capture the nuptials. This is White’s third marriage. He and his White Stripes bandmate Meg White were married from 1996 to 2000. He then married model and singer Karen Elson in 2005, but they divorced in 2013. White returns to the Masonic Temple for another concert on Saturday,
