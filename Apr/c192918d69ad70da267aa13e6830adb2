Six reputed mobsters who allegedly served in various roles in the Genovese crime family were charged in a racketeering conspiracy in Manhattan federal court Tuesday. The six alleged wiseguys — including two caporegimes — raked in money for the syndicate from 2011 to 2022 “through a pattern of racketeering activity,” which included extortion and illegal gambling, according to the indictment against them. The suspects were “members and associates of an organized criminal enterprise known as the Genovese Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, whose members and associates engaged in crimes including making extortionate extensions of credit,” the indictment states. The alleged mobsters charged include capos Nicholas Calisi and Ralph Balsamo, soldiers Michael Messina and John Campanella and associates Michael Poli and Thomas Poli, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York said. Four of the alleged gangsters are expected to make a first appearance in Manhattan federal court later Tuesday. All of the six suspects face a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted. “From extortion to illegal gambling, the Mafia continues to find ways to prey on others to fill its coffers. Our office and our law enforcement partners remain committed to putting organized crime out of business,” US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement after the indictment was unsealed. Attorneys for Messina, Michael Poli, Campanella and Balsamo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attorney information for Thomas Poli and Calisi was not immediately available.
