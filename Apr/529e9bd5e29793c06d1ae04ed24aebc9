Though you might have your eyes set on Apple’s latest products, your wallet may be saying otherwise. If you’d like to enjoy all the bells and whistles that an Apple MacBook includes without paying nearly a month’s rent, it’s time to think about refurbished models. A refurbished product like this Apple MacBook Air 13.3″ provides all of the perks at a fraction of the price — 75% off, in fact — and right now you can snag the Mac laptop and an accessories bundle for just $295.99 instead of the usual $1,199 price tag. This Apple MacBook Air 13,3″ includes a 22-nm “Haswell” 1.4 GHz Intel “Core i5” processor, which helps you run through your daily to-do list efficiently, thanks to its enhancing processing power. The Intel HD Graphics 5000 graphics processor ensures you are seeing high-quality images while you get your duties done… and streaming your favorite shows or gaming smoothly when the work is over and it’s time for play. 128GB of storage is yours to safeguard all your important items like photos, videos and documents, and Bluetooth 4.0 lets you easily connect and use your wireless devices as needed. WiFi connectivity lets you log on from anywhere, and a twelve-hour battery ensures you can get your 9-5 done on-the-go without having to stay tethered to an outlet. This particular model hails from 2014 and scored a “B” rating, which means you might see light scuffing on the bevel or case or light scratches or dents on the compact, sleek body. You’ll also receive a black case to keep your MacBook Air safe and an AC charger for powering back up when you need some juice.
