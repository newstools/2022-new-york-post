A bizarre optical illusion of a bride and groom celebrating their wedding day has left people baffled. The image showing a husband hoisting his wife into the air looks askew — but can you work out what’s going on? At first glance it appears that the bride’s legs are over her husbands’ shoulders as the duo celebrate their special day. But upon realising that her limbs are out of proportion, it was revealed that the back of the groom’s jacket blended in with the colours of his wife’s dress. So what initially appeared to be her legs, were actually the his arms, according to Bored Panda. Confused users in the comments were stunned by the discovery as they exchanged their thoughts of the same photo. “I can’t not see her legs over his shoulders,” one user said as another added: “And when you see it, you can’t unsee it.” A third user added: “I needed way to long time to see that her legs are his arms.” While a fourth replied:” Either way this is a beautiful pic! They look incredibly happy!” Earlier this month, another image went viral for the all wrong reasons after it appeared to show six women sitting on a sofa — despite there only being five pairs of legs on display. In the image, the four women are sitting cross-legged but it seems that the third female from the left is missing her legs. The woman in question is leaning. This means the legs to the right belong to her, according to Insider. The second female from the left is wearing black pants and her legs are hidden. They are being obscured by the woman who is sitting on the far left. As we’ve seen in other recent optical illusions, the camera can be very deceptive. For example, there’s a mind-bending video which appears to show a corgi being thrown out of a plane in mid-air. Plus, a mind-bending optical illusion appears to show a stunning view of Earth from the depths of space — but not all is as it seems.
