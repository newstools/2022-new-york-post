Taylor Swift could have been talking about this skittering insect when she wrote “Shake it Off.“ A millipede commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains was recently renamed for her as a tribute to the pop star. The so-dubbed Nannaria swiftae is one of 17 new species of millipede discovered in the region and is vital for decomposition and nutrients spread in wooded ecosystems. “Her music helped me get through the highs and lows of graduate school, so naming a new millipede species after her is my way of saying thanks,” said Virginia Tech entomologist Derek Hennen in a statement. The Post has reached out to Swift’s publicist for comment. They tend to hide just below the soil surface where they can munch undisturbed on decaying leaves and plant matter. Their stealth existence is part of the reason they were so difficult to analyze, researchers said. A multi-year project to collect and record unidentified specimens was launched across 17 states throughout the Eastern US, during which Hennen and fellow scientists Jackson Means and Paul Mare groped at the forest floor to peep under rocks, leaves and logs in search of hiding millipedes. They found more than 1,800 critters, including some already found in university and museum collections, with 17 new species described in their report published in the open-access journal ZooKeys. The new set of Nannaria millipedes measure 18 and 38 millimeters long and have a brown to black trunk with white, red or orange spots and white legs. Male Nannaria millipedes are characterized by having “twisted” claws at the ends of their front legs.
