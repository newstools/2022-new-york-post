Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen who beat homicide charges after killing two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wis., in the summer of 2020, has slammed President Biden for turning a “blind eye” to his son Hunter’s business dealings. “Let me get this straight, Joe Biden can turn a blind eye to the misconduct of his own son, but defames me for defending myself?!” the 19-year-old tweeted Tuesday. “The more I read, the more I shake my head.” Rittenhouse’s comments come off the back of a trail of negative media coverage scrutinizing Hunter Biden’s dealings and alleged misconduct — including reports by the Washington Post and New York Times that belatedly verified emails from the infamous laptop first reported on by The Post in 2020. The first son also recently paid a tax bill of more than $1 million to avoid prosecution, according to the Times. The back taxes applied to a financial windfall Hunter Biden reaped from countries when his father was vice president. Rittenhouse has previously vowed to sue President Biden for referring to him as a white supremacist after his arrest over the shootings that killed two men and wounded a third on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha. After Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges following his trial last November, the teen voiced plans to file lawsuits against liberal media outlets and other high-profile personalities, including LeBron James and Whoopi Goldberg, for spreading “lies” about him. Rittenhouse said last week that he has repeatedly reached out to Biden for a sit-down meeting — but claims he’s been ignored. “I reached out to Joe Biden several times — crickets, nothing,” Rittenhouse told “The Jenna Ellis Show” podcast. “He still hasn’t replied. So it just shows how much of a man he is to not sit down and talk.”
