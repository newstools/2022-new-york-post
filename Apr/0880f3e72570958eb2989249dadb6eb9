Three students were injured Friday after a knife fight broke out in the parking lot of a high school in New York’s northern suburbs, officials said. An argument broke out at Rockland County’s Spring Valley High School at 2:10 p.m. as kids were dismissed for the weekend leading to two students getting slashed and a third punched in the face, school officials and reports said. An “individual” is in custody, the East Ramapo Central School District said in a statement. News 12 Hudson Valley said the person taken into custody was 19 years old and had the most severe injuries while the three others involved in the fight were all under 17. All four were male teenagers, the station reported. A student resource officer and security broke up the fight, school officials said. Two students suffered “lacerations from a knife” and a third had “minor abrasions to the face,” the district said, but didn’t elaborate. ABC 7 reported that one of the people wounded by the knife was stabbed, while the other may have been wounded during a struggle. The student with the most severe injury was in stable condition at Westchester Medical Center in neighboring Westchester County, the district said. The other two hurt were being treated at hospitals in Rockland County. “While this incident is serious, the safety and well-being of our students is of primary importance,” the district said in a statement. “The East Ramapo Central School District has a zero-tolerance policy regarding violence in any of our school buildings or campuses.” Spring Valley police confirmed a stabbing but told The Post the details were still under investigation.
