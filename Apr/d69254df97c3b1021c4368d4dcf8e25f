There’s a new Kennedy in town! Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, is celebrating after the birth of her first grandchild, The Post can reveal. Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg — Caroline’s daughter with designer Edwin Schlossberg — was spotted Thursday carrying her newborn in Manhattan. Tatiana, 31, wed her Yale sweetheart Dr. George Moran, 32, in September 2017. The ceremony was held in the garden of her late grandmother Jackie’s summer home on Martha’s Vineyard. Tatiana is the middle of three children: Her sister Rose, 33, is a filmmaker, and brother Jack, 29, recently graduated from Harvard Law and Harvard Business School. Caroline, meanwhile, is set to become the US Ambassador to Australia. While her brother is already being touted as a Democrat hopeful, Tatiana has laughed off any idea of going into politics. While promoting her book “Inconspicuous Consumption” in 2019, she told Vogue, “Politics can be a noble profession, and it has been in the past. I respect all the people who go into politics and make change and do what is right. I don’t think that’s my particular way of contributing. I do come from a family of politicians, but I also come from a family of writers: my mom and my dad are writers.” Moran, who graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons in 2018, specializes in general surgery and urology. Like his wife, he comes from an impressive family. His mother, Mary Penniman Moran, is the treasurer of the board of Natural Resources Defense Council, and his father Garrett Moran is the former president of the non profit Year Up. Garrett was formerly the chief operating officer of the private equity group Blackstone. Asked about the news, Moran’s dad said “no comment.” Reps for Kennedy were unavailable.
