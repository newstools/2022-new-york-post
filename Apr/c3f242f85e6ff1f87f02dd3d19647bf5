When it comes to valuations of sports teams, the New York Yankees are king of the hill and top of the heap. The Bronx Bombers are worth $7.01 billion — beating out the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys for the title of most valuable franchise. The Cowboys are the second most valuable team with a valuation of $6.92 billion, according to the news site Sportico, which factored in metrics such as revenue, real estate, and related businesses. The NBA’s New York Knicks ($6.12 billion) and the Golden State Warriors ($6.03 billion) are the only other sports franchises whose valuations are north of $6 billion. The rankings were done based on figures from 2019 — the last full season that was played before the pandemic. According to Sportico, the Yankees generated $700 million in revenue in 2019 — the highest in all of Major League Baseball. The Yankees also generate an additional $300 million in cash flow every year from its ownership of YES, the regional sports network that broadcasts Yankees and Brooklyn Nets games. The Yanks’ fierce rival, the Boston Red Sox, are worth $5.07 billion. The Sox are baseball’s second most valuable team. Collectively, baseball’s 30 teams are worth $69 billion. The average value of an MLB franchise — which includes the team and related businesses like stadiums and regional sports networks — is $2.31 billion. The New York Mets were purchased by billionaire Steve Cohen in 2020 for $2.42 billion. Forbes valued the Mets at $2.65 billion.
