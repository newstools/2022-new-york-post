Amazon pays summer interns more than three times as much as some warehouse and delivery workers, according to data published Tuesday. The median corporate intern at Amazon — which offers internships throughout the year — rakes in $8,000 a month, according to a new report from corporate review site Glassdoor. That’s the equivalent of $96,000 per year or $46.15 per hour based on a 40-hour work week. By comparison, Amazon’s warehouse and delivery workers make a minimum of $15 an hour and the company says its median starting wage for warehouse workers stands at $18 an hour. The data on intern pay comes on the heels of Amazon warehouse workers in New York becoming the company’s first-ever US employees to unionize. The Amazon Labor Union, which is representing thousands of workers at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, is pushing for Amazon to increase its company-wide minimum wage to $30. While that’s double Amazon’s current minimum pay, it’s still just 65% of the company’s reported median intern pay. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon’s internship program is the fifth-highest-paying in the US, according to Glassdoor’s report. Online gaming company Roblox takes the number-one spot with median monthly intern pay of $9,667 — the equivalent of $116,000 per year — followed by Uber and Capital One at $8,333 each and Salesforce at $8,167. Amazon, Meta and Nvidia all have median monthly intern salaries of $8,000, followed by LinkedIn, Expedia and HubSpot at $7,500 each. Among other big tech firms, Microsoft pays $7,366 per month, followed by Apple at $7,000 and Google at a paltry $6,454, according to the report. Investment bank Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, doesn’t even rank in the top 25 highest-paying internships. The company is beaten by JPMorgan, Citi, Deutsche Bank and several other competitors, according to Glassdoor. Glassdoor said it based the rankings on more than 88,000 self-submitted pay reports from current and former interns from February 2021 to February 2022.
