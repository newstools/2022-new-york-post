A young London man who butchered his best friend in front of his family has been sentenced to prison for the horrifying crime. Romello Harley, 19, was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years behind bars Monday for the murder of Tashawn Watt, also 19. Harley was convicted of murder and possession of a bladed weapon last month. On June 25, 2021, a heated argument broke out between Harley and Watt’s brother, Kashawn, at the Watts’ home in Sydenham, London. After Watt was punched in the face, the two brothers called for their mom to ask Harley to leave, police said. Surveillance footage captured Harley returning to the property with “apparent determination” just 15 minutes later, armed with a knife. He lured Watt outside and stabbed him to death as his family watched in horror, according to police. During the trial, Watt’s heartbroken mother, Denise Campbell, called her late son — known in the family as “Tata” — a “calm, kind character” who “would walk away from any confrontation.” “My last memory of Tata was him dying on the floor in front of me,” the anguished mom added. Speaking about Harley, Watt’s mother said, “We showed Romello nothing but kindness and allowed him into our home as though he was one of our family members. I sometimes have questions which I know will never be answered.”
