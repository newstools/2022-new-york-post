Shocking video footage shows the moment a Queens pawn shop owner was beaten so badly with a metal rod that cops initially thought he’d been shot in the head. The clip, released by the NYPD early Friday, shows the 60-year-old owner of Global Pawn Shop in Jamaica on the floor desperately trying to raise his arms to stop the constant flurry of blows Monday afternoon. His black-clad attacker — seen more clearly in images also released Friday — instead repeatedly pushed the helpless victim back down on the floor to continue the bloody assault. The beating was so savage that responding officers initially assumed he’d been shot in the head, only learning it was blunt force trauma once he was at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. The victim is still in critical condition, according to cops, who said they still do not have a motive for the attack. The 10-second clip was released Friday alongside a series of clearer images of the suspect still being sought for the brutal beating. While he was originally seen in a dark blue jacket with a hood, face mask and green Adidas baseball cap, newer images clearly show the dark-haired suspect’s face as he walks in earmuffs and sunglasses. The suspect is described as roughly 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, with a medium build and medium complexion. He was last seen fleeing westbound on Jamaica Avenue, the NYPD said.
