Clayton Kershaw was perfect through seven innings. And then Dave Roberts took him out. The Dodgers manager would not let Kershaw go beyond the 80 pitches he threw Wednesday afternoon in Minneapolis during his first start of the season. “Every decision I make is for the best interest of the player, their health and the ballclub, because there’s a lot of people that are cheering for the Dodgers, not only just for today and Clayton to throw a no-hitter, but for the Dodgers to win the World Series,” Roberts said. “For us to do that, we need him healthy.” The 34-year-old Dodgers southpaw completely shut down the first 21 Twins who came to bat, striking out 13. Alex Vesia came in to pitch the eighth inning with the Dodgers up 6-0. After getting Jorge Polanco out, Vesia gave up a single to former Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez to end the perfect game and no-hit bid. The Dodgers went on to win 7-0. “Those are individual things. Those are selfish goals. We’re trying to win. That’s really all we’re here for,” Kershaw, who had an arm injury last season, told reporters after the game. “As much as I would’ve wanted to do it, I’ve thrown 75 pitches in a sim game on six innings, let alone seven. Sure, I would’ve loved to have do it, but maybe we get another chance, who knows?” The three-time Cy Young winner previously threw a no-hitter on June 18, 2014. Felix Hernandez was the last pitcher to throw a perfect game, doing so for the Mariners on Aug. 15, 2012 against the Rays. Kershaw, an eight-time All-Star, reached free agency for the first time during the offseason but returned to the Dodgers on a one-year, $17 million contract. Roberts pulled Rich Hill from a perfect game after seven innings in 2016 due to blister concerns.
