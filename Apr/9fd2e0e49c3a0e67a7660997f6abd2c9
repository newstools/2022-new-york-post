What’s going on here? A viral video appearing to star O.J. Simpson shows the former NFL running back shirtless in bed while being woken up by a bunch of women. “Let’s wake up OJ at 1am,” is written in red text over the clip. Someone in the background can be heard yelling, “Let’s go! It’s party time in the house!” — while a number of young women congregate in a kitchen, laughing on their phones. Simpson can be seen sitting on the edge of the bed in a pair of dark shorts and white socks, as a blonde nearby yelled, “Wakey wakey!” The video was posted to the TikTok of Andrew Silverman, the president of Icon Auction and Events. It’s unclear where the group hangout took place, as well as the original author of the viral video. Simpson has yet to address the video.
