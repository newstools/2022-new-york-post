Don’t mess with Kevin Durant’s mom. Wanda Durant had a bone to pick with a referee in Brooklyn’s 114-107 loss to the Celtics on Wednesday, when her son struggled in Brooklyn’s second straight loss of the first-round playoff series. NBC cameras captured her standing up from her courtside seat at TD Garden in Boston to give referee Jacyn Goble a verbal lashing. It’s unclear what was said during the heated moment, and Goble did not turn around to acknowledge it. She was seated next to her son’s manager, Rich Kleiman. Her reaction came as no surprise to fans who are well aware of Wanda’s passion for the game and supporting her son. After he won the 2014 NBA MVP award, Durant referred to his mother as “the real MVP” in his acceptance speech. Durant, meanwhile, has struggled in the first two games of the Eastern Conference playoff series. During Wednesday’s Game 2, the Celtics shut down the Nets forward with double-team efforts that held him to 4-of-17 shooting, including 0-for-10 in the second half. Turnovers also contributed to Brooklyn’s collapse, including six by Durant. He finished the game with 27 points, going 18-of-20 on free throws, to go with five assists and four rebounds. “It’s on me to just finish it and figure it out,” Durant said after Game 2. “I’m not expecting my teammates or the defense to give me anything. I just got to go out there and play.” Durant’s uncharacteristic performance came after he went 9-of-24 shooting with six turnovers in a 115-114 Game 1 loss to the Celtics on Sunday. The series shifts to Brooklyn for Game 3 on Saturday night.
