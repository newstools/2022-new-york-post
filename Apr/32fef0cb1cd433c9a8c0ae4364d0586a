Police opened fire on a Porsche on the Belt Parkway Sunday morning as it sped toward cops following a suspected theft in Brooklyn, an NYPD spokesman said. The westbound side of the highway was shut down as cops hunted for a car matching the description of the Porsche in connection with a theft around Knapp Street and Avenue V around 6:40 a.m., cops said. That’s when they spotted the luxury ride on the Belt. “When they approached the car on foot, the vehicle then began to flee the location but in the direction of the officers,” the spokesman said. “One officer then discharged his firearm at the vehicle.” The vehicle fled west on the Belt and cops did not give chase. The car was found abandoned at 823 Cropsey Avenue a short time later. The driver was wanted for stealing car parts, a police source said. There were no immediate arrests and it wasn’t clear if anyone in the car was injured. One officer was taken to a hospital for evaluation, cops said.
