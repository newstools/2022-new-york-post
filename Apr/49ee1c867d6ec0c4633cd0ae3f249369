HBO’s “Real Time With Bill Maher” tackled the infamous Oscar slap Friday night, with the eponymous host cracking that Jada Pinkett Smith should “thank God” that alopecia is the worst she’s dealing with. “If you are so lucky in life as to have that be your medical problem, just say ‘thank God,'” Maher cracked to his guests, attorney Laura Coates and former presidential and New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang. “It’s not life threatening. It’s part of — for most people, 80 percent of men, 50 percent of women — it’s part of aging.” “Aging is, trust me I know, it’s the degradation of the flesh. It happens to all of us,” the 66-year-old political comedian added. “And you know, just put on a f–king wig like everybody else at the Oscars if it bothers you so much.” Maher said Will Smith’s viral smackdown of Chris Rock over a joke about Pinkett Smith’s bald head exposed ugly “aspects of society,” like “toxic masculinity, victim culture and liberal hypocrisy,” as he claimed that most Americans associate the Academy Awards with the Democratic party and coastal elites. The left-leaning comic’s guests agreed they were distressed that a theater full of “woke” movie stars would stand and applaud Smith’s best actor trophy moments after his attack. “I remember as a prosecutor prosecuting quite a few assault and batteries and they didn’t stand by and be like ‘no no I’ve got the rest of my kid’s soccer game, I gotta stay for this,'”  Coates said. “So the fact that he was there to be like ‘here’s my award’ in and of itself was shocking, let alone a standing ovation.” Yang said he thought Smith would have had a thicker skin. “I do feel like it’s part of the job of a world famous celebrity attending an award show to absorb mild insults directed at you and yours,” the businessman-turned-Democrat said. “I ran for office and people said things around me I didn’t like and I didn’t get up and smack anyone.”
