A Long Island new construction mansion up for auction is accepting bids in cash or USD Coin, a digital stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Last asking $6.1 million, the suggested opening bid is $5.4 million. Cyber currency is not exactly stable these days — there are wide gaps in Bitcoin’s value, for example. However, the seller, who’s moving to Florida, is willing to take the risk, says Misha Haghani of auction house Paramount Realty USA. The seven-bedroom home at 199 Woodside Dr. was built in 2015 on three-quarters of an acre in Hewlett Bay Park, which is part of Long Island’s Five Towns, 23 miles from Manhattan. (The other towns are Lawrence, Cedarhurst, Woodmere and Inwood.) The smart-wired, Energy Star-certified green home comes with an indoor saltwater pool, an infinity-edge outdoor pool, a sauna for 12, an eight-person steam room, a home theater and a gym. There’s also an elevator, radiant heated floors, custom arches and moldings, a temperature-controlled 1,200-bottle wine room, a chef’s kitchen, an “au pair studio” and a three-car garage. The property has its own generator and filtered water system, as well. The listing brokers are Leah and Alex Sajovits, of Douglas Elliman. The auction will be held on June 16. Speaking of Douglas Elliman, its very own broker Sandra Ripert and her husband Éric Ripert, Le Bernardin’s executive chef, will be honored at this year’s City Harvest Gala on April 26 at Cipriani 42nd Street. It’s City Harvest’s first gala since lockdown. All proceeds will support their work rescuing 111 million pounds of food to help feed New Yorkers in need. Since the pandemic hit in 2020, when food insecurity spiked, City Harvest has collected and delivered more than 250 million pounds of food to hundreds of Big Apple soup kitchens and food pantries.
