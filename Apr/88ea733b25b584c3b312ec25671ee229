Leaf it out! Two squirrels go nuts over a piece of lettuce. The pair scrapped over scraps in 2 feet of snow. Admin worker Paula Badour, 56, saw the fur fly outside her house in Michigan. She said: “They both chased each other around and ended up right under my bedroom window. “I think it was so aggressive as they were fighting over food. “I was so happy that I was able to capture the fight – I love to get unique, action shots.” This story originally appeared in on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
