The Chicago Bulls have struggled to score efficiently throughout much of their first-round playoff series against the Milwaukee Bucks. They’re scoring just 94 points on 0.95 points per possession, putting up offensive ratings of 86.5, 113.9, 84.6 and 94.6 through the first four games of this series, with Game 2 the clear outlier. Unfortunately for the Bulls, things won’t get any better as Zach LaVine is expected to miss Game 5 after entering the NBA’s health and safety protocols. The Bulls were already facing an uphill battle against a Championship caliber Bucks defense but they’ll now have to do it without one of their best players. The Bulls have struggled to score at the rim in this series where they’ve shot 42.3, 44.4 and 56.5 percent in Games 1, 3, and 4, respectively. With this team unable to score from the most efficient area on the floor and not generating many free throw attempts, it’s tough to imagine a high offensive output here.  The opening total for Game 1 was 230 and despite adjusting down to 224.5, 222 and 219 and Games 2, 3 and 4, they can’t move the number enough for how poorly this Bulls offense has performed. The plays: Bucks-Bulls Under 217.5 and Bulls first-half team total Under 49.5.
