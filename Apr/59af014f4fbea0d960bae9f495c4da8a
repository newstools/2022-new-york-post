A metaverse company is offering the chance to ‘live forever’ in its virtual world even after you die in real life. Somnium Space has revealed plans to offer ‘immortality’ to its users with a new ‘Live Forever’ mode. This may sound like an episode of Black Mirror but the company thinks it can make ‘metaverse immortality’ happen. Someone wishing to jump on this chance to ‘live forever’ would need to provide a large amount of personal data to Somnium Space. Somnium Space is a virtual world where avatars can own land, trade items and socialize. The pubic can currently access this metaverse world via Steam. Artur Sychov, CEO and founder of Somnium Space, recently revealed to Vice his plans to add ‘Live Forever’ mode. He told the publication: “Literally, if I die—and I have this data collected—people can come or my kids, they can come in, and they can have a conversation with my avatar, with my movements, with my voice. “You will meet the person. And you would maybe for the first 10 minutes while talking to that person, you would not know that it’s actually AI. That’s the goal.” Sychov’s Live Forever mode was inspired by the tragic death of his father from an aggressive form of cancer. Sychov hopes that dead loved ones would still be able to talk to you via their avatar in the metaverse long after they’ve passed away in real life. The intention is for your immortal avatar to move, talk and act just like you. The Live Forever mode is not currently on Somnium Space and anyone wanting to try it would have to opt-in and pay. A batch of test subjects is aiming to try it out next year. This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
