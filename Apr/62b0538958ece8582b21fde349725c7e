White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki is leaving the Biden administration for a new home at MSNBC — perhaps the most qualified hire the network’s ever made, considering her expertise at prevarication. Her record is unmatched as a deft diver into deep denial and utter bull to defend the indefensible and deny reality — which is MSNBC’s purpose. Some highlights: Those NBC News staffers reportedly upset that Psaki’s appointment will tarnish their brand plainly haven’t watched enough MSNBC to realize how tarnished it already is. As for Psaki, she’ll no doubt enjoy a new gig where no one ever asks her a difficult question.
