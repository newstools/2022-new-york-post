Mourners gathered Wednesday to lay Kade Lewin, the innocent 12-year-old boy senselessly gunned down in Brooklyn last month, to rest — but the Big Apple’s vocal, tough-on-crime mayor was a last-minute no-show. Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain who banked his mayoralty on public safety and driving down gun violence, was meant to attend a public viewing ahead of the boy’s open-casket funeral at the New Life Tabernacle Church in Brooklyn — but canceled at the eleventh hour. Hizzoner, whose office blamed the no-show on a vague “scheduling conflict,” had earlier decried Kade’s slaying and has repeatedly vowed to clean up the city amid a surge in crime. Despite the mayor’s absence, a heavy NYPD presence was stationed outside the church as hundreds of grief-stricken New Yorkers arrived to pay their respects at the viewing ahead of the 11 a.m. service. Kade’s sobbing mother, Suzette Lewin, could be seen rocking back and forth as she sat in front of her son’s casket, which had been adorned with white roses, a football and a basketball. The funeral comes three weeks after the seventh-grader was shot in the head while he was eating in a parked minivan in East Flatbush with his 20-year-old cousin and his 8-year-old niece. His cousin, Jenna Ellis, survived despite suffering gunshot wounds to her jaw and stomach. The little girl, Kylie, wasn’t struck by the volley of bullets. Kade’s father, Rudolph Ford, could be seen cradling the 8-year-old inside the church ahead of the funeral service. In the aftermath of the March 31 shooting, the mayor held a press conference outside the grieving family’s home and vowed to hunt down Kade’s killer. “Whose child is next?” Adams shouted as he clutched a pair of the boy’s sneakers. Hizzoner also apologized to Kade’s family and vowed to personally contribute to his burial costs, saying: “We’re so sorry. Those who took their lives will be found.” Kade will be buried at the Canarsie Cemetery later Wednesday.
