A Louisiana woman was stabbed to death on a Facebook Live video after her killer allegedly tied her hands to a car steering wheel using jumper cables, cops and reports said Tuesday. Earl Lee Johnson Jr., 35, was arrested for the murder of Janice David, 34, who was found beaten and fatally stabbed in a car at 9:52 p.m. Monday, Baton Rouge Police Department said. The Facebook Live session lasted about 15 minutes and came after a three or four-day “drug binge,” Sgt. L’Jean McKneely told reporters Tuesday. “Apparently they were involved in some drug usage together for a couple of days and the end result — as everyone has seen on Facebook Live — is a very gruesome, very evil act,” McKneely said. Johnson allegedly choked, beat then stabbed David, cops said. The suspect had also allegedly tied David’s hands to the car steering wheel with jumper cables, WBRZ reported. Someone reported the gruesome footage to Facebook, which notified police. Responding officers found the car abandoned in a parking lot of an office building called Sherwood Tower, reports said. Johnson was arrested Monday on an unrelated car theft case, where he was allegedly injured during a police pursuit. He admitted to the killing when questioned, the TV station said. Johnson had been convicted of armed robbery in 2007 and was sentenced to 15 years behind bars, WRBZ said. David’s cousin Terri Austin called the situation “very horrible.” “She didn’t deserve to die like this… no one does,” Austin told WAFB. “I really thought, you know, when they say she died that it would have been a vehicle wreck or something like that. Wouldn’t never dream that someone would do this to her.” With Post wires
