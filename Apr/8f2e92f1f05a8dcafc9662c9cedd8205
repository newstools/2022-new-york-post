A small plane crashed into a General Mills plant in Georgia Thursday evening. The crash happened just after 7 p.m., shortly after takeoff and less than a mile away from Covington Municipal Airport’s runway, 30 miles east of Atlanta, according to WAGA-TV. Pictures of the scene published by the station showed thick black smoke rising from the plant and several damaged trailers. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured, the station said.
