Blender magazine founder Regina Joseph’s West Village digs are on the market for the first time in more than a quarter century. The charming maisonette, at 130 Barrow St., is asking $2.49 million. Joseph bought the unit for $500,000 in 1997 — two years after she was named one of New York magazine’s “Cyber Sixty.” These days, she’s a superforecaster for US government agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. At 1,517 square feet, the two-/three-bedroom unit comes with a 150-square-foot multi-level garden. Guests at her apartment over the years have included musicians from the Clash; artists including Fred Tomaselli, the late Nancy Spero and John Bowman; and fashion designers like Tuleh’s Bryan Bradley. The home features 17-foot ceilings, white wood floors and an open living concept. There’s a 20-foot-wide dining room that seats eight and a flex area that Joseph used as a library/gym. The large master bedroom is on the upper level. Original features include 18-foot-high windows, architectural iron gates protecting the front door and cast-iron columns in the courtyard. Joseph added a decorative fireplace and a bathroom with a Japanese cedar wood-fronted soaking tub.  Built in 1931, the building converted to condos in 1983. The building features a landscaped roof deck overlooking the Hudson and windowed elevators overlooking a planted atrium with ginkgo trees. The listing broker is Shii Ann Huang, of Compass.
