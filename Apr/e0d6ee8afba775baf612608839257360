Kyle Kuzma’s love for fashion landed him a modeling gig with his own team — and fans are having a field day over the photos. The Washington Wizards forward showed off the team’s new City Edition uniform for the 2022-23 season in a photoshoot that has fans roasting him on social media. “Horrible man just horrible that’s isn’t style its a mess,” one fan tweeted. The images, which were taken outdoors, feature Kuzma rocking the Wizards’ pink Cherry Blossom jersey tucked into floral-printed dress pants and a matching blazer. The Wizards shared the photos on Twitter with the caption, “@kylekuzma knows how to pull off a fit and this jersey adds just the right amount of drip.” Kuzma also posted the photos to his Instagram page with an identical caption. Unsurprisingly, some Instagram users didn’t mince words when it came to expressing their feelings about Kuzma’s look. “Might be the worst fit I’ve ever seen,” one person wrote in the comments, while another said the former Laker “went Hollywood” with his bright look. Elsewhere, a fan noted that they hadn’t “seen this side of Kuz before.” Many fans have seen this side of Kuzma, though, as he’s long been passionate about fashion. Further, the 26-year-old’s NBA peers have also enjoyed poking fun at his ensembles throughout the year. Last November, LeBron James — Kuzma’s NBA championship teammate in 2020 — trolled him for the oversized pink sweater that he wore to Capital One Arena before a loss to Charlotte. Washington debuted its new uniforms Tuesday — the team’s official Cherry Blossom Night — in a 107-94 loss to the Bulls at home. The Wizards joined the Washington Nationals in celebration of the District of Cherry Blossoms, becoming the first MLB and NBA teams from the same market.
