Angelina Jolie surprised customers in a coffee shop in Lviv on Saturday while on a mercy mission to the refugees sheltering in the western Ukrainian city. Dressed casually in a baggy gray sweater and loose matching pants, with a backpack slung over one shoulder, Jolie was seen beaming as she signed an autograph for a fan. She waved to other locals as they gasped in recognition — except for one young boy wearing headphones, who remained engrossed by his phone. “I just went to have a coffee, and it’s only Angelina Jolie,” wrote Maya Pidgoretska, who posted the video to Facebook. “Ukraine is simply supported by the entire world.” The “Maleficent” star, 46, a longtime goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, was in Lviv to visit children evacuated from Mariupol and other devastated towns, the BBC reported. She was also set to meet with Ukrainian volunteers and medical personnel working in the relief effort. Later, she was seen chatting with refugees outside the city’s main train station — a major hub for those fleeing the Russian invasion.
