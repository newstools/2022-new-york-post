Two crooks pulled a gun on clerks at the Zaza Exotics smoke shop in Brooklyn and made off with $1,000 cash and $4,800 worth of CBD liquid, cops said Saturday. Surveillance cameras caught clear images of the masked male suspects as they ripped off the store at 122 Cozine Ave. in Brooklyn on Friday around 3 p.m., terrorizing its clerks, authorities said. The cameras caught the suspects as they casually walked into the store. One of the creeps pointed a gun at the 20-year-old clerk on duty, then reached across the counter to grab his collar. That suspect was wearing a dark-colored Nike hooded sweatshirt, black jeans, sunglasses, a white surgical mask, a black balaclava and yellow and black gloves at the time. The worker crouched behind the counter, and his sweatshirt was partially pulled over his head. Meanwhile, the second robber — dressed in a gray hooded sweatshirt, black ripped jeans,  a black balaclava and black and blue sneakers — made his way behind the counter, where he punched a 27-year-old clerk in the face and pushed him to the floor. The gunman then let off a single shot that didn’t struck anyone, and the men behind the counter tumbled over each other. His accomplice grabbed two boxes which held cash and handed them to his partner then snatched a black bag, and the two took off. They were last seen jumping into a white four-door sedan that headed southbound on Cozine Avenue. Anyone with information about the robbery is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
