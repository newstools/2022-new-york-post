As part of The Post’s 2022 NFL Draft preview, we examine what the Giants might do at each position. Today: Tight ends Next up: Offensive line. Here is what the Giants will likely do at some point during the draft when it comes to the tight end position: They will find one and take one. How do we know this? There is not much on the roster. The free agent signing of Ricky Seals-Jones adds a five-year veteran with 90 career receptions for 1,044 yards and 10 touchdowns, serving mostly in a reserve role for four different teams. Do not expect miracles here. There is no other proven NFL talent at this position on the scene, as former first-round pick Evan Engram signed with the Jaguars — the Giants did not really try to retain him — and one-and-done veteran Kyle Rudolph was released. No tight end is expected to come off the board in the first round, and when the Giants strike will be interesting. They might be able wait until Day 3 in Rounds 4-7 to find a mid-level prospect who can make the team and develop. Trey McBride (Colorado State) is probably the best of the bunch, but he figures to go on Day 2. The same with Jeremy Ruckert (Ohio State). After that, it is in the eye of the beholder with Greg Dulcich (Ohio State), Jalen Wydermyer (Texas A&M), Charlie Kolar (Iowa State) and Jake Ferguson (Wisconsin). A wild card here is Jelani Woods, who has great size (6-foot-7) and was not much of a pass-catcher at Oklahoma State but blossomed into a threat last season for Virginia.
