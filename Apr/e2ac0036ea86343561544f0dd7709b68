A creep was captured on video smirking after grabbing a woman’s buttocks as she was waiting for the subway in Greenwich Village, cops said Friday. The incident happened just before 5 p.m. March 31 while the 26-year-old woman was standing on the platform for a northbound D line at the West Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue station in Manhattan, cops said. Footage shows the suspect moving close to the woman from behind and then appearing to grab her rear before strolling away smiling. The man then takes off and was still in the wind Friday afternoon.
