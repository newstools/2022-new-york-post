The Queens pawnshop owner who was savagely beaten with a metal rod last month — so severely that cops initially thought he had been shot — has died of his injuries, cops said Wednesday. Arasb Shoughi, 60, was inside the Global Pawn Shop on Jamaica Avenue near 179th Street around 1 p.m. March 28 when the male suspect viciously attacked him during a robbery, police said. Shoughi — who lived in Jamaica Estates — succumbed to his injuries Sunday, authorities said Wednesday morning. The case has been deemed a homicide, police said. Disturbing footage released by the NYPD days after the attack shows Shoughi on the floor desperately trying to raise his arms to stop the constant flurry of blows. But his black-clad attacker instead repeatedly pushed the helpless victim back down on the floor to continue the bloody assault. Police confirmed Wednesday that the suspect — who remained on the loose — made off with miscellaneous jewelry from the store. Responding officers initially assumed Shoughi had been shot in the head, and only learned he had suffered blunt force trauma once he was transported to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. The alleged attacker was originally seen in a dark blue jacket with a hood, face mask and green Adidas baseball cap, but newer images clearly show the dark-haired suspect’s face as he walks in earmuffs and sunglasses. He is described as roughly 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, with a medium build and medium complexion. He was last seen fleeing westbound on Jamaica Avenue, the NYPD said.
