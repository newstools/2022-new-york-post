Danny DeVito confesses he’s a contradiction who is simultaneously a softie and a bit salty. “I”m very emotional,” the actor, 77, exclusively told The Post at the premiere of his latest movie, “The Survivor.” “This movie that won the Academy Award? ‘CODA,’ (I saw it) three times — at home, thank God, because I was blubbering.” And yet, the “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” star confessed that he loves to “break balls.” “I’m from New Jersey,” he explained. “So in Jersey, one of the major things for kids to do, boys and girls, is to break balls. Constantly.” The diminutive actor acknowledged that he still likes to stir it up daily. “Every day, you gotta make it your business to bust chops,” he said gleefully. DeVito also is one of those actors who enjoys being recognized and knows that the public has a soft spot for him. “I’m glad — I love people. I’m happy about that,” he enthused. “I’m doing a lot of stuff, I love work, so I keep working, and I love that I’ve got fans and an audience, so it’s good.” His latest film “The Survivor” is based on the true story of boxer Harry Haft, who survived Auschwitz by being forced to participate in boxing matches against other prisoners as entertainment for the officers. It’s directed by Barry Levinson. The two first worked together in the 1987 movie “Tin Men.” “When I read the script it was like a bolt of lightning,” DeVito said. “You wanted to know more and more about it. It hits you like a ton of bricks.”
