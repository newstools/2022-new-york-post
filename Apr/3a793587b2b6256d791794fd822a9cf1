“Saturday Night Live” took shots at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife Ginni Thomas over reports that Ginni exchanged text messages with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows pushing him to overturn the 2020 election results. Clarence Thomas, played by “SNL” veteran Kenan Thompson, and Ginni Thomas, played by Kate McKinnon, appear as guests on the “Fox and Friends” morning news show. The hosts ask Ginni Thomas her reaction to the left “losing their minds over a couple of completely normal texts” that she allegedly sent to Meadows. “I don’t want any trouble. I take my duty as the Yoko Ono of the Supreme Court very seriously. All I want is a tidal wave of biblical vengeance to wash away the Biden crime family all the way to Gitmo and then and then we Release the Kraken,” she answers, referencing a phrase associated with conspiracy theories around the 2020 election. When the hosts ask Thomas if he talks to his wife about this, he just chuckles and says “Some say yes, some say no.” Ginni Thomas allegedly exchanged 29 texts with Meadows in the weeks after Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden, the Washington Post and CBS News reported two weeks ago. “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!” Thomas wrote in Nov. 10, 2020, message after most media outlets confirmed a Biden victory for presidency, according to the Post. “You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” Thomas never mentions her husband or the Supreme Court in the texts, which were among the more than 2,300 turned over by Meadows to the House select committee investigating the riot. The messages did allegedly include her referencing “The Biden crime family” and pushing Meadows not to concede Biden’s victory. A final message sent four days after Jan. 6 bemoaning what Thomas calls “the end of Liberty.”
