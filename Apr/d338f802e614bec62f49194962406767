After an ugly end to Saturday’s game at Yankee Stadium with fans throwing beer and trash onto the field at Guardians outfielders, the 39,050 in attendance on Sunday avoided any repeat behavior. The Yankees brought in extra security for the game, a team spokesman said, but the 10-2 win went off without any incidents. About an hour before first pitch Sunday, there appeared to be a security guard stationed in the first row of the right-field seats and another in the section next to the Guardians’ bullpen in left-center field. The only notable carryover from Saturday was the fans showering boos down on Guardians center fielder Myles Straw each time he came to the plate. Saturday’s incident started in the ninth inning after Cleveland’s Steven Kwan ran into the left-field wall trying to catch Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s game-tying double. As Kwan was tended to by a trainer and manager Terry Francona, Straw climbed the wall to get face-to-face with a fan who Straw said had been mocking Kwan. Then, after Gleyber Torres hit a walk-off single that Straw and right fielder Oscar Mercado chased down near the warning track, fans started throwing beers and trash in their direction onto the field. Both teams then ran out into right field, with the Yankees trying to urge their fans to settle down and stop throwing things. After the game, Straw called Yankees fans the “worst fan base on the planet.” “I mean, that’s an emotional reaction to the moment,” Aaron Boone said Sunday. “Certainly understand that, but would disagree with that.” As of Sunday afternoon, no fans had been disciplined for their role in the incident. That it happened as the game ended with fans flooding to the exits, and not back to their seats, made it challenging to identify those who were involved, Yankees personnel said.
