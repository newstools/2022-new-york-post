Your weekly Target trips just got even better. Target super fan and personal finance expert, Jessica Spangler, posted a video revealing why you should order Starbucks right when you get to Target. Before you begin wandering the aisles of Target, you’re going to need a caffeine kick. Most Targets have a Starbucks inside of them, and though many decide to wait and treat themselves to a drink on their way out of the store, Spangler suggested hitting Starbucks first instead. She explained that she gets her coffee before shopping so that she can get her free refill before she leaves. Spangler said you can get free refills on “hot coffee, cold brew, iced coffee, or tea,” but not on any specialty drinks. “Just make sure you have the Starbucks app downloaded on your phone,” she said. Starbucks customer service said that this only works at participating stores and you must use the app to take advantage of the free refill benefits. According to the coffee chain, your free refill is only valid during the same store visit as your original drink order. Many viewers were thrilled to hear this trick, saying: “We so need your try this,” and “This is dangerous information for me to have.” Starbucks baristas even confirmed her free refill tip, saying: “IM A BARISTA AND THIS IS 100% TRUE!!” “You can also get refills on cold teas (green, passion, and black teas).” “You can do this at a regular Starbucks,” said another coffee lover. “We do take the Starbucks app,” said another barista. “We can’t scan the QR code for points, but the gift card barcode.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
