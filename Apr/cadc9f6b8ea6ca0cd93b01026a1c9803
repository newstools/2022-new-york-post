The Yankees may be worth $7 billion but lately their offense isn’t worth a bag of beans. New York visits Detroit and in Seve, we trust. We’ve been waiting for Luis Severino to return to form and he may be back after his two-hit, five-inning gem against the high-flying Blue Jays. The Tigers go with Eduardo Rodriguez. E-Rod has allowed five runs over 7 ²/₃ in his two starts. The Bombers will eventually get back to playing long ball. Taking the Yanks for 20 units. .. and … 10 units on the Nats. Erick Fedde throws at home against the visiting D’Backs. Al dente? Overcooked? Neither. “Feddeccini” has given up four runs over 10 innings. Arizona counters with Merrill Kelly who is still 0-0 after two starts even though he hasn’t allowed a run over 9 ¹/₃ . Kelly has been good, but when if comes to producing runs the Snakes don’t bite. The Mets were down 4-1 but scored three in the fifth inning before Francisco Lindor’s hit in the 10th won it, 5-4 over the Giants. Four-game winning streak has us at +52 dykstras.
