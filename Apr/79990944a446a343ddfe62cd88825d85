Federal agents seized more than $700,000 worth of cocaine at the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities announced Friday. The Customs and Border Protection said field operations members on Thursday “intercepted” 37 packages of the drug, weighing more than 92 pounds, hidden inside a white Chevrolet van crossing the Hidalgo International Bridge. The bridge connects the Rio Grande and Mexican state of Tamaulipas, according to CNN. The narcotics were valued at $715,00, according to CBP. “Our CBP officers remain vigilant and rely on their experience and all available tools and resources to thwart this smuggling attempt,” said Carlos Rodriguez, director of the Hidalgo/Pharr/Anzalduas Port of Entry. CBP’s Office of Field Operations seized both the cocaine and the car, and the case is being investigated by special agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations, CBS said. The seizure comes after last month smugglers took an SUV loaded with almost 650 pounds of marijuana across the river separating Texas from Mexico in a failed smuggling attempt.
