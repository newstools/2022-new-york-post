A mind bending optical illusion showing a stack of cubes has left viewers baffled — with few able to work out what’s going on. A video shared on YouTube shows the cube art placed on a flat surface — but can you work it out? Michael Cheshire, who built the art, explained that the illusion is a two-dimensional work made from wood veneers on a solid background. In the description he said: “The impression of depth is caused by the choice of three colors of wood arranged in a hexagon to look like a 3D cube. “With many hexagons arranged to overlap and of differing sizes the 3D effect becomes magnified. By adding the larger outer hexagons, makes another illusory cube which encloses and balances the whole design. “The gaps between also help to give the structure a 3D effect overall. Even when shown that it is flat, we are compelled to see it as 3D.” The illusion was shared as part of the best illusion of the year contest which celebrates the most mind boggling images from around the world. The competition included a controversial entry which involves a pair of crocs and socks as people were split over what they saw. “Under normal lighting conditions, all people see the Crocs as pink,” creators Pascal Wallisch and Michael Karlovich explained, speaking of their illusion. They noted that when put under green light, most people see the same crocs as grey. “However, some people — those that believe the socks are white, even though they appear green — are able to look past appearances and see the crocs as pink, just like they did under regular light,” Wallisch and Karlovich wrote. “Amazingly, when we make the socks actually white, people agree that the crocs are grey, illustrating the power of assumptions.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced here with permission.
