The 26-year-old Wisconsin doctor found dead on a hiking trail over the weekend tragically fell to her death when the ground beneath her collapsed, authorities have revealed. Kelsey Musgrove’s body was found partially buried in a steep clay bank at Potato River Falls in Gurney on Sunday — a week after she set off on a solo hike, Iron County Sheriff Paul Samardich said late Wednesday. Musgrove, a cardiothoracic surgery fellow at the University of Wisconsin, suffered traumatic injuries and died within minutes of the fall, according to her autopsy. The sheriff said it appeared that Musgrove had veered off the observation area at the 90-foot waterfall in a bid to get closer to the river. “While walking along the edge of the embankment, it appears that the ground beneath her collapsed, bringing her down the bank along with clay and rocks,” Samardich said. It wasn’t immediately clear how far Musgrove fell. Musgrove had set off on the hike on March 26 but was reported missing after she failed to return to her home in Middleton, some 280 miles away. Local authorities started scouring the hiking trail on March 30 and located her empty car in the Potato River Falls parking lot. Her body wasn’t discovered until April 3. In the wake of her tragic death, the sheriff issued a warning to other solo hikers. “Clay banks are always unstable and be undermined in areas not visible from above,” Samardich said. “When hiking, please stay on marked trail and observation areas. If you choose to hike alone, always make sure someone knows your route of travel and when you plan to return.”
