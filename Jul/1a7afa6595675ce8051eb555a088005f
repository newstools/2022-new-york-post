Whether Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are in Brooklyn or not, all signs are Steve Nash will remain the Nets head coach. And he’ll have more pressure on him than ever before. He could have a pricey star-studded contender with what could be one-year championship window and no more alibis. Or if the Nets acquiesce to Durant’s trade request, Nash could end up with a tough rebuild on his hands, working with a depleted roster and a reshuffled coaching staff. Either way, the 48-year-old is going to have his work cut out for him in Year 3 on the bench. Nash has seen his rotations and his endgame management questioned. In last season’s playoff sweep at the hands of the Celtics, his perceived lack of strategic adjustments came under fire. Then this offseason, the Nets lost three full-time assistant coaches and a host of other valuable staffers. The microscope of the NBA world will be on him.
