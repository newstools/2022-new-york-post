The White House said it believes Iran is providing Russia with “hundreds” of drones in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Monday the US has “information” that Iran is preparing to train Russian soldiers to use the drones, which includes those that are weapons-capable, as soon as this month. It was unclear if any of the unmanned systems were already given to the Russian, he added. “Our information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline,” he told reporters Monday. Sullivan said the move shows Russia’s constant bombing of Ukraine, which it went to war with in February, was “coming at a cost to the sustainment of its weapons.” The latest development comes right before President Joe Biden travels to Israel and Saudi Arabia, where Iran’s nuclear program and its other activities in the Mid-East will be a crucial discussion point. Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have resisted global efforts to punish Russia for its actions in Ukraine because of domestic interests. Iran also doled out similar drones to Yemen’s Houthi reels in their attack against Saudi Arabia before ceasefire was reached earlier this year, Sullivan noted. In recent weeks Russian has gained territory in the eastern region of Ukraine. With Post wires
