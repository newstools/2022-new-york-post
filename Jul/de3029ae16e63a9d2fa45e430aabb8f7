The Rangers created some much-needed cap space on Wednesday by trading veteran defenseman Patrik Nemeth, a 2025 second-round pick and a conditional future pick to the Coyotes for prospect Ty Emberson. For the conditional future pick, Arizona has the option of acquiring the Rangers’ own 2024 third-rounder or its own 2026 second-rounder. The trade relieves the Rangers of Nemeth’s $2.5 million cap hit each of the next two seasons. With so many other holes to fill, Nemeth was a logical buyout/trade candidate. Nemeth skated in just 63 games with the Rangers this season, recording two goals and five assists. He missed a good chunk of time due to a lingering battle with COVID-19 and other personal reasons, but the 30-year-old Swede was ultimately a healthy scratch for the final 15 games of the season. Nemeth competed in the Rangers’ first five playoff games before Justin Braun took his spot. The Rangers are spending $5.625 million per year over the next seven years on new second-line center Vincent Trocheck.
