A blind psychic who allegedly predicted 9/11 claimed there would be water shortages in 2022. Baba Vanga, dubbed “Nostradamus of the Balkans,” claimed that large cities would be struck by water shortages because of drought. She said it would result in political consequences as alternative solutions were sought, the Mirror reported. It comes as Portugal and Italy have told their respective populations to restrict their water usage, with the latter expected to go through its worst drought since the 1950s. The clairvoyant also claimed there would be more earthquakes and tsunamis — with “intense bouts of flood” in Australia and parts of Asia. Heavy rainfall and flooding have wreaked havoc on Australia’s East Coast on and off for much of the year. Other predictions for the year included famine in India due to temperature drops that will cause locust swarms, another pandemic discovered in Siberia, alien arrival via asteroid and a virtual reality takeover. Baba Vanga, born Vangelia Pandeva Dimitrova, lived a regular life until she was 12, when she lost her sight and claimed she was given a rare gift from God that allowed her to see the future. She died in August 1996 from breast cancer but her disciples claim her predictions stretched for years after her passing. Baba Vanga reportedly said in 1989: “Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. “The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.” Many believe this was in relation to the September 11 terror attacks, while some link a prediction to Europe “ceasing to exist” in 2017 to Brexit. Another accurate prediction was that the 44th United States president would be black, and Barack Obama stepped into the role. However, she did say he would be the last. It’s also claimed she predicted Chernobyl and Princess Diana’s death.
