Paige Spiranac is pulling for Cameron Smith in the 150th British Open. Taking to Instagram on Thursday, the “Playing A Round” podcast host, 29, revealed that she’s rooting for the Australian golfer at the Open Championship, quipping to followers that she hopes her messages “ages well come Sunday.” “It’s Open Championship time! Who do you have winning? I have my money on Cam Smith and it looks like he had a great start,” Spiranac said. “Hopefully this ages well come Sunday lol.” Smith did get off to a fiery start in Thursday’s opening round, finishing the day in third at 5-under. Cameron Young held the lead at 8-under after the first round, followed by Rory McIlroy at 6-under. Smith, who is currently ranked 6th in the world, had an impressive showing at the 2022 Masters in April, tying for third with Shane Lowry. He finished in a six-way tie for 10th in last week’s Scottish Open. In addition to Smith, Spiranac also told her Twitter followers that she’s cheering for Tiger Woods as he continues his return to the sport following last year’s horrifying car crash. Spiranac noted how the terrain of St. Andrews may be better to manage versus that of the “very hilly” Augusta National, where Woods completed all four rounds in April. “As we know Tiger Woods is still recovering after his injury and having a little bit more of a flat terrain will keep his body in shape all the way until day four of the tournament,” Spiranac explained Tuesday. Much like Spiranac, McIlroy also believes Woods can win the Open. “I think the way the golf course is and the way the conditions are, I could certainly see it,’’ McIlroy said. “It’s going to be a game of chess this week, and no one’s been better at playing that sort of chess game on a golf course than Tiger over the last 20 years.” Woods shot a 6-over 78 in Thursday’s opening round.
