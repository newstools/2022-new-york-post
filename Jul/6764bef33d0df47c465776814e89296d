Are you a Marvel fan with $25 million to spare? The superhero franchise and East Continental Gems announced a collaboration of real-life gemstones inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe Friday at San Diego Comic-Con. Marvel Entertainment tweeted a picture of the sparklers, calling it “one of the rarest collectibles” from SDCC. Each of the six stones is placed in a custom Infinity Gauntlet like the one Thanos (Josh Brolin) wears in the movies. “Fans and collectors are a very important consumer for Marvel since they truly live the Marvel lifestyle every day and are always seeking to connect with the brand in new and unique ways. We feel this authentic gemstone collection is cool and unexpected and extends the reach of the Marvel brand,” said Paul Gitter, of Marvel Consumer Products. Here’s a breakdown of the real-life stones and what they represent in the Marvel Universe, according to its website: Marvel Studios also released its timelines for Phase 5 of what’s next in the MCU. Attendees were the first to see the trailer for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and caught glimpses of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Phase 6 will conclude with two Avengers movies in 2025: “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” and “Avengers: Secret Wars.”
