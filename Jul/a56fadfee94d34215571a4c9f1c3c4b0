Law enforcement officials with the Orlando Police Department evacuated a parking garage at the Universal Orlando CityWalk late Saturday due to what they said was a fight involving “several juveniles.” Police were quick to assure residents and parkgoers that the commotion did not involve any gun violence, as those nearby had been rushed off the premises. “Our officers responded to the parking garage at the 6000 block of Universal Blvd. regarding a fight between several juveniles. Out of an abundance of caution, the premises are being evacuated as our officers ensure everyone is safe. NO shots fired & NO injuries reported,” the police department tweeted. Earlier in the day, there had been a false alarm at the Florida Mall in Orlando when shoppers hid and ran after hearing loud noises that turned out to be fireworks, not gunshots, local Fox35 reported. The CityWalk is a massive shopping and dining hub located in between the Universal Studios Florida and Universal’s Islands of Adventure theme parks. Police tweeted instructions for those who may have left personal belongings behind during the evacuation. Those who were still on the property were told they could retrieve their items from the Guest Services area, while those who had already left could call the following day. Police finally gave the all-clear at 1:12 a.m. Sunday, tweeting again that there had been no shots fired or injuries, and adding that no weapons were found at the scene. “Thank you for your patience as our officers worked to ensure everyone remained safe and conducted the investigation,” police said. According to Fox35, police did not make any arrests in connection with the fight.
