The Los Angeles Rams evidently want nothing to do with the franchise’s former affiliate city, St. Louis. On Thursday night, the evening before coaches were due to report to training camp, the Rams unveiled their flashy Super Bowl 56 championship rings. Notably, however, the ring displays just one Lombardi Trophy — rather bluntly ignoring the franchise’s 1999 Super Bowl championship, a title captured when the team was still based in St. Louis. The Rams relocated to Los Angeles following the 2015 season, ending a 21-year stint in Missouri. In November, the NFL and Rams owner Stan Kroenke reached a settlement with St. Louis officials for $790 million following an initial lawsuit that claimed the NFL did not hold good faith negotiations in trying to prevent the franchise from relocating. Each Super Bowl ring has 1.12 carats of round diamonds, symbolizing the importance of Jan. 12 in Rams’ history following the franchise’s relocation. On Jan. 12, 2016, the relocation was approved by the NFL; on Jan. 12, 2017, Los Angeles hired Sean McVay as the team’s head coach; on Jan. 12, 2019, the Rams secured their first playoff victory since returning to Los Angeles. The Super Bowl 56 ring further pays homage to the Rams’ new home, displaying palm trees, a sparkling view of SoFi Stadium, and a small part of the football that was used in the game. There are also 20 carats of white diamonds on each ring, a number indicative of SoFi Stadium’s official opening in 2020.
