Carlos Carrasco’s finest start in six weeks and Eduardo Escobar’s first true power surge of the season lifted the Mets to another series win on Sunday. Carrasco hurled 5 ²/₃ innings of one-run ball and Escobar homered for the third consecutive game as the Mets took two of the three against the Rangers this weekend with a 4-1 victory at Citi Field. Carrasco had posted a 6.20 ERA over his previous nine starts since May 15, but the veteran righty allowed one run — a solo homer by Texas catcher Jonah Heim in the third — on six hits with one walk and eight strikeouts before Joely Rodriguez replaced him with two outs and two runners on base in the sixth. The 35-year-old Carrasco (9-4, 4.54) had surrendered nine runs combined over the first three innings over his previous two outings, but he retired the side in order in Sunday’s first inning and erased a one-out single by Nathaniel Lowe in the second by picking him off at first base. Starling Marte staked Carrasco to a quick lead with a solo homer to left-center in the first against Texas starter Jon Gray, his ninth of the season and second in as many days after an 18-game drought. Heim jumped Carrasco for a first-pitch blast for a 1-1 game in the third, his 12th of the year, which is the most among American League catchers this season. After Pete Alonso reached second base on a strikeout — on a wild pitch and a throwing error by Heim — Jeff McNeil pushed the Mets back ahead with an RBI double to right. Escobar then went deep for the third time in this series, crushing Gray’s 0-2 four-seam fastball into the Mets’ bullpen in right for a 4-1 game. Rodriguez, Adam Ottavino and Edwin Diaz (18th save) combined to record the final 10 outs for the first-place Mets, who will open a three-game series Monday night in Cincinnati. The Rangers got the tying run to the plate against Diaz in the ninth, but he fanned Mitch Garver with two runners aboard and retired Steven Duggar on a fly ball to left for the final out.
