Television producing legend Norman Lear rang in his 100th birthday Wednesday by singing Dean Martin’s “That’s Amore” and shared a few bits of wisdom with his fans. Lear — who was born on July 27, 1922, in New Haven, Connecticut — shared the video on Instagram, marveling at the powers of modern science and how it was responsible for getting him to his 100th year, reports Deadline. “My God the miracle of being alive with everything that’s available to us,” said Lear, noting he was in Vermont. “Me turning 100 tomorrow. Did you hear me? Tomorrow I turn 100. That’s as believable to me as today I’m 99.” Lear revolutionized family television in the 1970s with shows such as “Good Times,” “Sanford and Son,” “One Day at a Time” and “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman” by dealing with topics such as sexuality, mental health, abortion and drug use. In recognition for his work, Lear has won five Emmy awards and is currently up for a sixth nomination with his show “Live In Front of a Studio Audience: The Facts of Life and Diff’rent Strokes.” Lear was inducted into the Emmy Awards hall of fame in 1984. “He’s 100 years old and still working hard — that says a lot about his drive and passion,” said Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Tony Vinciquerra said to Variety. “If you look at his body of work, some of his shows were controversial when they aired, but he pushed people to think differently about issues like race and bigotry when it was most needed. His vision and his ideas are always spot-on.” Following the cover, Lear then gave his fans some advice to live in the moment and treasure every second of life. “Living in the moment,” he said. “The moment between past and present, present and past, the moment between after and next. The hammock in the middle of after and next/ Treasure it. Use it — with love.”
