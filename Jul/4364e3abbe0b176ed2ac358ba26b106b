Alfa Romeo driver Zhou Guanyu was stretchered off following a major crash at Turn 1 of the British Grand Prix on Sunday. Zhou, who started ninth, got caught up in a three-car accident with Mercedes’ George Russell and Alpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly. Gasly tried to squeeze into a gap between Russell and Zhou, making contact with Russell, who then went into Zhou. The Alfa Romeo was flipped upside down and skidded into the gravel above the tire barrier and into the catch fencing at Abbey corner. Zhou, a rookie and the first ever Chinese driver in F1, was extracted from the car after a long period. After an evaluation, Zhou was cleared and released from the medical center. He and Williams driver Alex Albon, who was involved in a separate first-lap crash, were both conscious when they were taken to the medical center to get examined. Zhou took to Twitter after the crash and was thankful for the “Halo” protection device on the car. “I’m ok, all clear. Halo saved me today,” Zhou wrote. “Thanks everyone for your kind messages!” The other crash involved Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel, who went into the back of Albon. Alpha Tauri’s Yuki Tsunoda and Alpine’s Esteban Ocon were caught up in that one. Additionally, the FIA and F1 released a statement saying that protesters had made it onto the track at Silverstone following the red flag, and had been removed. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen had taken the lead from Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz at Turn 1, but since the race was red flagged so quickly, Sainz was again on pole at the restart.
