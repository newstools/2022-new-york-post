Kate Moss testified in her ex-boyfriend Johnny Depp’s defamation trial because she “had to say the truth,” the British supermodel claimed in a new interview set to air Sunday. Moss, 48, appeared virtually in May during Depp’s lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard to rebut testimony that said Depp pushed Moss down the stairs when the pair dated in the 1990s. “I know the truth about Johnny,” Moss told the Desert Island Discs, according to the Sunday Times. “I had to say that truth.” Moss added that she believes in “fairness and justice” in the interview, according to the Times. Moss’ testimony was one of the most highly-publicized moments of the headline-grabbing, six-week trial, which ended with a jury largely ruling in Depp’s favor. She had testified that she fell down a flight of stairs while leaving a hotel in Jamaica during a rainstorm. Depp came running back and carried her to her room, she testified. Depp, now 59, had dated Moss from 1994 to 1997. Moss also described in the wide-ranging interview an incident where she was asked to take her top off by a photographer at a shoot when she was just 15 years old. She said “I could feel there was something wrong, so I got my stuff and I ran away.”
