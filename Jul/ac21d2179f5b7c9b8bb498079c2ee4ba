A Hamptons mansion with a million-dollar outdoor TV has just sold for $30 million, The Post has learned. The seller is developer Yale Fishman of Hamptons Luxury Estates. The new-construction traditional home, at 63 Duck Pond Lane in Southampton, first hit the market last July for $35 million, as The Post exclusively reported at the time. At a massive 16,000 square feet, it comes with nine bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and over-the-top details. The latter, of note, includes that lavish 8-foot-tall, 18-foot-wide TV, which is by a firepit. It’s hydraulic and pops out from the ground — dropping back in if it’s raining, the listing broker, Shawn Elliott of Nest Seekers International, told The Post. There’s also a pool, a sunken tennis court and a 1,200-square-foot pool house. Inside, there’s plenty more to keep people entertained, from an indoor movie theater that seats 12 to a home gym with a Peloton bike and a treadmill, a spa with a steam room and sauna — and an indoor basketball court. After working out, you might want to drop by the 1,100-bottle wine cellar. The smart-wired home also boasts 20-foot ceilings in the foyer and a great room with a marble fireplace. It also features zoned thermostats, radiant-heated floors, a dehumidification system, a solar panel energy system, a backup generator, an ultraviolet/ozone sanitization system and a three-car garage with an electric charging station. Brown Harris Stevens brokers Christopher Burnside and Aubri Peele repped the buyer.
