Is Spidey feeling the inflation crunch? A Florida thief dressed as Spider-Man robbed a woman after she asked to take a picture with the costumed crook outside a laundromat, police said. The Broward County Sheriff’s Office said Lequan Payne, 36, was dressed in the black version of Spidey’s regalia — including the mask — while loitering on a Hollywood street on Monday, Local 10 reported. A tickled laundromat patron took a picture with Payne before resuming her cleaning. The victim, 58, was walking home near the location after finishing her wash when the pseudo-Spidey clubbed her in the head and relieved her of $46, police said. Instructed to be on the lookout for the masked superhero, responding officers soon spotted Payne later that night and arrested him. Video footage of the bust shows Payne gesticulating wildly in the costume in front of flashing police lights. He now faces charges of robbery and resisting an officer, records show.
