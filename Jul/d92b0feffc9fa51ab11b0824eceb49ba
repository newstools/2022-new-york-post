After he was arrested Monday at the Nashville International Airport on charges of public intoxication, former NHL star Bobby Ryan took to Twitter to express gratitude towards those who have wished him well. “I’ve had so many incredible messages today,” Ryan wrote Wednesday morning. “Thank you for all of them. Today is day 1 (again). Mostly embarrassed, but I shouldn’t be. Today I’m waking up and choosing better. “Every now and again you’re reminded exactly why social media exists and today is such a good reason. Thank you guys all from the bottom of my heart. I hate that I’m here, but it’s where I am and I’ll own that.” Ryan, 35, has battled alcohol abuse throughout his NHL career. He missed three months of the 2019-20 season while attending an NHL player assistance program, eventually making a triumphant return by scoring a hat trick in his first home game since taking leave. In September of 2020, Ryan was awarded the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy by the league, an annual honor bestowed upon a player who exemplifies perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication. He is currently a free agent after playing with the Red Wings during the 2020-21 season. At the time of his arrest on Monday, Ryan was “unaware of his location, the day or time and posed a danger to himself,” according to police reports. Security cameras also captured Ryan shoplifting before entering a bar, where he first made contact with officers.
