Rapper Big Sean paid his respects to the 10 victims who died in a hate-fueled mass shooting in Buffalo, NY, on May 14. The “Bounce Back” hitmaker shared a series of images outside Tops Friendly Market on Jefferson Avenue where the senseless attack took place. The shooter — identified by law enforcement as 18-year-old Payton Gendron — drove from “hours away” in Conklin, NY, to a predominantly black neighborhood in Buffalo. Thirteen people in all were shot — 11 black and two white. Taking a moment to reflect, the rapper — who grew up in Detroit, which is about a 4-hour drive from Buffalo — laid flowers down among dozens of other bouquets outside the grocery store. Images of the 10 victims who were gunned down in the attack are displayed at the memorial. “Exactly 2 months after the massacre, Tops is back open, stronger than ever n ready for business,” the rapper wrote on Instagram alongside the images. “Prayers up for da world,” the rapper, who was seen wearing a “Black Lives Matter” T-shirt, added in his post. The six-time Grammy Award-nominated artist, who is expecting his first child with girlfriend Jhené Aiko, later wrote on his Instagram Story, “Felt like the sun was shining right on Tops on a cloudy day.” In another post, he shared an image inside the supermarket where he chatted with store staff.
