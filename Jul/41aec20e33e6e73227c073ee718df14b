This optical illusion might put a spring into your step. In this Easter-themed optical illusion, there is a baby chicken hidden amongst busy bunnies getting ready for their big day. The illusion was first shared by Hungarian artist Gergely Dudas, who usually likes to try and stump visitors to his blog or his books. Each of the 29 rabbits has a partner to help share the work — except one who sticks out like a sore thumb. [Warning: Spoilers Below] According to The Sun, those who can find the lone chick within 30 seconds could call themselves record-holders due to the extreme difficulty of this optical illusion. The brightly-colored trick is enough to easily overstimulate anyone’s brain; however, those who are able to overcome the bright colors and busy landscape might just be able to spot the chicken before the 30 seconds are up. After a second glance, or perhaps a much longer time limit, viewers will be able to see the chicken hiding on the left-hand side of the image near the top of a hard-working rabbit’s ear. This is not the first time that Dudas has stumped several people. Earlier this week, the artist released an illusion asking people to find the snake among the sea turtles within 15 seconds. According to several scientists, optical illusions such as these are good for the brain. Professionals have said that illusions are a diversion from the stresses of modern life while also helping to map the complexities of the human mind and how it reacts to its surroundings.
