It’s 2022, and if a brand isn’t inclusive yet — well, they’ve surely missed the mark. As Lizzo may say, it’s about damn time plus-sized clothing is more accessible, especially online.

Thankfully, many DTC companies are following suit, including Girlfriend Collective and Kim-K-owned SKIMS. Those fire cocktail dresses and curve-loving women’s jeans are easier to grab than ever (though we’re still a ways to go in the inclusivity department). That’s why we corralled the 32 best plus-sized brands to shop for online. Think of this as your detailed, specially curated guide to add the clothes you pinned on Pinterest into your closet for real.
