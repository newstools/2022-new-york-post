Oregon Ducks tight end Spencer Webb was killed in a diving accident less than a mile from Eugene, where the university is located, according to The Sacramento Bee. The 22-year-old — who is a native of Sacramento — reportedly died after hitting his head during a cliff-diving accident just west of Triangle Lake in Lane County. Webb was entering his fifth-year junior season this fall and was projected to be a starter. The Lane County Sheriff’s Office released a statement Wednesday on Facebook that said authorities “responded to the rock slides just a short distance west of Triangle Lake at approximately 2:30 pm after receiving the report of an injured person. “Upon arrival, deputies learned that a 22 year old male recreating in the area fell and struck his head. Bystanders and responding paramedics were unable to revive him. Lane County Sheriff Search and Rescue personnel responded to assist with bringing him back to the roadway as he was approximately 100 yards down a steep trail,” the statement continued. “There is no evidence of foul play and his death appears to be accidental. The victim’s name is being withheld at this time pending next of kin notification.” A cause of death has not been announced or confirmed as of Thursday morning — in which multiple Oregon coaches and players acknowledged the news on social media. “So full of life in every moment of the day,” Oregon football coach Dan Lanning tweeted. “Your smile and energy will be missed Spencer. I love you!” The team has yet to release a statement as of Thursday morning. Webb had 31 catches for 296 yards and four touchdowns over 29 games with the Ducks — recording 13 catches for 87 yards and a touchdown in 2021. He played at Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento.
