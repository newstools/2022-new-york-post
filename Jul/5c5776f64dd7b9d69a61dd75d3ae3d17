A lot of Yankees fans can probably relate to this reaction of Joey Gallo’s at bat on Tuesday night. In the Yankees’ 6-3 loss to the Mets in the opener of the Subway Series, the Bombers trailed 5-3 in the eighth inning. With two outs and and Aaron Hicks on first, Isiah Kiner-Falefa was set to hit against Adam Ottavino before being pulled back to the dugout. As they announced the change, the Mets made a change of their own by bringing in Edwin Diaz to face Gallo. It’s safe to say it wasn’t a fair matchup, as Diaz quickly dispatched him, and the move was less than popular – especially with this fan. Warning: graphic language Yankees manager Aaron Boone defended the move by saying Gallo’s power gave him a better chance of an extra-base hit than Kiner-Falefa with the Bombers down two runs, and it would force the Mets to go to Diaz for a four-out save. It is still baffling that Gallo continues to get consistent at bats with the pace he is on. The former All-Star is now batting .161 and has struck out 103 times in 230 at bats. He is also making $10 million dollars in 2022 to put up those numbers. With the trade deadline approaching, his time with the Yankees or getting consistent at bats for them is likely coming to an end.
