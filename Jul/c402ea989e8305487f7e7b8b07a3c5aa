A Memphis man is accused of killing his newlywed wife while on their Fiji honeymoon following a “whirlwind romance,” according to reports. Bradley Robert Dawson was charged with murder after Christe Chen was found dead at a scenic Fiji resort in the Yasawa Islands, according to Fox 13. An attorney for Dawson told the news station he could not confirm how his 36-year-old bride died, but that her body was discovered in a hotel room. The lawyer also said his 38-year-old client has maintained he is innocent of the murder rap. The Fiji Sun reported authorities requested a judge order Dawson to submit a DNA sample after the defendant refused the forensics tests following the July 9 slaying. Magistrate Sekonaia Vodokisolomone said the DNA request, as well as a bail application, would need to be made in the High Court in Lautoka after the case was transferred during the hearing, the paper said. One neighbor of the couple told Fox 13 that Chen was elated about the trip to Fiji days before they departed from the new home the two had moved into in Memphis. Chen was a pharmacist at Kroger and a graduate of the University of Tennessee. Her LinkedIn profile also indicated she was the owner and pastry chef at a business called Sweet As Pie Bakery in Denver, Colorado until 2017. Dawson works in the IT department at a non-profit that helps children but has since been suspended. “He has been suspended pending further information. It is our understanding Ms. Chen was his wife, and our condolences go out to her family,” Youth Villages told FOX13. The couple wed in February, according to the Daily Beast. One acquaintance, who knew Chen professionally, told the Daily Beast, “It was some kind of whirlwind romance” and few who knew Dawson met him before they got hitched.
