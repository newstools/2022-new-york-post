With the Mickey Mantle rookie card expected to fetch $10 million and Buzz Aldrin’s astronaut suit to go for $2.8 million, Stitches spent the day looking for treasures in the attic. No Mantle, but I did find a 1968 Horace Clarke and the suit I wore for my high school graduation. Any takers? Anyone? It’s been a while since we last checked in with Yu Darvish (9-4, 3.28 ERA). Darvish has won his last two starts. Limited the Mets’ potent lineup to one run over seven strong at Citi Field and has allowed only five runs over his last 21 innings. The Padres visit Detroit. Tarik Skubal (7-8, 3.88) is coming off his best start of the season. Shutout the A’s for six innings, fanning nine. Nevertheless, Skubal was pounded for 25 runs over his previous 31 innings and the Padres aren’t the A’s. Are Yu kidding? 10 units on San Diego.  Amazin! First-inning fireworks. Yanks scored twice in the top half. Mets responded, scoring four in the bottom half, and went on to win 6-3. Up +1,955 tomterrifics.
