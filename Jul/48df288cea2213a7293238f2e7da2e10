US Marshals are searching for an “armed and dangerous” man accused of shooting Lady Gaga’s dog walker last year, only to be mistakenly let out of a Los Angeles jail three months ago. Fugitive James Howard Jackson, 19, has been on the lam since April 6 when a clerical error showed the charges against him had been dropped in connection to the shooting of Ryan Fischer in a bizarre scheme to kidnap Lady Gaga’s three French bulldogs. The US Marshals Service announced Monday it was offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to Jackson’s arrest after the agency was asked to get involved by the LA County Sheriff’s Department. “Jackson should be considered armed and dangerous,” the service said in a news release. “Anyone with information as to his whereabouts should contact law enforcement immediately.” Jackson was one of three men who allegedly shot and robbed Fischer as he walked the three bulldogs on Feb. 24, 2021. The three men made off with two of the dogs — Koji and Gustav — which an accomplice then tried to return for a $500,000 reward, claiming she had found the kidnapped canines. In April 2021, Jackson, Jaylin White, 19, and Lafayette White, 27, were arrested and slapped with charges of attempted murder, conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery in the crime. Two others were charged as accessories after the fact: Harold White and Jennifer McBride, who acted as the person who found the dogs. Fischer, who was blasted in the chest and suffered a collapsed lung, had said he was “deeply concerned” about Jackson’s erroneous release in an Instagram post but called for the fugitive to turn himself in. The clerical error arose when Jackson’s charges were to have been replaced by a superseding grand jury indictment that was never entered into the system, reports said.
