Being a bridesmaid is an honor and responsibility, but one woman is worried she may steal the show for the wrong reasons. A UK woman, who goes by pilyplum on TikTok,  created quite a stir on the app after trying on the dress for her best friend’s wedding — with the low-cut top leaving her almost fully exposed due to her 34GG breasts. “The length of time I’ll be in the wedding pics for,” the TikToker quipped in a 5-second clip, showing off the cornflower blue dress that has a scooped neckline and puffed sleeves. In a previous video, she had revealed her best friend’s fiancé had picked the dresses and obviously hadn’t considered how it would fit on her. TikTok users were quick to comment with suggestions to help cover up, including wearing a camisole, vest or a mesh top underneath. “Get it altered. Take some fabric from the hem and add to the bust,” one TikToker suggested. “White lace bandeau,” another woman suggested, who says she has HH sized boobs. However, the video also came with comments from users accusing her of being “attention seeking,” and questioning whether or not the dress was legitimately for her best friend’s wedding. “Just an other [sic] opportunity to expose,” one user commented, while another declared it “too casual” for a bridesmaid’s dress.
