Tropical Storm Colin has formed overnight off the South Carolina coast. It’s currently located about 5 miles west of Myrtle Beach with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. The storm is moving northeast at 7 mph. This general motion is expected to continue through Sunday. A turn toward the east-northeast with an increase in forwarding speed is expected late Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Colin is expected to move northeastward along or just inland of the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts through Sunday, and then over the western Atlantic Ocean late Sunday. The storm may wobble on- and offshore since it’s been hugging the coastline so tightly. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect from South Santee River, South Carolina, to Duck, North Carolina, and Pamlico Sound. The warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours. The area has already seen several inches of rain, so forecasters warn any additional precipitation could cause flash flooding. Tropical moisture along the coast of the Southeast will not only produce flooding rains over the weekend but also increase the chances of seeing waterspouts as beachgoers did on Friday afternoon near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. More widely scattered storms are expected to remain in the forecast after the low-pressure system moves northeastward away from the region. The continued chance for showers and storms means some holiday goers will have to dodge raindrops through Independence Day.
