A 38-year-old woman was viciously robbed by two female suspects in Soho last week, cops said Monday. The victim was standing on Broadway near Spring Street just before 5 a.m. Tuesday when two other women approached and asked her for the time, authorities said. The duo snatched the woman’s iPhone 11 from her hand and demanded her password, but the victim refused, police said. In turn, the pair punched the woman in the face, causing her to fall to the ground, cops said. They continued punching and kicking the victim before dropping the phone and grabbing her backpack — holding personal items and $40 — before fleeing, police said. The victim sustained bruising and pain, but refused medical attention, cops said. One of the suspects is described as a woman with a dark complexion and thin build, about 5 feet 6 with long, dark hair. She was last seen wearing shorts, white Nike Jordan sneakers and a multi-colored tank top. The other woman also had a dark complexion and thin build, about 5 feet 6 with long, braided dark hair. She was last seen wearing black pants, black sneakers and a multi-colored jacket with a black camisole top.
