Apple has ended a consulting deal with former design chief Jony Ive, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Citing sources, the newspaper reported that Ive’s contract had come up for renewal and the parties agreed not to extend it. Ive, who left Apple in 2019, was a close confidant of the late Chief Executive Steve Jobs and spearheaded design work on the company’s candy-colored Mac computers and the iPhone. Apple declined to comment on the report. After departing Apple, Ive remained a consultant for Apple and also formed a company called LoveFrom. Among other clients, LoveFrom is working with Exor, the owner of Ferrari, under a multiyear agreement to “explore a range of creative projects with Exor in the business of luxury.” Born and raised outside London, the 55-year-old Ive joined Apple in 1992 and rose to lead its design team. The company was on the brink of bankruptcy in 1997 when Steve Jobs tasked Mr. Ive’s team with designing the iMac. The bulbous, translucent computer became, at the time, the fastest-selling desktop in history. The Times noted that Ive helped define every rounded corner of an iPhone and guided development of its only new product category in recent years, the Apple Watch. Ive also developed the iPod’s white earbuds, which inspired Apple’s dancing silhouette advertising campaign, and he supported the creation of the iPhone’s touch-screen technology, according to the report.
