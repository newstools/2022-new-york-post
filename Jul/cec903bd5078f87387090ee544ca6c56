Rush Limbaugh’s widow is looking to unload his sprawling longtime Palm Beach home for a record-setting price. The 2.7-acre waterfront compound, owned by a trust tied to the talk show host’s widow Kathryn Adams, is being quietly shopped for $150 million to $175 million, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Located on exclusive North Ocean Boulevard, the property reportedly boasts 250 feet of ocean beach access and features multiple structures, including a flamboyant 24,000-square-foot house. The right-wing media stalwart paid less than $4 million for the estate in 1998, according to the newspaper. He died last year of lung cancer at age 70. The main house had a salon invoking Versailles and a replica chandelier from Manhattan’s Plaza Hotel,  Ze’ev Chafet reportedly wrote in his Limbaugh biography “An Army of One.” A guest suite was fashioned after the presidential suite in Paris’ Hotel George V and the library was reportedly a scaled-down version of the one at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina. Real estate agents said the specificity of the home’s architecture might attract buyers who would tear it down and rebuild, according to the article. The priciest home ever sold in Florida was for $173 million in nearby Manalapan last month.
