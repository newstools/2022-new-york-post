Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said Sunday that the band is postponing its European tour after he received “very unexpected” health news. The 51-year-old rapper said in a video to fans on the band’s website that his physical condition was healthy ahead of the “Still Sucks” tour dates, but after giving him tests, his doctor reportedly told him that “he would not like me to tour at this time, and to stay close by to do more tests.” The somber Durst did not elaborate on what kind of health scare he was facing. “I’m only wishing for the best and I know everything’s going to be OK,” he declared. Durst also promised that he already has something in the works to “make it up” to fans across the pond. “We truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our loyal fans, promoters and support staff. Stand by for further news,” the band wrote in a statement on its website. A similar message was also released on Instagram. The rap-rock band has been on tour since April, played at Lollapalooza 2021 and released its sixth album, “Still Sucks,” in October 2021, but postponed the tour until this year due to COVID-19 concerns.
