She redefined pushing others to succeed in an educational setting. Now-viral footage captures the appalling moment a cheating U.K. mother shoved a rival mom to the ground to win a competition at her daughter’s school. “I told my daughter I would be number one, so I had to be!” Katie McDermott, 25, told SWNS of  the incident, which occurred while she was racing against other parents and kids during the school’s sports day in Coventry. Needless to say, the hypercompetitive parent was willing to do anything to get ahead. The clip starts off innocently enough with moms and kids sprinting back and forth on a grass track. However, the mom-petition takes a turn during the final stretch, whereupon the red haired McDermott can be seen trailing another mother by a few paces. Realizing she’s about to lose, the pushy parent gives her rival a shove, sending her toppling face first onto the field. “I could see she was winning – so I just gave her a quick nudge and she took off in the air,” McDermott described. “I don’t know what possessed me to do it, I was just thinking about how I wanted to win so badly!” The competitor said the moment was particularly awkward as she “didn’t know the mum very well.” Fortunately, while everyone was “shocked” at the time, McDermott said “they carried on as normal afterwards.” She has since apologized for resorting to the dirty tactic. “If you see this, sorry that I pushed you – I didn’t mean to send you flying!” said McDermott, before cheekily adding, “I don’t regret it though, because I won!” In a more serious case of parental violence in February, a Texas mom was charged with assaulting several children and a ref at a middle school basketball game.
