Dozens of rotting bodies were found at an Indiana funeral home, prompting a police investigation, according to multiple local reports. Cops in Jeffersonville found 31 bodies at Lankford Funeral Home, “some of which were in the advanced stages of decomposition, said Maj. Isaac Parker in a statement, the Louisville Courier Journal reported. Cops also found post-cremation remains of 16 people, according to the outlet. An air conditioning unit at the funeral home stopped working, and police do not currently suspect criminal wrongdoing in the incident, local TV station WDRB reported Friday. The owner of the funeral home “got behind on processing bodies,” WDRB reported Saturday, citing an unnamed source. Though Parker noted nobody has been charged with a crime, Jeffersonville Police, the Clark County Sheriff’s Department and Indiana State Police are investigating the matter, the station reported. “We’re working with the Clark County Prosecutor’s Office to ensure that the investigation is efficient and successful,” Parker said, according to the news outlet.
