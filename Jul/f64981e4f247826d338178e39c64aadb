Actress and comedian Mo’Nique and Netflix have made amends — and now she will get her own comedy special. The Oscar-winning entertainer, 54, announced the collaboration in a video message posted Tuesday on Netflix’s Twitter account. “Can y’all believe this s–t?” the “Precious” star joked — twice — before delivering the good news. “I’m excited to say that I’ll be shooting my first Netflix special, in addition to reuniting with my friend, director Lee Daniels on the Netflix film ‘The Deliverance,’” she said with a smile. “You won’t want to miss either of them, so stay tuned,” the Grammy-nominee continued. “Thank you all and I love y’all to life,” Mo’Nique added. Her comedy special is set to be filmed in Atlanta in August. Her new project with Daniels, meanwhile, comes just three months after the filmmaker and the actress — who won an Oscar working with Daniels on the 2009 movie “Precious” — made up following a years-long feud. “I am so sorry for hurting you in any way that I did,” Daniels said to the comedian during an event in New York City in early April. Mo’Nique had previously criticized Daniels because she felt she had been “blackballed” in Hollywood after she decided not to “campaign” for honors before the 2010 awards season. The projects come a month after Mo’Nique and Netflix settled a race and sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the comedian in 2019. She alleged that the streaming giant broke the law by giving her a “lowball” offer of $500,000 for a 2018 comedy special. Comparatively, Amy Schumer was offered $11 million and Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock were both offered $20 million for their specials. Mo’Nique has an array of awards to her credit, including an Oscar, a Grammy and four NAACP Image Awards. She was also nominated for an Emmy in 2015 for her performance in HBO’s “Bessie.”
