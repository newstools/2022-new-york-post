Jimmy Butler nearly broke the internet with his new hairstyle. On Wednesday, the Miami Heat star took to Instagram to reveal his longer ‘do, which features long  dreadlocks with some lighter coloring at the ends — and some fans couldn’t believe the  drastic hair transformation. Butler — who previously sported short cornrow braids earlier this month — debuted his new look in a video that showed the evolution of his longer locks. It appears as though Butler got hair extensions. Some fans noted his hair was much shorter in recent weeks. NBA skills coach Chris Brickley was first to share photos of Butler’s new look on Wednesday, during a workout at the new Bridgehampton Killer Bees basketball court in Long Island. It’s unclear if Butler’s new hairstyle is here to stay for his upcoming 12th NBA season — or if he switched up his hair for his offseason travels. The six-time All-Star boarded a private plane to Bogota, Colombia on Wednesday, and rocked a top knot while aboard the plane in photos he shared to his Instagram story. Butler led the No. 1-seeded Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals last season while averaging 27.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 2.1 steals per game in the postseason. The Heat reportedly plan to run it back with their same roster, but have also emerged in the pursuit for Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell.
