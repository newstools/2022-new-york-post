A Texas police officer was recovering on Sunday after being shot in the face and rushed to the hospital in the back of a police cruiser by fellow officers. Missouri City cop Crystal Sepulveda, a three-year member of the department, was carried into a Houston-area hospital by several officers after they arrived with the injured officer in the back of the police vehicle, footage captured by Fox 26 Houston shows. Officials said the 29-year-old officer was expected to survive and was listed in stable condition surrounded by family and friends “She is a strong officer, she will make it through this,” said Lance Bothell, Missouri City assistant police chief. Sepulveda was shot twice, including once in the face, early Saturday morning while she and other officers tracked down the driver of a car that was stolen in an aggravated robbery the previous day, Houston police said. The suspect eventually fled the car he was in and was pursued by officers on foot, according to authorities. A shootout ensued, which is when Sepulveda was struck with two gunshots, said Houston police chief Troy Finner during a press conference. Multiple law enforcement agencies responded and set up a perimeter in search of the suspect, who has not been identified by authorities yet. Once the suspect was located, another shootout erupted and the alleged gunman was shot multiple times and later pronounced dead at the hospital. “He was armed with two automatic pistols with extended magazines,” Finner said. “That’s what we’re facing and everybody needs to know it.” Fox 26 spoke to the homeowner where the shooting broke out. She’s thankful Sepulveda survived and no one else was hurt. “Bullets didn’t go in the house. Bullets could have gone in the house. The car could have came through the window, so I feel much better to know God protected my son that was here last night,” Carolyn Smith the television station. A fundraiser for Sepulveda has raised nearly $18,000 Sunday night.
