Las Vegas is considering imposing a curfew for people under 21 years old after a number of recent shootings in the downtown area. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said on Tuesday that she and other city officials are exploring the possibility of such a curfew after gunmen opened fire in a popular tourist area in two separate instances in less than a month. She made the announcement a day after a man shot and injured another man right outside the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Vegas early Monday morning, according to Fox5. “[The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department] and our city marshals have committed to an increase law enforcement presence,” Goodman tweeted the next morning. “Our City Attorney will prosecute violators to the fullest, and we’re exploring a curfew for those under 21.” The ages of the men involved in the Independence Day shooting haven’t been released and the suspect remains at large. However the gunman in the earlier shooting is just 16 years old. The teen allegedly shot and killed a 23-year-old man and injured a bystander at the Fremont Street Experience on June 19, Fox5 reported. Las Vegas already has a curfew of 10 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends for those under 18 years old.
