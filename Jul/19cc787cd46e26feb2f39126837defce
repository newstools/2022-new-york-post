Mexico City police announced the single-biggest cocaine bust in the capital’s history, seizing 1.6 tons of the drug from two freight trucks. Police chief Omar Garcia Harfuch said Tuesday the confiscated cocaine had a street value of about $20 million in Mexico. But Mexico City’s top cop said only part of the shipment had been destined for the capital, with the rest heading north across the US border to Los Angeles. The cocaine apparently was sent to Mexico from Colombia and landed at a port on the Pacific coast of the southern state of Oaxaca, the chief said. In an interview with the local radio station Radio Formula, Harfuch revealed that the drug bust followed an earlier investigation that gave the cops advance knowledge that the cocaine cargo was coming in the two tractor-trailers. The Mexican newspaper El Pais reported that the drugs were stashed in secret compartments inside the trucks. He said a third vehicle was escorting the two trucks, and four Colombians were arrested in connection with the seizure — three of them with prior criminal records. Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the head of government of Mexico City, called the cocaine bust “historic.” “It’s an example that in Mexico City there is no impunity or complicity,” she wrote in a statement posted on her Facebook page on Tuesday. Mexico City officials have long acknowledged that drug cartels use the capital as a shipping point, but they claim the gangs do not operate in the city as brazenly as they do in other parts of Mexico.
