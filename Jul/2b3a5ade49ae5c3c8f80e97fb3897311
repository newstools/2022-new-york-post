James Harden is back in Philadelphia – for far less money, that is. The free agent shooting guard and 76ers have agreed to a two-year deal worth $68.6 million, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. The deal includes a player option for the second year that allows Harden to hit the free agent market if he so chooses. Harden’s agreement comes less than a month after the 32-year-old declined his $47.4 million player option for the 2022-23 season, instead opting to return to Philadelphia on a restructured free agent contract. The selfless move, which sees the superstar’s annual salary drop more than $13 million to $34 million, provided the 76ers with financial flexibility they could use to fill the holes in their lineup. “I had conversations with [team president] Daryl [Morey], and it was explained how we could get better and what the market value was for certain players. I told Daryl to improve the roster, sign who we needed to sign and give me whatever is left over,” Harden recently told Yahoo Sports. “This is how bad I want to win. I want to compete for a championship. That’s all that matters to me at this stage. I’m willing to take less to put us in position to accomplish that.” Morey did just that, signing defensive specialist P.J. Tucker for three years, $33 million, sharp shooter Danuel House for two years and $8.5 million and last year’s G League MVP Trevelin Queen. The Sixers additionally acquired guard De’Anthony Melton from the Memphis Grizzlies via trade. Harden joined the 76ers after being dealt by the Brooklyn Nets just hours before last season’s trade deadline. Now, it seems as though he’s committed to sticking with them for at least one more season.
