Perhaps Steph Curry should stick to basketball. Curry and his wife Ayesha took the field at Oakland Coliseum before the Athletics-Astros game on Wednesday to throw out the ceremonial first pitches. While the couple’s appearance was for a good cause — to promote the Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation — the same cannot be said for the quality of their pitches. Ayesha first pitched to the wrong catcher, as her high-arcing throw landed several feet in front of the Athletics staff member who was awaiting Steph’s toss. Her husband didn’t fare much better, with the Golden State Warriors point guard throwing a fastball nearly a yard out of the strike zone. Juan Toscano-Anderson, Curry’s former teammate, was quick to wail on the 34-year-old, tweeting, “I never wanna hear you say a word again about my first pitch,” alongside several crying laughing emojis. Not long after the poor performance, Curry visited the A’s broadcast team, where he attributed the erratic toss to his friends teasing him beforehand. Although the pitch’s accuracy left much to be desired, the four-time NBA champion accomplished his goal “to throw some heat.” Curry fared far better in the batters box than on the mound, launching several balls into the outfield while taking batting practice before the game. Oakland went on to beat Houston 4-2 to complete a three-game sweep.
