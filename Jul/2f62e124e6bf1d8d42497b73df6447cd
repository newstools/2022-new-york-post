Count Shark Week and the Chiefs among Gracie Hunt’s favorite things. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, the daughter of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt showed her support for the team in a black and red bikini, all the while hyping up Discovery Channel’s week-long event in the post’s caption. “Chiefs training camp [right arrow] meets #Sharkweek,” Hunt wrote. “Very appropriate since we have our own shark. #55,” she continued, giving a shoutout to Chiefs defensive end Frank “The Shark” Clark. Though Hunt, 23, is clearly enjoying Shark Week, which wraps Saturday, she’s also readying for the Chiefs’ upcoming season as the team reported to training camp this week. Kansas City fell short of a Super Bowl appearance last season after losing to the Cincinnati Bengals in January’s AFC Championship game. Once the game concluded, Hunt shared a heartfelt message to Chiefs Kingdom, thanking the fans for their support. “Our 2021 season is over, but the future is always full of hope and expectation. Thank you to each and every fan for pouring your heart, soul, and prayers into this team. Chiefs Kingdom wouldn’t be what it is without you,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. Despite the defeat in January, Hunt had plenty to celebrate in April when her beloved Jayhawks won the national championship against the North Carolina Tar Heels. The University of Kansas alum — who represented the state in last year’s Miss USA pageant — was joined by her parents in New Orleans for the game. With the 2022 NFL season just around the corner, expect Hunt to be cheering on the Chiefs in Week 1, when they visit the Cardinals in Arizona.
