The NFL season returns on September 9, with the Buffalo Bills taking on Los Angeles Rams. Ahead of the season, The Post takes you through each teams’ Win Totals, and which teams are expected to be the best in the league for the new campaign.    The 2022 NFL season will be the first full season in which bettors in New York will be able to wager on every game. For those of you new to Win Totals betting, here’s a little breakdown of how it works. A total number of wins is set by the oddsmaker, and bettors are given a choice of whether that team will go Over or Under that number of wins. Using the New York Giants current line of seven as an example, should they win eight or more games, the over would pay out. If the Giants manage only six wins or less, the under would hit. In the case that the Giants finish the season on exactly seven wins, the wager would be a push and your stake would be returned. In the case of teams such as the Rams where their win total line is set at 10.5, with half a win, there is no chance of a push, as the Rams will either go over or under 10.5 wins. In order for the over to hit, they must win 11 games, and if they won just 10 games or less, the under would be the winning bet.
