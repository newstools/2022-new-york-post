For a minor league player, it’s always exciting when a major leaguer comes down for a rehab assignment. It’s even more exciting when that major leaguer is future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer. After making his second and final start in Binghamton with the Rumble Ponies, Scherzer made sure the prospects had more than his pitching to remember as the Mets ace, 37, treated his teammates to a feast of filet mignon, lobster and more, according to Fox Sports. Scherzer, who agreed to a three-year, $130 million deal with the Mets in 2021, is said to have shelled out a few thousand dollars for the multi-table locker room buffet, keeping up with the tradition of treating to a pre- or post-game spread. “They’re eating well tonight,” Scherzer said Wednesday of the feast, which was said to be “upward of $7,000,” per the report. Dinner wasn’t the end of Scherzer’s generosity, however. The three-time Cy Young Award winner also bought AirPods for the entire squad, according to a Fox Sports source. Scherzer is known for being a fierce competitor on the field, but he is also a great teammate and clubhouse guy. He notably was the MLBPA’s figurehead during the MLB lockout. Scherzer was initially added to the Mets’ injured list in May.
