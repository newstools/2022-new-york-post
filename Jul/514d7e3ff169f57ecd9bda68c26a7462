A North Carolina man was arrested after stealing an ambulance with the keys still in it from a restaurant parking lot and leading cops on a wild chase, authorities said. Winston-Salem police say Ervin D. Alexander, 37, heisted the Catawba County ambulance Friday morning around 11:16 am, the Winston-Salem Journal reported. The ambulance was left running because there were refrigerated drugs inside the vehicle. Police said Alexander climbed into the vehicle’s driver’s seat and took off. Two county emergency medical technicians who were responsible for the vehicle were having breakfast inside a nearby eatery and didn’t realize it was stolen until they finished their food and headed back outside. Patrol Sgt. S.D. Martin said the ambulance headed west on Interstate 40 into Iredell County. He said troopers got behind the ambulance approximately 40 miles west of Winston-Salem and tried stopping it. The chase continued for three miles until Iredell County deputies used tire-deflating devices to bring the vehicle to a screeching halt. Alexander, of Winston-Salem, was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, fleeing to elude arrest and resisting a public officer. His bond was set at $125,000. With Post wires.
