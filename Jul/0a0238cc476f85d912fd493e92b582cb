The Sixers might be on the hot seat for tampering after acquiring P.J. Tucker from the Heat, according to Marc Stein’s substack. After Philadelphia signed the veteran forward to a three-year, $33 million deal, questions began to pop up about the Sixers getting the deal done so quickly. Tucker’s agent Andre Buck announced the new contract just minutes into this off-season’s free agency period. Tucker, a 37-year-old veteran who has hopped between contenders for the last five seasons, was already linked to Philadelphia because of his ties with both James Harden and Daryl Morey. The forward was previously associated with the two during his time on the Rockets. Morey, the current Sixers president, has a track record of tampering – mainly because of ill-advised posts on social media. Despite his age, Tucker is extremely durable, playing 89 games mainly as a starter for Miami this past season. The 2021 NBA Champion has a career average of 7.1 points per game, while shooting 42.5 percent from behind the arc.
