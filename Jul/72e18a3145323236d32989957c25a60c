The Connecticut mom who was found dead at home this week along with her three kids had strangled the children before taking her own life, police said Thursday. Sonia Loja, 36, was identified by Danbury police as the woman found dead from suspected asphyxia by hanging at a single-family home on Whaley Street, where cops responded for a wellbeing check at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday. Loja’s three children, identified as 12-year-old Junior Panjon, 10-year-old Joselyn Panjon and 5-year-old Jonael Panjon, were also found dead in the residence. “Pending an official autopsy, preliminary findings indicate that Ms. Loja strangled her three children before killing herself,” Danbury police said in a statement to The Post. “However, this is still an active investigation.” Loja and her three kids lived at the home with two other adults who weren’t there when cops arrived Wednesday. They have since been advised of the four deaths, police said. Autopsies were set to be conducted Thursday morning. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victims,” department officials said in a statement. Mayor Dean Esposito characterized the incident as a “truly horrible event” that rocked the Connecticut city. “In the coming days, mental health and counseling services will be provided through collaboration with the Danbury Public Schools and the City of Danbury,” Esposito said in a statement. “Our community grieves for the innocent lives taken from us. We will get through this together.” If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the five boroughs, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.
