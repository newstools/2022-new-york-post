An investigation has been launched over a woman killed by alligators on a Florida golf course. The elderly woman, according to officials, reportedly lived near the course and was seen falling into a pond at the Boca Royale Golf and Country Club. The woman reportedly struggled to get out of the pond before alligators attacked her and pulled her underneath the water’s surface. The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office and the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have vowed to capture the alligators responsible for the woman’s death as the investigation continues. The woman’s identity has not yet been divulged. Alligators have been found in increasingly unlikely places across the United States this year. An alligator was recently found swimming in a rather unlikely place: a lake in Wisconsin. On Wednesday, J&R Aquatic Animal Rescue, based in Menasha, Wisconsin, posted about the 18-24-inch American alligator on Facebook. The small gator was found in Long Lake in Fond du Lac and Sheboygan Counties, according to the Facebook post. Last month, officers with the Midland County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call about a small American alligator that was found under a car in an RV park. Midland County is in the middle of the West Texas desert – not anywhere near where alligators are usually found.
