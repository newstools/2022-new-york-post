Tony Shalhoub, the stage and screen actor who stars as the title character’s father on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” has dropped the price of his Upper West Side digs from $4.49 million in April to $4.35 million. Shalhoub bought the “classic five” layout — in a prewar Emery Roth-designed building at 15 W. 81st St. — with his wife, actor/artist Brooke Adams, for $3.99 million in 2016, according to property records. The 12th-floor co-op is a roomy 1,850 square feet and comes with two bedrooms, 2½ baths and lots of light, all near the Museum of Natural History and Central Park. Shalhoub and Adams restored original details, including crown and base moldings — and Roth-designed doorknobs, ceramic wall tiles, mosaic floors in the bathrooms and herringbone-patterned oak floors. The home opens to a gallery that leads to a large living room, with French doors that open to a landscaped, irrigated 60-foot terrace, with original iron railings. The residence also features lots of storage space and a windowed kitchen, plus a butler’s pantry with restored St. Charles stainless steel and glass cabinetry that Roth chose himself. A washer/dryer is also located in the pantry. Building amenities include a gym, a bike room and a children’s playroom. The listing broker is James Foreman, of Brown Harris Stevens.
