A gym, swimming pools, and even a cinema. They’re just some of the things you might expect to find on a cruise ship. But one woman who used to work on one of the vessels has revealed there are also some rooms that you might not know about — including a morgue and a jail. Australian Lauren shares secrets of her former life as a cruise ship employee on her TikTok page, and recently posted a video explaining “creepy cruise ship secrets”. “There’s some crazy stuff about cruise ships that you might not know about as a guest,” she began. “It’s kind of creepy — so there’s a morgue on board, there’s a jail on board. “When we worked on a cruise ship we actually saw a dead body getting wheeled out of the morgue. “Obviously they had a cover over it but that in itself is so creepy.” She added the situation was “so confronting” and made her “not want to work on a cruise ship anymore”. “And then they also have a jail cell, so if anyone’s doing anything wrong, they’ll just lock them in there,” she said. Lauren also revealed another thing that made her nervous about working on a cruise ship was the fact that her Carnival cruise ship didn’t have a deck 13. “Carnival does not have a deck 13 because it’s a superstitious thing,” she continued. “Sorry but that’s f**king weird. Like, we’re on a cruise ship and you’re making me feel like superstition comes into play?” “Idk just me I thought if someone died on board they would throw them off,” one person commented on the video. “Death is everywhere and inevitable,” another added. “It’s better to have a place to process grandma Ruth who had a heart attack at sea rather than having to go to land.” “If you’re scared of superstitions and the number 13 don’t come to Canada — we don’t have a 13th floor in any apartment building,” a third wrote. While someone else commented: “Most hospitals don’t have an operating theatre number 13 either it’s missed out.” This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.
