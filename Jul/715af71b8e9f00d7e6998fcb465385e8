A woman was forced into her Brooklyn apartment at gunpoint, sexually assaulted and robbed in a terrifying incident earlier this week, cops said. The 47-year-old victim was in the hallway of her building at Ocean Parkway and Avenue P in Midwood around 8:45 p.m. Monday when two men approached and forced her inside her apartment at gunpoint, authorities said. Once inside, one of the suspects sexually assaulted her, police said. At some point, a third suspect barged in and the trio raided her apartment, cops said. They snatched up about $2,000 in cash, jewelry worth more than $5,000, an iPad, a cell phone, multiple credit cards and medications, police said. Cops released surveillance footage of the suspects and are still looking to track them down.
