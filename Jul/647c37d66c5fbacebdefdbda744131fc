Take note — these beauty secrets are time-tested. Beauty influencer Brittany Allyn attracted more than 370,000 viewers on TikTok after revealing her aunt’s simple skincare tricks that help the 70-year-old look years younger. “Simple but it works?!,” Allyn captioned the TikTok. “First, I never stretch my skin. Think of old leather shoes — how they stretch. Your skin will too, it’s like leather,” she told Allyn’s 254,000 followers in the video. “Always dab it with a towel, don’t use make-up wipes to wipe off your make-up,” she continues. The beauty of a certain age also suggests minimizing your routine. “Number two, I only wash my face at night. I use my fingertips very gently and splash water on and then dab it with a towel,” she says. In text over the clip, Allyn explained that “over-washing strips your natural oils from your skin, which are key to preventing wrinkles.” Her final tip is to use a retinol product. “I dab it on my eyes, I do my forehead, my cheeks, my neck, and my chest,” she says while tapping her face. “I’ll do it a second time and, if I think I need it, a third time. On my mouth and eyes.” Allyn’s followers called the woman “stunning.” “So many great tips!” said one. “Don’t stretch skin is soooo important!! Also, don’t touch under eye area because it’s so thin!” agreed another. But some couldn’t believe the simple tips –so much so that some accused the aunt of getting a boost with Botox. “Face lift Botox fillers. Nothing wrong with that but it’s not the retinol,” said one critic. Allyn later commented beneath her video to clarify the rumors. “Hey all! This was supposed to be a fun video w/ her top non-surgery tips. She does get Botox/fillers too to be transparent! Her tips are helpful 2! ,” she wrote.
