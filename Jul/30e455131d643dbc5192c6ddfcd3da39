When purchasing a new home, it’s important to make sure you’ve checked out every part of the house — which one potential buyer may have taken a bit too seriously. TikTok user @fortdefiance had a viewing for her home but noticed some things askew afterward when she returned to the abode. In a video, which has been viewed over 204,000 times, the user reportedly showed the aftermath of a home viewing, including a noticeably filthy — and clearly used — tub. “So I just got back to my house after showing and [I’m] walking around turning off lights and stuff walking to the bathroom and I was like, ‘Huh. There’s water on the floor — like, I know I just cleaned that,'” the user recounted in the clip. She added that she “painstakingly scrubbed and vacuumed” the bathtub for almost half an hour before the viewing. The perplexed home owner added she’s “pretty sure” someone got on her bed, pointing to a long bench at the end of the bed which had been separated from the frame, adding she thinks they had also tested the second and third bedrooms. “Hope you guys had fun!” she laughed at the end, unperturbed. TikTok users couldn’t believe how comfortable the possible new owners apparently made themselves. “I bet they have kids,” one user theorized. “But either way, you might call your agent to let them know. The other agent should be more professional w/ clients.” “What in the Goldilocks was going on?!” another wrote. “The agent should have put a stop to it, yes. but people should also have the common decency to maybe NOT f around with other people’s stuff?” asked another TikToker. In a follow-up TikTok, @fortdefiance explained that she noticed the tub immediately because she’s been caring for an injured baby goat that’s been living in there. “So I’ve made absolutely sure it was extra clean and acceptable for human use,” she said. “Clearly they approved.”
