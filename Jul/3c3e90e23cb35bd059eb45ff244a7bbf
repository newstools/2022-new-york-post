Doubt is a funny thing. On the one hand, it makes us stop and think before acting too hastily and rushing into something. On the other hand, doubt also can prevent you from achieving goals or question your own self worth. Doubt is constant in fantasy baseball. Did you give up on that underachieving pitcher too early? In your head you start to say, “The expected stats say he’s going to turn it around, but should I wait? There have been no fewer than 20 players I could’ve picked up to help me close that six-game gap between me and the first-place team. Maybe I should drop him. But, what if he turns it on? Wait … did I leave the iron on?” Roto Rage’s advice: Trust your gut. Not all your moves will work out, but at least you had the guts to swing for the fences. Year after year, Jon Gray was one of those pitchers who would be listed among the potential breakout candidates. Year after year, Gray would show flashes. Year after year, Gray would ultimately never fully live up to the hype. Then, the right-hander left Colorado … After a rough April and May (1-2, 5.56 ERA, .248 opponents average), the 30-year-old Ranger has turned things around in a pretty big way. Over his past 10 starts (since June 1), Gray has allowed more than three earned runs just twice while going 6-2 with a 2.34 ERA and .204 opponents’ average. He has won six of his past seven starts while maintaining a 1.85 ERA with a 48-7 strikeout-walk rate, .209 opponents average and .579 OPS. During that 10-game stretch, he had the second most wins (six) in the majors, the 13th-best strikeouts per nine (10.65), the 11th-best ERA (2.34) and the 19th-best swinging strike rate (12.6 percent). He had a 2.88 FIP and 2.90 xFIP in that span. Gray entered the weekend with the ninth-best strikeout rate (27 percent), 22nd-best opponents average (.218) and ranked 17th in swinging strike rate (12.2 percent). He also ranked 33rd in ERA (3.42) and 27th in WHIP (1.12, a career-best mark). Over seven seasons with the Rockies, Gray’s ERA finished under 4.00 just twice and never finished under 3.50. Though Gray’s fastball can hit 98 mph, opposing hitters are hitting .279 against it. He does his damage with his slider — a pitch he is using 36.3 percent of the time. Opponents are hitting .159 against it with a 40.3 percent whiff rate and 21.5 percent swinging-strike rate. His expected stats also support the success of his slider. Gray’s xERA (3.54) is ever-so-slightly above his ERA, his FIP (3.28) and xFIP (3.27) show his performance is legit — and could potentially improve in the second half, even with a challenging schedule. After pitching six scoreless innings against Miami on Thursday, Gray’s potential schedule may not look like it would work in his favor. Barring injuries or unexpected interruptions to the schedule, he is scheduled to pitch seven of his next 11 starts on the road, where he is 3-4 with a 3.74 ERA, 1.18 WHIP and .224 opponents average in 12 road starts. His opponents could include the Mariners, Angels, Astros (twice), Twins, Red Sox and Marlins. Roto Rage says don’t let doubt creep into your head and wait until he is home, where he has had far more success (4-0, 2.93 ERA, 0.98 WHIP, 12.3 K/9 in five starts), to put him in your rotation. He isn’t in Colorado any more. If you need dependable pitchers in your lineup, Gray is proving he can and will be just that (even with an occasional dud). Don’t doubt it.
