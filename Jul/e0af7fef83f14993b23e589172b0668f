A British television moderator of a debate between the country’s two prime ministerial candidates collapsed live on the air, prompting a horrified, on-camera reaction from one of the candidates. Kate McCann was moderating the debate between the two leading Conservative Party candidates who are vying to succeed Boris Johnson as premier — Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. During the debate, which was aired by the Sun and Talk TV, Truss is seen reacting with shock and horror as a loud thud is heard in the background. “Oh my God!” Truss is heard exclaiming. The incident happened about half an hour into the hour-long debate, as Truss and Sunak sparred over taxes, how to help families struggling with the soaring cost of living and the best way to fund the National Health Service. The BBC is reporting that McCann “is understood to have fainted and collapsed.” She is reportedly doing OK. McCann tweeted earlier Tuesday that she would be moderating the debate on her own after her partner, Harry Cole, pulled out due to COVID-19. The debate was abruptly ended. McCann is political editor of Talk TV while Cole holds the same role at the Sun. The Sun and Talk TV are owned by Rupert Murdoch, who is the founder of The Post’s parent company News Corp. Truss and Sunak are battling to succeed Johnson, who quit as leader of the governing Conservative Party on July 7 after months of ethics scandals triggered a mass exodus of ministers from his government.
