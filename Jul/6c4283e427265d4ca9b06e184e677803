The Sharks are circling in on David Quinn. San Jose is “zeroing in” on signing Quinn as their next head coach, according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman. The former Rangers coach seems to have won the job over other finalists, including Pittsburgh Penguins’ Mike Velluccici and Toronto Maple Leafs’ Spencer Carbery, who both would’ve become first-time NHL head coaches if chosen. The possibility of a Sharks-Quinn communion first gained momentum after Mike Grier was named San Jose’s general manager on July 6. Grier, now the first black GM in the history of the NHL, shares the same alma mater as Quinn, as the duo both played at Boston University under all-time great Jack Parker. While their playing careers never overlapped – Grier played from 1993-’96 whereas Quinn played from 1984-’88, they both share a strong fondness for the program. Quinn served as the bench boss for the Terriers from 2013 to 2018, powering the team to an impressive 100-59-20 record before leaving the university to join the Rangers as head coach. The 55-year-old led the Blueshirts from 2018-’21, during which they boasted a 96-87-25 record over 208 regular season games. He was ultimately released from his position after failing to make the playoffs in the shortened 2021 season. As for the Sharks, their decision to part ways with former head coach Bob Boughner alongside three other members of his coaching staff earlier this offseason came as a surprise to many across the league. Quinn has often proven his ability to build successful organizations, both on the college and national level. Now, an ailing franchise in need of a rebuild will see if he can do it again.
