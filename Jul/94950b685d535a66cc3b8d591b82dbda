A northern Michigan marina closed over the Fourth of July weekend after actor Tim Allen’s yacht leaked fuel into the water, a report said. Roughly 30 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from Allen’s yacht on Sunday at the Northport Village Marina, located roughly 30 miles northwest of Traverse City, the Traverse City Record-Eagle reported. According to Harbormaster Bill Rosemurgy, the spill was significant enough to cause the marina to shut down on Sunday evening and all day Monday. The marina reopened Monday night. Rosemurgy said that while 30 gallons may not seem like a lot of fuel, diesel spreads much faster than regular gasoline. Officials told the paper the leak was the result of a fuel filter issue on the boat that caused diesel to spill in the yacht’s engine compartment. Once the compartment was filled with fuel, the bilge pump dumped the fuel out into the marina. Allen said that the fuel filter gasket broke while he was taking the boat around Omena Bay. He is responsible for covering the clean-up costs. The “Home Improvement” actor claims only about 11 gallons leaked, contrary to the marina’s estimate. “I felt very uncomfortable closing the harbor down for everybody,” Allen told the Record-Eagle. The marina and officials from Mackinac Environmental and the Leelanau Township Fire Department deployed brooms and hundreds of absorbent pads to clean up the diesel from the water. The US Coast Guard was made aware of the spill and is overseeing the marina’s cleanup efforts. Witnesses told the paper they saw several dead ducklings, carp and pike in the marina after the spill, however Leelanau Township Fire Chief Hugh Cook said it doesn’t appear as if the spill affected any wildlife. A beach and playground just south of the marina was also closed on Monday after fuel washed up on the shore.
