Jimmy Garoppolo’s time in San Francisco may soon be coming to an end. 49ers brass has given Garroppolo’s camp permission to seek a trade, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Wednesday. The quarterback, who underwent offseason surgery on his throwing shoulder, has also been cleared to start practicing, per ESPN, with San Francisco “expected to exercise caution with him this summer.” Training camp begins next week. It has long been expected that the 49ers would move on from Garoppolo after they selected former North Dakota State product Trey Lance third overall in last year’s draft. A former second-round pick, Garoppolo arrived in San Francisco via trade from New England during the 2017 season. Over the course of five seasons, Garoppolo tossed for 11,162 yards and 66 touchdowns with a 67.7 completion percentage. Despite putting up impressive numbers, however, the 49ers failed to reach milestones with him at the helm, including Super Bowl 2020 against the Chiefs, and this year’s NFC Championship versus the Rams. Now that Garoppolo’s agents, Don Yee and Carter Chow, are free to explore a new home for the quarterback, speculation will ramp up about where he’ll end up. Garoppolo was most recently linked to the Seahawks, who traded superstar quarterback Russell Wilson to the Broncos in March. Regardless of where Garoppolo goes, this move from the team essentially signifies that the 49ers are turning the page and looking ahead to a new chapter.
