Daniel Edelman remembers it so clearly. His first visit to FC Barcelona’s famed Camp Nou in 2016 on a tour of Spain with a US Club Soccer all-star team … the way the fans’ chants echoed through the stadium … the greats of the sport astride the pitch … Lionel Messi standing over a free kick just outside the 18-yard box — and bending it into the top corner of the goal. “Unreal,” Edelman says now. “So special.” Edelman is about to see the global headliners from Barcelona again, only this time it’s as an opponent. And they’re coming onto his team’s home turf. On Saturday night, the Red Bulls will host Barcelona at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey, a Daniel-versus-Goliath friendly that doubles as an international showcase for the local MLS team and a rare chance for New York soccer fans to see one of the sport’s true superpowers — plus a handful of its superstars — in person.
