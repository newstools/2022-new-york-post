Kodak Black was released from jail Saturday on $75,000 bond after being arrested near Fort Lauderdale for allegedly possessing dozens of oxycodone pills. The 25-year-old rapper was seen leaving Broward County jail in video posted by a reporter from NBC 6 South Florida. His lawyer told Rolling Stone the bond had been negotiated at a hearing Saturday morning for the rapper, whose legal name is Bill Kahan Kapri. Florida Highway Patrol pulled Black over in Fort Lauderdale for window tints that authorities said were darker than is legal, Bloomberg reported. Cops reportedly smelled marijuana and searched the South Florida rapper’s vehicle, turning up 31 oxy pills and $74,960 in cash, the outlet said. Black’s license and vehicle tag were also both expired, according to the report. The “Super Gremlin” rapper has been in and out of jail and prison throughout his life. He was sentenced to four years in prison in 2019 for weapons possession, only to have his sentence commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2021. Black’s attorney Bradford Cohen said his client would be vindicated in court. “Never Judge (sic) a case based on an arrest,” Cohen posted on Twitter on Saturday morning. “There are always additional facts and circumstances that give rise to a defense, especially in this case. We will get him a bond today and move forward with resolving the matter quickly.”
