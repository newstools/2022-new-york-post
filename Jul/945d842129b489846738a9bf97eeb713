Saquon Barkley and Reggie Bush have been linked together since April 26, 2018, but now it might actually matter on the field for the first time. It was almost too fitting when Giants head coach Brian Daboll recently invoked Bush’s name in response to a question about his history of calling plays for a running back with a unique skill set. After all, Barkley (2018) became the first running back since Bush (2006) to be selected with the No. 2 pick in the NFL Draft, and then Barkley (91 catches) promptly broke Bush’s rookie record (88) for receptions by a running back. Three turbulent seasons later, Barkley is playing in one of Bush’s former offenses for the first time, which just might be the key to unlocking his full capacity. “The thing I like about Daboll is just how innovative he is,” Bush told The Post. “I had my best years as a running back in Miami. I think that speaks volumes to Daboll and the offense he brings in. He doesn’t say, ‘I’m going to fit players into my system.’ He works with what he has, and I think that’s the ultimate sign of a players’ coach. When you have a coach who can’t adjust, it shows.”
