Few holidays are better spent outside than the 4th of July. Leading up to fireworks, there’s always time for some fun and games. Get the family together, put clubs in hands, and spend your time before the fireworks playing the PutterBall Backyard Golf Game. This simple backyard golf game can even be fun for people who have never golfed or say they don’t know how. During our 4th of July Sale, it’s only $143.96 (Reg. $189) with code JULY20. PutterBall is a unique combination of golf and beer pong, but alcohol isn’t required. What you get is a strip of turf with six holes on either side. When it’s your turn, putt from your side and aim for one of your opponent’s open spots. If you get it in, they cover it up with one of the turf hole covers. Every time you get a ball in a hole, you can have your opponent drink, or just play for the fun of the game. If you’re planning on tailgating anytime soon, PutterBall should be in your trunk. Rolled up, it takes up very little space. “Easy to setup and to put away. Box makes it easy to transport,” says one buyer. Throw some beers in a cooler with your favorite game in the trunk and head out for the 4th in style. When you’re with friends, roll out the turf board, take out the two included putters, and have yourself a ball. Bring the kids in to play while you man the barbecue.
