“Nope” managed the superhero-worthy feat of dethroning “Thor: Love and Thunder” as top box-office draw on its opening night. After spending two weeks in the box office lead, “Thor” was overshadowed Friday by the newest sci-fi horror film by Jordan Peele — who doesn’t want to be called one of the greatest fright filmmakers of our time. On its Friday release alone, “Nope” raked in over $19.5 million, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. Thor, meanwhile, took in close to $6.4 million, bringing the Marvel/Disney flick to $144.2 million domestically. Worldwide, the movie has topped $526 million in receipts. “Minions: The Rise of Gru,” which The Hollywood Reporter said proved that groups that may have been wary of returning to theaters “are willing to go back for the right film,” took home third place with close to $5.2 million in sales. It’s sold $107 million in US theaters and $559.7 million worldwide since its July 1 opener. “Where the Crawdads Sing,” which has sparked controversy after the author whose book the movie is based upon was sought for questioning in a murder, landed in fourth place with $3.2 million in sales. In its two weeks in US theaters, it’s taken in $17.3 million. “Top Gun: Maverick,” — which recently made headlines as the ninth-highest grossing movie in domestic box office history, according to Variety — flew down to fifth place, pulling in $2.7 million, for a total $628 million domestically and $1.25 billion worldwide since its May 27 debut.
