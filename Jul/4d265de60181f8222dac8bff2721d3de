Cops in a historic Arizona ghost town popular with tourists have been forced to remind locals that justice in the Old West should be doled out with civility these days. Jerome, located 110 miles north of Phoenix, is inundated with around a million visitors a year — and some of the town’s 450 residents, who are usually outnumbered by more than five-to-one, have had enough. The fed-up locals have been yelling at tourists and leaving notes on their cars out of frustration, officials said. The national historic site is a former home to a large copper mine and now attracts a stream of artists and looky-loos who come for the town’s mountain views and quaint local saloons and stores. It “has come to our attention that some people visiting our town on short visits and using lawful short term parking passes are being yelled at or having notes left on their cars by local residents,” police wrote on Facebook this week. “Yelling at, or leaving notes could, in some cases, constitute harassment under Arizona Revised Statutes.” Residents who believed that tourists skirted parking rules were encouraged to take the matter up with law enforcement rather than confronting the culprits.
