All good things must come to an end. Gardner Minshew, the backup quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, is selling his fabled “love shack” bus for $25,000, he announced this week on Instagram, where he also revealed that he’s called the vehicle home for the past several months. “Since February of this year, I have been living in my bus. Mostly at my gym @ctpswfl, some at our practice facility in Philly, and a whole bunch of places in between,” Minshew began. “A few things I’ve learned in this time: if you have a dream to chase, things to learn, and people to love, then you don’t need much else. It’s not as important to know what’s around the bend, as it is to trust that you’ll be able to handle whatever it is. And finally, bus lovin’ is some of the best lovin’ there is!” Minshew then hit his followers with a buying opportunity with the hope that his beloved bus finds a nice home. “With that being said and in all seriousness(), I am selling my baby in Philly. This former inmate transport bus has been completely rehabilitated and would be perfect as a tailgater (for Birds games), semi or permanent residence, and obviously and most tastefully as a love shack baby. This grisled vet has seen 146k miles,” the 26-year-old quarterback continued. “When I took her to get serviced most recently, the mechanic said in his professional opinion, and I quote, ‘This thing is awesome man!’ Equipped with energy efficient A/C unit, cooktop, and fridge. She’s listing for 25k, but more than anything, I just want to see her in a nice and loving home. Serious inquiries only to the DMs. As stated above . Thank you.” A former sixth-round pick, Minshew is entering his fourth NFL season and is expected to be the second-string quarterback behind Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia. Minshew previously played for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
