Rob Gronkowski may have announced his second retirement from the NFL last month, but a person close to his heart doesn’t buy it. Camille Kostek, Gronkowski’s longtime girlfriend, discussed the Pro Bowl tight end’s departure from football with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit at Miami Swim Week. Despite her boyfriend’s seemingly definitive decision to hang up the cleats, Kostek believes it will only be temporary. “I am an honest lady, and honestly, in my heart, I didn’t feel like this one is a forever one,” Kostek said. “So, I think maybe he’ll come back again.” According to the veteran SI swimsuit model, Gronkowski will likely pull a page out of Tom Brady’s book, his friend and longtime teammate. Earlier this offseason, the Buccaneers signal-caller shocked everyone – including his tight end – by unretiring just 40 days after announcing his own retirement. “I feel like him and Tom are just having fun,” Kostek continued. “Retired, not retired, retired, not retired.” Kostek is not the first member in Gronkowski’s corner to speculate a return for the star tight end. His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, admitted the four-time Super Bowl champion could come back if Brady “calls him during the season.” Brady seemingly expressed his approval of the idea, tweeting a hilarious meme of former congressional candidate Martin Baker making a phone call. As for Gronkowski, the 33-year-old has remained steadfast on his retirement decision. It seems as though it will take more than a phone call for him to step back on the football field. “I’m done with football,” Gronkowski told ESPN’s Mike Reiss. “Love the game. Love the game. And definitely blessed with all the opportunities the game of football has given me. But done with football and stepping my feet into the business world and the business ventures. Just seeing what’s out there and where I can, you know, find my place.” It remains to be seen whether he will hold this same belief come later this season.
