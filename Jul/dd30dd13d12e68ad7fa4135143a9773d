When you want to clean your floor, you shouldn’t have to lug around a different device for mopping, polishing, and scrubbing your hardwood or tile floor. Make cleaning a bit easier for yourself and try out the Elicto ES-530 Electronic Cordless Spin Mop & Polisher. This three-in-one cleaner can help you leave your floor spotless, and for a limited time it’s on sale for $119.99 (Reg. $149). It’s cleaning day at home, and you and your floors need to spend some quality time together. Do you want to take a different pass along your floor each time you want to scrub away dirt, mop away mess, and polish to a stunning shine? Instead of spending hours with a rotation of equipment, just use the Elicto ES-530.  This electric cleaner has a dual-spin mop head that cleans efficiently every time. Clean for up to half an hour at a time on the built-in 2,200 mAh battery. If you’re worried that’s not enough time, think of how much time you’re saving by combining mopping and polishing into one step. As one reviewer writes, “it did a great job cleaning both my hardwood and tile floors (around 1200 square feet of area).” “I love this machine. I have three dogs who track mud into the house. Being able to clean up without pails of water etc. is great,” writes another verified user. Those stubborn messes from pets are no match for a wireless cleaner like this. Plus, when you’re all done cleaning, just remove the cleaning pads from the end of the Elicto. They’re completely machine-washable, so you don’t have to constantly be replacing flimsy cleaning heads. Clean your floor in one pass. For a limited time, you can get the Elicto ES-530 Electronic Cordless Spin Mop & Polisher on sale for $119.99 (Reg. $149). Prices subject to change.
