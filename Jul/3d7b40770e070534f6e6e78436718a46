A Texas man has been arrested in connection with a Dallas woman’s strangulation death more than 30 years ago, police announced. David Rojas, 53, was nabbed Friday and charged with capital murder for the January 1989 cold case slaying of Mary Hague Kelly, the Dallas Police Department announced earlier this week. According to police, officers responded to a report of a “dead person” at a home on North Frances Street near West 8th Street on Jan. 19, 1989. “At the scene, Dallas Police found Mary Hague Kelly, who was pronounced dead at the scene,” police said. “There were no signs of forced entry into the home, but Kelly’s personal belongings and her vehicle had been taken from the scene.” Investigators obtained DNA samples from Kelly’s remains. Meanwhile, a medical examiner determined Kelly had been strangled. More than 33 years later, DNA collected from Kelly’s body matched to Rojas, police said. It was not immediately clear how Rojas knew Kelly, if at all. Police did not specify a motive. The Dallas Morning News reported that Kelly was 78 years old when she was killed. Jail records show Rojas was ordered held on $750,000 bond. Rojas’ attorney, Sherrod J. Edwards, would not immediately comment when contacted on Tuesday.
