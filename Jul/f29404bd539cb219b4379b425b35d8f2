A Bronx dirt bike rider was badly burned when his bike burst into flames after crashing into a New York City parks department vehicle, cops said. The fiery accident happened at East 138 Street and Willow Street in the Mott Haven section around 8 p.m., officials said. The driver slammed into the rear of a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation vehicle and became pinned under his bike — which ignited, according to the NYPD. He was taken to Harlem Hospital where he was in critical condition Saturday night, police said. The patient suffered burns over most of his body and was not wearing a helmet, sources told The Post. Operating a dirt bike or ATV is illegal in the five boroughs because many drivers don’t have insurance or proof of registration, according to police. “They are not only a nuisance and an annoyance to us, but they’re extremely dangerous,” Mayor Eric Adams said last week at a Brooklyn news conference. City officials bulldozed and demolished nearly a hundred confiscated vehicles at the event. The bikes were destroyed rather than being sold or donated to prevent them from ending up back on the city streets, the mayor said.
