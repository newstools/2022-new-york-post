A man was wounded in a shooting outside a Queens nightclub early Monday, while a teen was shot during a robbery in Brooklyn, cops said. The 25-year-old man took a bullet to the stomach on 41st Street near Astoria Boulevard South in Astoria around 2:15 a.m., police said. The shooting took place after a fight started inside the club and spilled out into the street, police sources said. He was taken to NYU Brooklyn Hospital in stable condition. A little more than an hour later, an 18-year-old man was shot in the hand during a cell-phone robbery at Polar Street and Seagate Avenue in Seagate, cops said. The victim was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, where he also was treated for non-life-threatening injuries.
