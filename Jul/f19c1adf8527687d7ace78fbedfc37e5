For the price of a discount NYC mansion, this entire slice of paradise could be yours. On a sunny island in the Atlantic, an indulgent resort-like mansion has hit the market, offering a sweet escape and the potential for commercial income. The 30,000-square-foot Turks & Caicos property is currently listed for $30 million by Ian Hurdle with The Agency. Built as a “passion project by its original owner” before selling to French super investor Fabrice Grinda for $11.5 million in 2019, the Triton Luxury Villa is soon set to undergo a “metamorphosis” of a renovation, press materials boast. The massive makeover will include the addition of four guest bungalows and a staff quarters to the white palette, blue-accented beachside haven. This will bring it from a seven-bed, eight-bath home to a 14-bed, 13-bath one. In addition to the heavenly location, other amenities include a heated glass-front, beach-facing pool, outdoor cinema, two dining areas, two beach decks, a fire pit, tennis court and gymnasium, all set on two acres. Throughout the property, there is a Sonos sound system and a custom interior and exterior Hue light system. Each room in the villa is equipped with an in-room television, ensuite bathrooms, “luxury linens from Frette and Toiletries from Le Labo and Molton Brown” as well as a king-sized bed — except one room that has two sets of twin bunk beds. Buyers may also be enticed by the promise of extremely good Wi-Fi, the home’s website notes: In 2023, the SpaceX-operated satellite internet constellation Starlink is set to provide the nation’s subscribers super high-speed internet. The property was recently used to host the cast of the Peacock series “Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip” in addition to “countless other celebrities” since its 2017 construction. The listing also notes it is the “signature estate” of Long Bay Beach, a world-famous kiting destination.
