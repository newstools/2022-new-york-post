Andrew Copp is heading home. Copp, an Ann Arbor native and former Michigan Wolverine, signed a five-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings not long after the start of NHL free agency on Wednesday. The deal is reportedly worth $28.125 million with an annual average value of $5.625 million. Copp acted as a catalyst for the Rangers last season after being dealt by the Winnipeg Jets at the trade deadline. In 16 regular-season games with the Blueshirts, Copp registered 18 points in an effort to propel his team to the playoffs. He later served as an integral contributor in their magical run to the Eastern Conference Final, posting 14 points (six goals and eight assists) over 20 playoff games. There were questions about whether the Rangers would be able to retain either Copp or Ryan Strome as they sought to sort out their second-line center conundrum. The Rangers quickly filled the large hole, signing Vincent Trocheck to a seven-year deal worth $39.375 million. Copp is not the only member of the Rangers 2022 squad who will be leaving New York. Forward Frank Vatrano signed with the Anaheim Ducks on a $10.95 million three-year contract that boasts an average annual value of $3.65 million, according multiple reports.
