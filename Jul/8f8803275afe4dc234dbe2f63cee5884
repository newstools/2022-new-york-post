The Knicks’ new point guard offered a simple message to the team’s fans on Saturday. “Ready to start a new chapter New York! Let’s go!” Jalen Brunson tweeted, accompanied by a Statue of Liberty emoji and a small blue and a small orange diamond. Brunson agreed to a four-year, $104 million on Thursday night to leave the Mavericks for the Knicks. Brunson’s profile photo is now of himself as a child wearing a Knicks T-shirt. He attended games at the Garden as a kid when his father, Rick, played for the Knicks. Brunson also said goodbye to the Mavericks on Twitter and Instagram, thanking the entire organization. “You have embraced me from the moment you drafted me,” the 25-year-old wrote. “You believed in me and were able to watch me grow as a person and a player. This city will forever hold a special place in my heart.”
