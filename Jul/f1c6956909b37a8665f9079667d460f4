Police are looking to track down a man they say repeatedly sexually assaulted his 11-year-old stepdaughter in Staten Island over the course of 18 months. Juan Mendieta, 40, victimized the pre-teen “on multiple occasions” inside a home at Van Duzer and Bay streets, between October 1, 2020, and April 20, 2022, cops said. Police released a photo of the suspect Tuesday and are requesting help from the public in tracking him down. Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).
