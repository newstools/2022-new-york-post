NHL star Bobby Ryan was arrested at Nashville International Airport on Monday after police reported that he appeared to be intoxicated in the terminal. According to court documents obtained by TMZ Sports, Ryan was seen on CCTV shoplifting, before ditching the stolen items on a counter and entering a bar in the concourse. Officers then made contact with him inside the bar and claimed he showed signs of intoxication. Ryan was reportedly “not compliant with officers, had slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and smelled strongly of an alcoholic beverage,” according to authorities. The 35-year-old, who is currently a free agent, was booked on public intoxication charges, as police reports said he “was unaware of his location, the day or time and posed a danger to himself.” The case has since been dismissed with no further explanation yet. Ryan, who most recently played for the Detroit Red Wings, has had substance issues throughout his entire NHL career. In 2019 he stepped away from hockey to get sober before making a triumphant return with the Ottawa Senators, scoring a hat trick in his first game back. The former Anaheim Duck was awarded the Bill Masterson Memorial Trophy after that season, which is presented to “the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey.” Ryan did not play in the NHL last season.
