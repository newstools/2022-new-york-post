While Mark Canha stood at his spot in left field for the Mets against the Padres, ESPN broadcasters began to probe him with a “hard-cutting” question. “We’re getting into politics already?” Canha quipped back. It wasn’t politics. Close. But instead about the proper pronunciation of his last name. The 33-year-old revealed his last name is pronounced differently – it’s Can-YA and not Ca-na – along with other pieces of information in a revealing mic’d up interview during the Mets’ game against the Padres at Citi Field on Sunday Canha, mainly, brought jokes with his bubbly personality. At one point during the interview, Canha made a jest toward his foodie reputation. “You guys know how I like to eat, this can help pay for all those meals,” he said. Canha added he enjoys to drink champagne with every nice meal. “Why drink anything else,” he asked rhetorically. The outfielder also disclosed Jeff McNeil sometimes eats “Lunchables” for his pre-game meals – something which Canha believes gives “the Squirrel” the worst taste in food on the Mets. Besides food, Canha also touched on baseball too and his defensive schemes while playing the outfield. Canha has been a bright spot for the Mets, who hold one of the best records in the majors, by being a consistent contact hitter with a .265 hitting average and a .370 OBP. The left fielder was picked up by New York this past off-season, inking a two-year, $26.5 deal.
