Talk about missing the mark. Cameron Young, the 25-year-old PGA Tour rookie who’s made waves at the 2022 British Open this week, was swift to correct a reporter who asked about his “improbable journey from the streets of New York” to the “links of St. Andrews.” Young, who played on the golf team at Fordham Preparatory School in The Bronx before committing to Wake Forest University, laughed and said, “I think the streets of New York is probably a stretch. “Fordham Prep is on Fordham University campus. It’s beautiful. And I lived at Sleepy Hollow Country Club, where my dad is the head pro. I lived on the lower course out there,” said Young, whose father David is the longtime golf pro at Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Westchester County. “I took the train to school, but I also took the train back home to go practice. It might sound a little improbable, but I’ve been around golf my whole life. That’s just kind of what I do.” The internet was quick to acknowledge the “over-reaching” comment and several critics called out the unnamed reporter. Young — the 32nd-ranked golfer in the world — has emerged as a contender at the Open Championship in Scotland, where he shot an eight-under 64 in his first round. He is in second at -11 behind Cameron Smith heading into the weekend.
