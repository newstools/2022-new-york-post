Natasha Bure wants to make her own way in Hollywood. The 23-year-old — who is the daughter of Candace Cameron Bure — denied claims that she receives acting roles due to her famous mama. “A lot of people will kind of assume that if I get any job or work at all that it’s from her,” Bure said on “Today” about fans claiming nepotism. “Or it’s given to me or it’s handed to me, and it’s honestly quite literally the opposite.” The “Home Sweet Home” star went on: “I work hard for everything that I do, and I’m out here like everyone else just grinding and trying to follow my dreams and make them come true. So I think that’s one misconception that’s a little bit frustrating to see.” The Los Angeles native also pointed out that it’s “a struggle” to be an actor and that she’s “honestly just like every other person out there, and I’m just trying to stay on the grind and do my best.” “It’s difficult for sure. I grind, but I’m grateful for any opportunity that I get and I’m just trying to work my hardest to get to where I want to be,” Natasha said. The social media influencer even divulged the “biggest pieces of advice” she received from the “Full House” alum, 46. “She gave it to me a while ago, it’s to say yes to things that scare you and to really go after things that are out of your comfort zone,” she said. “Because those are the types of experiences that are really going to push you in your life.” And while the “Faith, Hope & Love” actress doesn’t want to follow her mom’s career in the rom-com route, she hopes to find “raw and gritty” dramatic roles in her acting future. Natasha’s first role was in 2011 when she guest-starred on Candace’s ABC Family TV show, “Make It or Break It.” She later portrayed a younger version of the Hallmark queen in the network’s 2015 series “Aurora Teagarden Mysteries.”
