A New York man has been slammed on social media after “drunkenly” texting two women for a booty call in the same chat. One of the women, named Emma, shared a screenshot of the embarrassing exchange in a Facebook dating group, captioning the messages: “Who said chivalry is dead?!” The man, named Tyler, kicked off the conversation with the five words all people looking for a hook-up are wont to use: “What are you up to?” “Sleeping lol you???” Emma wrote back. “I need someone to snuggle with,” Tyler responded. “You up for that?” It seemed like any other late-night exchange – that was until a third party (seemingly added to the chat by Tyler) chimed in with: “Hey it’s Hannah. Who’s this?” “Tyler from Friday but also last night – lmao I don’t think I’ve ever drunk-texted a group chat before,” he wrote. Only for Emma to question him: “So you were bootycalling us both?” Dozens of women in the comments under Emma’s post were left speechless by the man’s antics. “Wait a damn min …‘from Friday and last night?’ So you went over there?? Lmao I’m confused fill me in on what I’m reading lol,” commented one. “I met him Friday night and I think Hannah met him ‘last night’ – literally group bootycalled 2 of us he met over the weekend,” Emma explained. To which the woman responded: “What a sack of numbnuts”. “Omg!!!! Lmao!! What an idiot,” commented another. “Not the group chat?!!! Omg screaming,” wrote a third. “Literally cannot make this stuff up. This is gold.” Others hoped that Hannah and Emma had been bonded by the experience, with one woman writing, “Please tell me you and Hannah are now bffs and have dumped the dude.” “You should invite Hannah to join this [Facebook] group on your group text,” another suggested.
