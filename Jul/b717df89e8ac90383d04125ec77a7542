An intrepid mascot agreed to do the Oklahoma drill with A.J. Dillon, a bowling ball of a man. Over the weekend, the video went viral showing the Packers’ running back, who weighs 247 pounds and propels his body with some of the thickest thighs you’ve ever seen, trucking the mascot for the Northwoods League’s Kenosha Kingfish. By contrast, the human behind the mascot, Trey Meier, told The Athletic that he stands at a lean five-foot-nine, 150 pounds. “The emcee who was running the game actually told me, ‘Oh, yeah, you’re gonna be doing the Oklahoma drill with AJ Dillon,’” Meier told the outlet. “Right when I found out about me doing the Oklahoma drill, I actually texted my dad,” Meier said. “I was like, ‘Guess who’s about to do the Oklahoma drill against AJ Dillon?’ He texted me back and was like, ‘What?! You got this.’ And yeah, I did not have it at all.” Meier, who works part-time for $12.50 an hour in his role as Elvis the Kingfish, and clearly deserves much more than that in hazard pay, was more concerned about the guise of being a mascot than he was with his own health amid the circumstances. “The one thing that I was worried about when I got hit, I was like, ‘I’ve got to get my head back on,’ ” said Meier, who re-affixed his head about five seconds after it flew off. “I got the wind knocked out of me a little bit, but I got up right away. I got my head back on, and I’d say that’s the only thing I regret, my head coming off, because there are now a couple kids in the stands who just saw Elvis without a head. “I kind of played it off like the head was supposed to come off, like I was kind of trying to pump up the crowd a little bit, but that was not supposed to happen, and I got the head on as quickly as possible.”
