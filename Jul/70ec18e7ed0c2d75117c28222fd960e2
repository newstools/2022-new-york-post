This new lunch emoji-themed brain-buster has onlookers stumped. The puzzle inquires players to solve an equation using the answer to three other questions that have been done for you. The veggie illusion first surfaced on TikTok, posted by user @puzzlegame21. The first math problem shows three taco emojis that are added together to equal 60. The second formula says that the amount of three salad emojis is 30. The third line reveals three cucumber emojis added to one another totals 24. The final equation is left for the viewer to solve and they must answer it within 20 seconds to demonstrate their smarty pants-ness. The puzzle wants the person to determine the value of each emoji and one should use the prior equations to get the answer. [Warning: Spoilers below] The last line asks: “[Taco emoji] + [cucumber emoji] x [salad emoji] = ?? Because the first two equations only use addition, players can assume that the last puzzle is also just using addition. The answer would then be 38, as the taco’s number is 20, the salad’s value is 10 and the cucumber’s worth is eight. However, that would not be correct due to the multiplication symbol placed in the calculation. Keep scrolling to learn the answer! The answer to the math problem is 100. How do you get there? One must first multiply the values of the cucumber (8) and the salad (10) — which comes to 80 — and then add the taco’s value (20) to that. Therefore, the sum can be read as: 20 + (10 x 8), or 20 + 80 = 100, according to the mathematical formula PEMDAS.
