Donald Trump is scheduled to be at this week’s LIV Golf Invitational at his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J. The former president will play with Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson in Thursday’s pro-am ahead of the first round, a tournament official confirmed to The Post. That Trump will be paired with DeChambeau and Johnson is hardly a surprise. He has played with them both before in South Florida. DeChambeau’s bag also used to feature Trump’s logo. Trump won’t be the only big name on hand for the controversial Saudi-backed league. Charles Barkley, Caitlyn Jenner and Lawrence Taylor are among those scheduled to participate in Thursday’s pro-am. Barkley is in talks to join the outfit in a broadcasting capacity, The Post first reported last week. On Monday, the NBA Hall of Famer and TNT analyst said on “The Dan Patrick Show” he has issued an ultimatum to LIV that they need to make an offer this week or he’s not interested. “I’m not gonna keep TNT in limbo,” Barkley told Patrick. “I don’t think it’s fair to them. They’ve gotten plenty of play out of me coming to play out there Thursday. I’m not just gonna be no show pony. Don’t be wasting my time. I’m not gonna waste y’all time. When I leave New Jersey Thursday night, when I leave the golf course, if I don’t have an offer, it’s over.” LIV Golf has come under scrutiny for being backed by the Saudi Arabian government amid human rights concerns associated with that country. It has also drawn the ire of several September 11 groups, particularly this week with Ground Zero for the 9/11 terrorist attacks less than 50 miles from Bedminster. Trump has dismissed human rights concerns over Saudi Arabia in recent days while also blasting the PGA Tour for its hard-line stance against the rival circuit, which has included suspending players from the PGA Tour who participate in LIV.
