The Supreme Court’s security chief has asked officials in Maryland and Virginia to pull the plug on picketing and “threatening activity” outside justices’ homes — after the US Department of Justice dragged its feet on enforcing federal laws barring such protests. Supreme Court Marshal Gail Curley wrote letters to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan — both Republicans — and county leaders in both states, citing state and local statutes prohibiting demonstrations outside private residences. “For weeks on end, large groups of protesters chanting slogans, using bullhorns, and banging drums have picketed Justices’ homes,” Curley wrote in letters dated July 1 and released Saturday. The requests came one day after a score of pro-abortion demonstrators swarmed the home of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in Falls Church, Va. — and three weeks after an armed man was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Montgomery County, Md. home and charged with attempted murder. The activist group Ruth Sent Us doxxed the court’s conservative justices in early May, when an unprecedented leak of a draft opinion revealed their plans to overturn Roe v. Wade. Hogan and Youngkin, both Republicans, have called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to defuse the protests, citing a federal law prohibiting demonstrations meant to influence a judge in a pending case — to no avail.
