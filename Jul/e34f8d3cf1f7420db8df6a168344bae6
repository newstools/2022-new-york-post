A man was wounded in a broad-daylight shooting in Brooklyn on Wednesday, cops said. The victim, whose age was not immediately known, was blasted once in the leg during a dispute on Van Sicklen Street near Lloyd Court in Gravesend around 10:20 a.m., police said. He was taken to Maimonides Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. The burst of gun violence came hours after a 35-year-old man was shot in the chest during a dispute on the grounds of NYCHA’s Farragut Houses in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, authorities said. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. Earlier in the evening, a 31-year-old man was shot in the torso on Bedford Avenue near Montgomery Street in Crown Heights around 6:50 p.m., cops said. He was taken to the Kings County Hospital Center, also in stable condition. The violence comes after a bloody Fourth of July weekend that saw 51 people shot in 36 separate incidents between Friday and Monday.
