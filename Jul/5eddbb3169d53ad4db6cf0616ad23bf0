Former President Barack Obama is up for the small screen’s biggest prize. Obama, 60, nabbed an Emmy nomination on Tuesday for his voiceover work in the Netflix docuseries “Our Great National Parks.” The two-term Democrat is up against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Attenborough, W. Kamau Bell and Lupita Nyong’o in the outstanding narrator category. Obama already has two Grammys under his belt for best spoken word album. He won in 2006 for “Dreams from My Father” and in 2008 for “The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream.” President Dwight Eisenhower is the only other US leader to have won television’s highest honor. He was awarded an Emmy in 1956 while still in office for his innovative “use and encouragement” of the emerging medium, according to IMDB. Former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have also notched Grammys for best spoken word album. The 74th Primetime Emmy Awards will be held on Sept. 12. The HBO series “Succession” garnered 25 nominations to lead the pack. “Ted Lasso” and “The White Lotus” each secured 20 nods.
