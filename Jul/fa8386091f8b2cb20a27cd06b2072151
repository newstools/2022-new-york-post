Shark sightings forced the Parks Department to close Rockaway Beach for swimming Saturday on one of the hottest days of the summer. “Beach goers are not allowed in the water at this time, but the boardwalk and concessions remain open,” the department tweeted at 2:14 p.m. Thousands of New Yorkers flocked to city beaches Saturday, the fifth day of a heat wave that sent temps soaring into the mid 90s. A Rockaway Beach lifeguard said there had been “multiple sightings” including one around 11:00 a.m. near the rocks at Beach 92nd Street. “I saw one the other day, not today,” the lifeguard said. Still, swimmers were trying to cool off in the ocean as guards blew their whistles to keep them out. “It’s hard when there’s a heatwave. I can’t blame them for dipping their feet in the water,” the lifeguard said. The sightings came on the same day the new Rockaway Rocket express ferry service began operating from Lower Manhattan to the Queens beach.
