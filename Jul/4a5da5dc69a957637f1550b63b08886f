Alexander Bublik was less than pleased after losing to Maxime Cressy for the ATP Hall of Fame Open title in Newport, R.I. The fourth-seeded Cressy stormed back to defeat No. 3 seed Bublik on Sunday, 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (3). Their battle lasted two hours and 23 minutes. After the match, as is customary, Bublik went up to make his runner-up speech. He began with a normal comment, saying, “There is not much to say. To be honest with you I’m very upset with the outcome, but I would like to congratulate Max for his first title.” It was after this, however, that Bublik raised eyebrows with this choice of words for his speech. “I mean, if you have that great luck put all your money on red please, you’re gonna win big time,” Bublik said. Bublik was clearly not happy with the way his cards fell in the final. Before the final point of the first set, Cressy raced toward the sideline to make a return when he fell and came up grabbing his knee. His trainer was called out and an injury delay was put in place. It was during this delay that Bublik yelled from the baseline, “Stop or continue. Make a decision.” This comment drew boos from the crowd, which eventually built into a “let’s go Cressy” chant. After Cressy came back into the match, Bublik double faulted which sealed the win for Cressy. The loss saw Bublik fall to 1-5 in ATP finals after he came into the day ranked No. 41 in the world. The win for Cressy sent him to No. 33 in the world.
