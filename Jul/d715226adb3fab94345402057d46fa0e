The NYPD on Monday said it is keeping a close eye on large gatherings in the Big Apple amid fears of a copycat attack after the mass shooting that killed at least six people at a Fourth of July parade outside Chicago. “We are monitoring the situation,” an NYPD rep said. A law-enforcement source familiar with the department’s holiday tactical plans — which include safeguarding the famed Macy’s fireworks display over the East River on Monday night — said, “Our deployment is already robust. “We’re watching everything,” the source added. NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell later said in a statement on Twitter, “This morning’s mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, IL is a devastating reminder of the horrific damage gun violence inflicts in our communities. “We want to assure New Yorkers that there are no specific, credible threats to our July Fourth celebrations here in New York City – and we plan to continue as scheduled.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams tweeted, “On this day dedicated to freedom, we’re given a tragic reminder that our right to life and liberty will be at risk so long as we continue to allow illegal guns and violent gunmen to go unchecked. “We pray for Highland Park today, but the time for real action on gun safety is NOW.” -Additional reporting by Nolan Hicks
