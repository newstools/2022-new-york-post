No one is more excited to see Jordan Poyer back in action than his wife, Rachel Bush. On Sunday, Bush praised the Bills safety on Twitter as the 31-year-old reported to training camp despite his desire for a new contract. “A leader, “Bush began. “Nobody even knows how hard this man was working this off-season.” Bush wrote her supportive message alongside a video of Poyer working out at Bills camp, as he and teammates prepare to open the season on the road against the Super Bowl champion Rams. Poyer, who is entering his 10th NFL season, told reporters Sunday he’s “excited to be back out here playing football.” Poyer added that his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, was also present at St. John Fisher University in Pittsford, New York, as practice got underway. “My agent is here,” Poyer said, according to the Bills’ official website. “I know him, and Brandon Beane are talking things through. I’m just excited to be back out here playing football, the game with my teammates. It’s been a journey but I’m here right now. I’m excited to play football and to continue to get better.” Through 16 regular-season games last year, Poyer recorded five interceptions and three sacks. Bush, who has been married to Poyer for four years, frequently champions her husband on social media. Back in December, she backed Poyer after he was left off the AFC Pro Bowl roster. “Said it last year, going to say it again lol pro bowl should have the PROS in it,” she tweeted at the time. “Enough of this voting nonsense. Jordan and [Safety] Micah [Hyde] are the best. Simple facts. Can’t argue with stats. FIVE picks. Top graded coverage. Give me a damn break.” Despite the Pro Bowl snub, Poyer made the All-Pro team last season. He has been with the Bills since 2017.
