The Astros and Angels will complete their three-game series tonight in Los Angeles, and Munaf Manji of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). Houston will send top pitcher Framber Valdez to the hill Thursday night while Los Angeles will counter with Reid Detmers as it seeks to win its second straight game. For Manji, though, he expects the Astros to cruise past the Angels in Los Angeles behind Valdez. “Valdez has been incredible on the road this season for the Houston Astros,” Manji says. “He is 5-2 with an ERA of 1.76 and WHIP…of 0.90.” Valdez has also faced the Angels three times this season, leading Manji to believe his lineup familiarity will give him an advantage. Plus, although the Angels won the most recent contest, the Astros have taken eight of 12 games so far this season. Most importantly, the Astros have won seven of those eight games by at least two or more runs. Further, Houston is 21-8 this season coming off a loss. On the flip-side, the Angels have lost seven consecutive contests with Detmers on the mound. Manji also expects the Astros will batter Detmers given they rank eighth in the league in wRC+ against left-handed pitchers.  For those reasons, back the Astros Run-Line at -105 tonight in the City of Angels.
