A Pennsylvania parking lot collapsed Tuesday, damaging several vehicles and forcing residents of a 56-unit apartment building and nearby stores to evacuate in Allegheny County, according to local reports. No injuries were reported after the lot collapsed into an old parking garage that is now an abandoned warehouse at 11670 Frankstown Road around 6:15 p.m. Penn Hills Police Chief Ron Como told local news outlets that emergency workers checked to ensure no squatters were underneath in the abandoned area. Photos provided by American Red Cross Greater Pennsylvania, which provided shelter for anyone displaced from the collapse, showed multiple cars with significant damage. One witness who was inside a vehicle during the surreal moment said she was “backing up her car” when it all unfolded, Alex Bowens told Pittsburgh’s Action News 4. “I just closed my eyes because my windows were open, so there was gravel and everything in my face and stuff. I looked up when everything was over, and the parking lot collapsed,” said Bowen, who was pulled out of the car with help of an officer. Stores in the vicinity of the apartment building at Penn Hills Shopping Center were also evacuated. Como said there were around 14 cars damaged. The cause of the collapse is under investigation.
