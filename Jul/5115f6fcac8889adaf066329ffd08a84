A gunman killed two people and injured four others – including three Texas police officers – before taking his own life during a shootout near Fort Worth Saturday evening. Police received a 911 call about shots fired in a residential area by an “elderly” woman who was later found to be shot in the leg around 6:45 p.m., according to footage of a press conference at the scene published by WFAA-TV. Officers arrived on the scene and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, injuring three cops who were expected to survive their injuries. Each of the three cops was shot in the leg, and one suffered injuries to his hand, according to Haltom City Police Department Sgt. Rick Alexander The unidentified gunman then took his own life, and was found next to a “military style rifle, and a handgun in the vicinity of his arms,” Alexander said. A woman was found dead inside a home and a man was found fatally shot in the house’s driveway near a motorcycle, according to police. The relationship between the shooter and the victims was not immediately clear. A “fairly lengthy” search for the gunman ended when police found him about a block away from the crime scene. “Let us work; we’ll get all the information out as quick as we can. But, just pray for all of us, the families, and we’ll pull through this, and be strong like we always are,” Alexander said. It was not unclear what led to the violence, which prompted police to issue a statement warning residents to stay in their homes just after 8 p.m. “We are working an active scene and have an armed suspect,” a Facebook post by the department read. “He is described as a white male, dark hair, wearing blue shirt, blue pants, “battle belt,” and is armed with a rifle.” Multiple police officers, including members of a SWAT team, were seen flocking to a residential neighborhood. The Texas Rangers were taking over the investigation, local police said.
