When Adam Sykora came off the ice after scoring the first goal of the prospect scrimmage on Friday, which concluded development camp, the Rangers told him they were going to sign him. “Best day ever,” Sykora, the 63rd-overall pick from this year’s draft, said with a smile that rarely leaves his face. The Rangers signed the Slovakian forward to a three-year, entry-level deal after he showed off his energetic play throughout the prospect camp this week. Sykora opened the scoring during the scrimmage, cleaning up a rebound to jump-start the White team to an eventual 5-1 win. Sykora, 17, will now report to training camp for Team Slovakia ahead of the World Junior Championships. “How can you not like him?” Rangers director of player development Jed Ortmeyer said of Sykora. “He’s got a smile on his face all the time. Just positive, he wants to work, he’s excited to be here. Great energy in the room. It was fun to work with and get to know him this week.”
