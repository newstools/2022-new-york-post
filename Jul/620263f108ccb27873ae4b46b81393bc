Heatwave? Don’t sweat it. At least you won’t when you see this gadget designed to help you beat the heat that is Summer 2022. Sold on Amazon, the Hands Free Portable Neck Fan from Gulaki is now on sale for only $14. If that isn’t enough to convince you, there are also already 11.6 thousand reviews of the product and an average star-rating of 4.5 out of 5. Why is this cooling fan better than AC you may ask? First, the price. But secondly is just how handy it can be to have a cold breeze anywhere you go. Think the steamy subway, a humid cubicle at work or even a stroll around the block with the dogs on a 100-degree day. The fan sits around your neck, blowing onto your face from fans on either side. They can rotate 360 degrees, making sure to hit every angle, and even come with LED lights should you want to wear the contraption on a nighttime walk or to the club. The neck fan is battery powered as well, so there are no pesky cords to carry along, and when not in use around your neck, the fans can sit upright on a desk or counter to be used like any regular fan. We advise you get this fan-favorite fan soon, before the $14 deal cools off for good and the gadget is sold out for summertime. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
