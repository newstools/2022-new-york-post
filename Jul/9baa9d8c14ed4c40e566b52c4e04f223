The US will feel the “wrath of God” if it helps to establish an international tribunal to investigate alleged Russian war crimes — so says Vladimir Putin’s right-hand man on Russia’s Security Council. Dmitry Medvedev, Putin’s deputy on the powerful governing body, made the threat Wednesday in a long diatribe on Telegram, in which he accused Americans of trying “to judge others while staying immune from any trial. “All American history, from the time of the conquest of the Indians, is a bloody war of annihilation,” Medvedev said. “The U.S. and its useless stooges should remember the words of the Bible: Do not judge and you will not be judged … so that the great day of His wrath doesn’t come to their home one day,” he continued. “The idea of ​​punishing the country that has the largest nuclear potential is absurd in itself, and potentially threatens the existence of mankind,” Medvedev said, flaunting Russia’s nuclear arsenal. The US has indicated on multiple occasions that it would back an international war crimes investigation into Russia for the conduct of its soldiers during Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Attorney General Merrick Garland visited Ukraine last month to discuss the possibility of war crimes investigations going forward. US officials have said that Russia’s bombing of civilian targets during the siege of Mariupol constitutes a war crime, as do the allegations of the massacre of civilians in the northern suburbs of Kyiv. Neither the US nor Russia is among the signatories to the International Criminal Court, and neither recognizes its authority. With Post wires
