Embattled Uvalde School Police Chief Pete Arredondo could be fired Saturday as relentless criticism continues over law enforcement’s inaction to stop the mass shooter who killed 21 people at Robb Elementary School, according to a report. An unnamed source close to discussions over Arredondo’s fate told CNN Tuesday Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District officials told the police chief they plan to meet Saturday to determine his future. The source also told CNN the school board is expected to vote to terminate Arredondo, who is already on administrative leave after his role in the delayed and wildly condemned response after shooter Salvador Ramos, 18, entered the school with a rifle. Two sources close to the process also told CNN earlier that Uvalde officials were discussing how to remove Arredondo. An attorney for Arredondo didn’t return a message to CNN. The latest report comes after the school board faced sustained outrage at a meeting Monday demanding Arredondo’s ouster after a damning report from state lawmakers outlined law enforcement’s failure in stopping Ramos sooner. Hundreds of officers from multiple agencies were on the scene, but it took more than an hour for cops to stop the crazed shooter. “If he’s not fired by noon tomorrow, then I want your resignation and every single one of you board members because y’all do not give a damn about our children or us,” Brett Cross, the legal guardian of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, said at the meeting, according to KSAT-TV. “Y’all hired him; y’all can fire him,” said parent Adam Martinez. School Superintendent Hal Harrell said during the meeting he needs school board members to approve Arredondo’s termination before he can make any personnel move.
