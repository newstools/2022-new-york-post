Cyndi Lauper’s hip-hop son was nabbed with a stolen Mercedes after he double-parked it to attend a memorial service for a 14-year-old aspiring rapper fatally stabbed in the subway, cops said Sunday. Declyn “Dex” Lauper, 24, was with the 2014 Mercedes Benz — which had been stolen in 2020 from the Bronx — when cops arrested him around 1:40 a.m. Thursday at West 140th Street and Broadway in Hamilton Heights, police said. The Benz had Pennsylvania plates that came back to a Chrysler, cops said. Declyn told officers he was double-parked to attend “a memorial for a 14-year-old who was stabbed in transit,” a police spokesman told The Post. The slain teen, Ethan Reyes, was stabbed to death in a brawl with a 15-year-old boy July 9 at the 137th Street/City College subway station, cops said. It’s unclear what the dispute was about. Ethan performed under the name “Notti Osama.” Declyn Lauper was hit with a desk-appearance ticket for unlawful possession of stolen property and will have to appear in court at a future date. Declyn — a rapper who also acts under the name Declyn Thornton — is the only child of the “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” singer and her actor husband, David Thornton.
