Your body could be holding onto a lot of pain from stress, injury, and fatigue, but you don’t need to shell out every week for an extensive physical therapist. You may even be able to get some great results at home using a soothing workout machine design to put your body through a healthy rehabilitative workout. The LifePro Waver Mini is a vibration plate that could help your body recover and relax, and for a limited time, it’s only $150 (Reg. $224). We put our bodies through a lot. Even light exercise and games could leave you sore. The LifePro Waver can help you work toward full-body wellness. Through a few simple exercises, you could increase blood flow, improve circulation, protect your nerves, and even loosen stiff joints. With 99 settings to choose from, there’s a lot of room for you to explore the exact vibration that works for you and your body. All of these adjustments can be made by remote, so you don’t even need to stop your workout. While the LifePro can’t replace a doctor or physical therapist, the relief you feel could make the time between appointments that much easier. One user writes, “Eliminates the trauma and tension experienced from RLS, sciatica, and neuropathy in my leg after 10 minutes of use.” In some cases, vibration exercise devices like the LifePro have been found to help with weight loss. The LifePro Mini is only two-feet long at its longest point, and it could even fit under most desks or in the backseat of your car. Give your body a workout on a device that you don’t have to change out of your bathrobe to use. For a limited time, you can get the LifePro Waver Mini Vibration Plate Exercise Machine on sale for only $150 (Reg. $224). Prices subject to change.
