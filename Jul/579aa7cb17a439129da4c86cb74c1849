Forget Mega Millions, how about Mega Billions. There were no winners in Tuesday night’s massive $830 million Mega Millions jackpot — setting the stage for the next drawing, with an estimated grand prize of $1.02 billion. The winning numbers in the latest drawing were 7, 29, 60, 63 and 66. The mega ball number was 15. While nobody hit all six numbers in order to fetch the jackpot, nine Americans across six states did match the five numbers. Eight of the winners, including two in New York and New Jersey, won a cool $1 million prize. The other lucky player hit for $3 million, by matching the five numbers with the megaplier. After numbers were drawn at 11 p.m., the official Mega Millions website crashed. Players looking to check their numbers met with error messages from the apparent sudden surge in web traffic. Friday’s estimated jackpot, as it stands, will be the third-largest prize in Mega Millions history and the fourth-largest lottery jackpot ever won in the US. The largest Mega Millions jackpot was $1.537 billion in October 2018.
