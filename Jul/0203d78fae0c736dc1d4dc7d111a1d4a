Plans for Chris Cuomo’s new TV talk show are coming into focus. The Post has learned that Cuomo’s new show on the fledgling NewsNation TV network will kick off on Oct. 3 and will air on weeknights at 8 p.m. on NewsNation. The name of Cuomo’s show has yet to be revealed. Cuomo’s will be replacing Marni Hughes, who held the primetime slot. She will move to the 10 a.m. to noon block, according to sources. The Post has also learned that NewsNation will try for continuous daytime coverage from noon to 5 p.m. starting in April. A NewsNation rep declined to comment on Thursday. Nexstar rebranded WGN America last year as NewsNation with the goal of launching a “fact-based, unbiased” network that delivers news 24 hours a day by next year. Currently, it has a mix of news and reruns that are averaging around 85,000 total viewers a day. Cuomo revealed his comeback bid on Dan Abrams’ NewsNation show Tuesday night. The news marked the first time Cuomo has appeared on TV since being fired from CNN last year over his role in advising his older brother, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
