Chris Hemsworth’s muscles are worthy of “marvel,” according to co-star Christian Bale. The method actor and Oscar winner decided not to go hard at the gym for his role as Gorr the God Butcher in Marvel’s “Thor: Love and Thunder.” The 48-year-old explained that he didn’t see a reason to beef up because he didn’t want his physique compared to Hemsworth’s. “There’s no point in working out at all because you can’t compete with Chris,” Bale told the Wrap in a recent interview about the fourth installment of the superhero franchise. Hemsworth, 38, is known for his strict workout regimen that earned him worthy of the role as Thor, God of Thunder. Meanwhile, the “Batman” alum made a different kind of transformation for his supervillain character, wearing white and gray paint and shaving his head. Director Taika Waititi helped him prepare for the role by supplying him with Thor comic books featuring Gorr, Bale said during the interview — admitting he was shocked by the god’s revealing attire. “I did have a look briefly and said, ‘He’s got a G-string on. Nobody wants to see me like that,’ ” Bale teased. “He was also crazy musclebound in the comics. And I was in the middle of making another film where I was really quite skinny. Dude, nobody wants to see me in a G-string.” As for the Australian actor, he wolfed down eight meals a day to prepare for the part, training with Luke Zocchi and stuntman Bobby Holland Hanton. They shared with Page Six what it took to get the “Rush” star into shape for “Thor: Love and Thunder.” “Chris takes it very, very seriously, and the shape he gets into, it’s phenomenal,” Hanton divulged. “There’s a real process that goes into achieving these goals. But I think over the last 10 years, we’ve managed to come up with ways to do that.” Zocchi explained that Hemsworth’s body all comes down to “consistency, hard work and also eating the right foods.”
