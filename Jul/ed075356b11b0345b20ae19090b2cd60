LOS ANGELES — Mets All-Star closer Edwin Diaz, yet another free agent after the year, said he likes it in New York. “I would love to stay [a Met],” he said. Diaz has turned out to be a great pickup for the Mets, and actually out-pitched All-Star closers Josh Hader and Yankees upstart Clay Holmes to this point. He’s striking out batters at an incredible rate. “My mindset is to pitch to contact,” Diaz said. I told him if that’s true he’s failing. “If I’m ahead in the count, then I go for the contact 100 percent,” Diaz responded. I told Diaz I love his entrance song (“Narco,” by Masterjaxx and Timmy Trumpet), but wondered whether Mr. and Mrs. Met were really playing those instruments when his song blared. “I think they’re faking it,” Diaz said. “But you’ll have to ask Mr. Met.” Dodgers All-Star Tony Gonsolin isn’t complaining Clayton Kershaw got the nod to start the All-Star Game. “He’s a Dodger legend,” Gonsolin said. Kyle Schwarber said he was particularly looking forward to facing the legendary Albert Pujols in the first round of Monday night’s Home Run Derby. Pujols defeated Schwarber 20-19. “I grew up in Cincinnati,” Schwarber said. “I watched him torment my Reds for many years.” Word is Michael Conforto has a good chance to sign with someone to be a hitter, perhaps for September. He can sign without the signing team losing a draft choice when the MLB draft ends Tuesday. White Sox All-Star shortstop Tim Anderson declined to discuss the Josh Donaldson “Jackie” comment. “We ain’t gonna talk about that,” he said colorfully.
