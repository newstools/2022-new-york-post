Happy Fourth! What better place to play on Independence Day than the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. Fireworks there on Sunday. The Reds got a rare win against the visiting Bravos. The Mets move in and Taijuan Walker (6-2, 2.72) takes his turn. His last turn was brilliant. Walker scattered four hits and shut out the Astros for 7 ¹/₃. Hunter Greene (3-9, 5.72) will be on the hill for the home team. The fireballing rookie has the tools but this has been a season of seasoning. Greene has given up 13 runs in his last 14 frames. Play 10 units on the Mets. Canadian clubbed! The Toronto Blue Jays had their wings clipped by the Rays. Final: 7-3. Tampa Bay hit three homers in a six-run fifth inning to put the game out of reach. However, Cleveland cut our losses by cutting down the Yankees 2-0. Tristan McKenzie with his BEST. START. EVER., one-hitting the Bombers over seven strong innings. Split but we lost ground. Up +1,509 cherrybombs.
