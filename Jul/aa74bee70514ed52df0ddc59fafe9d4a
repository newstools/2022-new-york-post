A sheriff’s deputy whose daughter was killed during the mass shooting in Uvalde could be seen on video as other officers prevented him from storming the classroom. Felix Rubio wiped away tears from his face and clasped his hand over his mouth as gunman Salvatore Ramos committed the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, according to the footage first obtained by the Austin-American Statesman. The deputy — whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was inside the classroom — stood helpless in the school’s hallway as heavily armed officers neglected to engage the gunman at any point during the 77-minute long rampage on May 24. “I get to the building where — I see where everybody’s posted: In front of my baby girl’s two doors,” Rubio told reporters after the shooting. One officer can be seen grabbing Rubio’s shirt and holding him back as a Border Patrol tactical team finally breach the classroom. By that point, 19 children and two adults were shot dead inside. The footage was the latest damaging portrayal of the pathetic attempt by Uvalde police to prevent children from being killed in one of the worst school shootings in the nation’s history.
