Reader Rich Rutigliano on our Juan Soto selection in the Demolition, uhhh, Home Run Derby. “Thanks for the winner! The hell with the idiots! +600! Count it! Put it in the books! One unit. Something!” The Rich get Richer, Rich. And from Ed “Farmer” Ryan, New Jersey: “C’mon Stitches. What are you doing? Stop beating the Yankees!”  Winner, winner, chicken dinner, Farmer Ed. The Phillies, after taking two of three from the Bravos, head to Pittsburgh. Zack Wheeler (8-5, 2.78 ERA) tossed a three-hit, one-run gem at the Cubs in his last start. The Pirates’ Zach Thompson (3-7, 4.64) allowed the Marlins to score seven in his latest and is 0-3 in his last six starts. Play 20 units on Philly. Oh c’mon, are Yu kidding me? Darvish was good (two runs over seven) but the Tigers were down to their last out when Victor Reyes knocked in two runs and handed us, as well as the Padres, a gut-wrenching defeat. Final 4-3. Loss takes us to +1,890 caminitis.
