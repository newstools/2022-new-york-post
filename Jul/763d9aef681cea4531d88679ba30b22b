Two teams vying for the AL Central crown meet on Monday when the first-place Minnesota Twins travel to Chicago to take on the White Sox. Minnesota is expected to start Dylan Bundy (4-4, 4.71 ERA) with the Sox turning to Johnny Cueto (2-4, 3.33 ERA). Despite a losing record, Cueto has pitched pretty well for Chicago this season, allowing more than three earned runs just once in nine starts. The Sox are 4-5 with Cueto on the mound but a lot of that has been a lack of run support. In those five losses, Chicago has scored a total of 11 runs, with six coming in one game. Bundy has struggled at times this season but he’s looked good in his last three starts, giving up a total of four earned runs in 19 innings of work. However, betting against the Twins with Bundy on the mound has been money this year. Minnesota has lost nine of Bundy’s last 10 starts. Also, current White Sox hitters have had success against Bundy, hitting .289 in 73 career plate appearances. Cueto hasn’t gotten a ton of help from his offense, but I like the way he’s pitching overall. And while Bundy has been effective recently, he’s given up four runs or more five times already this season.   I think Chicago’s bats will get to the inconsistent Bundy early, and the game will fall on a Minnesota bullpen that entered Sunday ranked 10th in the AL with a 3.84 ERA. I’ll side with the better starting pitcher and back the White Sox at home. White Sox +110 (BetMGM)
