The Knicks could potentially face punishment from the NBA for tampering after they signed former Mavericks point guard Jalen Brunson. According to The Athletic, people around the league “expect the Knicks to get dinged for tampering” after signing the 25-year-old Brunson to a four-year, $104 million contract. Multiple reports surfaced days before the June 30, 6 p.m. start time for NBA free agency indicating Brunson intended to sign with the Knicks. That, along with William Wesley appearing courtside for one of the Mavericks’ playoff games against the Jazz, has left the Mavericks “quite frustrated,” according to The Athletic. The NBA docked the Bulls and Heat their next available second-round pick for their signings last year of Lonzo Ball and Kyle Lowry, respectively, after an investigation found both teams engaged in early contact with the players. There were other free-agent deals reported right at or shortly after 6 p.m. last Thursday that were obviously negotiated beforehand, including PJ Tucker signing with the 76ers and Malik Monk joining the Kings.
