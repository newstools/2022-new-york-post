LAS VEGAS — The best thing that can be said about a player at the NBA summer league is that he doesn’t belong there. Such a player stands out too much. He has reached a point at which he should be sitting on the sidelines with designer sunglasses next to the established players who come to Las Vegas to party and take in a few games. That was how it felt watching Quentin Grimes over the Knicks’ first three games. The second-year guard talked a big game about dominating in the days leading up to the glorified, nationally televised scrimmages. He backed up his words — and not just by knocking down jumpers. Grimes was the total package, incorporating playmaking into his 3-and-D skill-set. The Knicks were at their best when he was on the floor, outscoring their three opponents by 39 points. Grimes did much more than just score, although he did that at an elite level, averaging 24 points on 46.1 percent shooting. He distributed (4.3 assists). He attacked the basket. He defended and rebounded (4.0). Grimes, the 25th-overall pick in the 2021 draft, looked ready to force coach Tom Thibodeau into giving him a major role next season. Grimes certainly won’t be returning to Las Vegas next summer — unless he wants to watch a few games. A few other takeaways from summer league:
