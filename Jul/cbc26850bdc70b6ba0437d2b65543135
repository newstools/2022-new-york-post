The boat that capsized in the Hudson River, fatally trapping a 7-year-old boy and 50-year-old woman underneath, is a Yamaha AR240 named Stimulus Money that was docked out of the Jersey Shore. The blue and white 2020 model jet boat, which is registered in Waretown, New Jersey, according to police records, is a high-performance craft that can reach 30 mph in 4.3 seconds and is capable of nearly 52 mph, according to boattest.com. It’s not immediately clear how the boat got its name or if the owner purchased it using stimulus checks issued by former President Donald Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday afternoon, a group of at least 12 were onboard the 24-foot-long pleasure vessel for a chartered trip with family and friends when it capsized around 2:45 p.m., fatally trapping Julian Vasquez, 7, and Lindelia Vasquez, 50, underneath. Three others were left in critical condition from the incident. Their present conditions are not immediately clear. The vessel, which is built for water sports, costs about $59,000 and can hold 12 passengers with a weight limit of 2,698 pounds, according to a listing on Hardcore Marine. It’s outfitted with a removable dinette table, hinged seat cushions, drink holders, an adjustable captain’s chair, a touchscreen navigation system, speakers and Bluetooth capabilities. The model that capsized has a standard compass, depth finder, electronic speedometer, and fuel management system. Additional reporting by Joe Marino
