The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit celebrations continued for Camille Kostek and Christen Harper on Saturday. The models hit the catwalk for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit’s runway show as part of Miami Swim Week, where they sported an array of swimwear, including one-pieces and two-piece sets. The runway show took place just weeks after Kostek and Harper, who are the significant others of NFL stars Rob Gronkowski and Jared Goff, respectively, unveiled their stunning photo shoots from this year’s edition of the iconic magazine. Kostek, who appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit in 2019, was photographed for 2022 in St. Croix, a locale that holds a special place in her heart. “Shooting in St. Croix this year for the destination is like my world’s colliding because my mom’s actually from the [US] Virgin Islands and my mom’s sister Camille, who I’m named after, still lives out in the Virgin Islands,” Kostek told The Post in June. For the shoot itself, Kostek posed aboard a boat — which wasn’t without challenges. “There were times when there was a big gust of wind and the waters were a little rocky, but it was a challenge and I was up for it and knew it would make a memorable shoot, and the photos are probably some of my favorites that I’ve ever done,” the “Dancing With Myself” host shared. Harper, a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie, shot in Barbados for the issue and gave fans a behind-the-scenes peek in June on Instagram. It’s been quite a life-changing summer for Harper, who announced her engagement to Lions quarterback Goff in June. The couple, first linked in early 2019, celebrated the moment with a sunset dinner on the beach. “6.16.22 can’t wait for forever with you,” Harper gushed on Instagram at the time, while Goff — who is gearing up for his second year with the Lions after being traded by the Rams — wrote, “I’m the luckiest guy in the world because I get to spend forever with you.”
