The Yankees are unlikely to continue pursuing a trade for Andrew Benintendi, the Royals’ All-Star left fielder, because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, The Post’s Jon Heyman reports. Benintendi, 28, is one of 10 Royals players not making the trip to Toronto for a four-game series against the Blue Jays that starts Thursday night. Those players are not allowed to enter Canada because of their vaccination status. The Yankees, who had a fully vaccinated roster when they went to Toronto in early May and mid-June, have one more trip to Canada remaining: a three-game series against the Blue Jays on Sept. 26-28. The Yankees have a 14-game lead in the AL East, while the Blue Jays are tied with the Red Sox and Mariners for the final two wild-card spots. The Mets have not ruled out a Benintendi pursuit, Heyman reports. They’re not as concerned about Benintendi’s vaccination status because they do not make a trip to Toronto this season. The Royals previously informed teams pursuing Benintendi that he was unvaccinated, Heyman reports. The Blue Jays are among the teams still discussing a trade for him, as they hope there’s a chance he would get vaccinated if dealt to Toronto. Benintendi was named to his first MLB All-Star Game this year. He’s hitting .317 with a .786 OPS, three homers, and 37 RBIs in 87 games. The Yankees brought back utilityman Tyler Wade on Thursday in a trade with the Angels.
