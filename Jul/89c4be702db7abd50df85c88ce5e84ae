Two Michigan school officials who met with accused gunman Ethan Crumbley hours before his killing spree were placed on leave for more than a month after the November shooting. Dean of Students Nicholas Ejak and Counselor Shawn Hopkins have both since left Oxford high School, but will continue to work in the district, according to media reports. The two are named in a pair of civil lawsuits filed by attorney Ven Johnson against the district, on behalf of six students and families victimized by the shooting. The lawyer claimed the district “covered up” its role in the shooting by putting the two on leave. Crumbley, now 16, was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting, and his parents were charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly making a firearm accessible to their son. The lawsuits accuse Crumbley, his parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley; and school staff including Ejak and Hopkins, of negligence. Johnson said the suspensions prove the school district “has no interest whatsoever in determining the mistakes it made that left four students dead, seven injured and hundreds traumatized.” Ejak and Hopkins both met with Crumbley and his parents to discuss sinister drawings he’d made just a few hours before he shot up the school, the county prosecutor said. Crumbley allegedly claimed the drawings were for a video game and his parents refused to take him home, the prosecutor said. Tate Myre, 16; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Justin Shilling, 17, died in the tragic shooting. The drawings reportedly came with the inscription: “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.”
