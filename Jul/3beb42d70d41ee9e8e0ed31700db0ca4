Newest Knick Isaiah Hartenstein and his fiancée Kourtney Kellar are on cloud nine after getting engaged during the offseason. Hartenstein, 24, proposed to the Los Angeles-based model on the beach in Malibu in April, just a week after his season with the Clippers ended, with a stunning oval-shaped diamond ring. Kellar, 31, announced the news in a post on her Instagram page, with a message written in her fiancée’s second language of German, that translated in English to, “Of course I said ‘yes.'” Hartenstein’s name became a hot one this week, with the Knicks eventually beating out the Bulls and Magic to secure the 7-footer’s services. As the NBA star and his wife-to-be look forward to their impending nuptials, get to know Kellar, who’s a star in her own right. Kellar began dating Hartenstein in Feb. 2019, after she ended her engagement to country singer Chase Bryant. The longtime couple live together with their dog, Oui, in Los Angeles, where she is signed to Lipps LA modeling agency. Kellar is also signed with Select Model Management in Miami. Kellar — a Texas native, who won the 2017 Miss Texas International title — has worked with brands including Maxim magazine, Guess and Fashion Nova. She got her start in modeling at the age of 14, when she was approached by Varsity, a brand of cheerleading uniforms. The blonde beauty has modeled activewear, swimsuits and lingerie, in which she covered the July/August 2021 issue of Cigar Snob magazine in a lace bra and underwear with thigh-high stockings. Kellar is also a runway staple at Miami Swim Week. Kellar is a popular fixture on social media, and boasts nearly 700,000 Instagram followers and 400,000 followers on TikTok. The social media influencer often documents her modeling journey, and features Hartenstein in her posts — including a TikTok video earlier this month, in which she tried to train him in how to take her modeling polaroids.
