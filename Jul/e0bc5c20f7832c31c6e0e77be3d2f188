An influencer has claimed she was kicked out of a US supermarket for being “hot” and wearing revealing clothing. Brazilian woman Iara Ferreira said she was shopping in Miami when a supermarket employee approached her and asked the content creator to leave the store. She claimed he recognized her from her OnlyFans account, and he assumed she would be showing off in the store and filming it. Iara said she was alone in the supermarket, which she didn’t name, and didn’t reveal what she was wearing at the time — adding she believed she was kicked out for being “hot.” “I felt humiliated, I was in shock when he took me out of the market screaming. My look was not scandalous. I wear it in Brazil, on a daily basis, and I never went through that,” she told a UK publication. “The employee accused me of something I didn’t do. For me it’s prejudice just because I’m hot. “I’ve recorded in public, but always in a discreet way, without embarrassing other people.” Iara said it’s not the first time she has been shamed for her work. She said once she was on a beach wearing a thong swimsuit while in Brazil when she was approached by three women who called her “clueless” and asked her if she sold “nude photos.” It’s not the first time someone has been removed from a location because of their clothing being deemed “inappropriate.” A UK woman was once told on a flight from Birmingham to Tenerife that the plane would not take off until she covered up her low-cut top because it was “causing offense.” She said she obeyed but was told if she didn’t she would be removed from the flight.
