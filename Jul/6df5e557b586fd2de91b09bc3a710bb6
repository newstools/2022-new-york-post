The husband of a Connecticut woman who strangled her three children in a shocking murder-suicide “fainted to the ground” after discovering his kids’ bodies, neighbors said. Sonia Loja, 36, allegedly killed her three children – ages 12, 10 and 5 – inside her Danbury home on Wednesday, then hanged herself in a shed in the backyard. The bodies were found after husband Pedro Panjon asked for a wellness check because he hadn’t heard from his wife all day, neighbors said. “He called the cops and asked them to do a wellness check and then he came here and he beat the cops here,” neighbor Elvis Espinal told The Post on Thursday. “So he went inside and like a couple minutes later he came out and he called 911 and just fainted to the ground.” Danbury police later found Loja hanging in the shed, neighbors said. “What was she thinking?” said one neighbor, whose property abuts the home. The family had been there four or five years and were “quiet,” he added. “So yeah, we’d say ‘Hi’ and wave but they kept to themselves,” he said. “They had parties on the weekends, picnics. Just family. They kept the yard nice, they built that shed.” Espinal said Loja did not show any signs of emotional distress. “She was even tempered. My mom even said, she never noticed anything abnormal about her,” he said. “She was always nice to me. No attitude or anything. The kids were always very friendly well behaved.” Danbury police had said in a news release that neither of the other residents of the home were there when they arrived, but Chief Patrick Ridenhour told the New Haven Register on Wednesday cops arrived around 6:30 p.m. after a call for a welfare check from what the newspaper described as “distraught and crying” man. Panjon posted photos of Loja and their three children on social media after the killing and shared a black ribbon with a Spanish phrase that translates to “Rest in Peace, now you are in a better place with God.”
