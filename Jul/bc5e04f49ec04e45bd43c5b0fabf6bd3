The ability draws you in, but the grace under pressure may be the most impressive part of Druw Jones’ game. The son of Andruw Jones can do a lot on a baseball field, just like his father could. Andruw, with 10 Gold Gloves to his name as one of the best center fielders ever to play the game, seemed more to glide than sprint before running down a flyball, a skill that has proven hereditary. Druw is regarded as a five-tool prospect with similarly phenomenal defensive skills, lightning speed and a quick, righty bat that has destroyed Georgia high school pitching. Jones, the possible No. 1 pick in Sunday’s first-year player draft, carries every skill major league clubs want, including — and perhaps especially — the more subtle ones. A person and player with his pedigree needs to handle pressure well, and Jones repeatedly, and virally, has shut up several opposing crowds without saying a word. The first time a high school fan base tried to get in his head was March 2, when he stepped to the plate against Decatur’s Brady Jones — who throws low-90s and is committed to Georgia State — and against a crowd that knew who was in the batter’s box.
