Morgan Riddle was royally inspired for her latest Wimbledon look. Riddle, the fashion influencer girlfriend of American tennis ace Taylor Fritz, channeled Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, on Wednesday for the world No. 14’s quarterfinals match against Rafael Nadal, wearing a white dress with matching heels and accessories. “My boyfriend is playing Centre Court at Wimbledon today. It’s quarterfinals at Centre Court and is very classy. You’re going to recreate a Kate Middleton look,” Riddle said in a TikTok video. Middleton, 40, an avid tennis fan, attended Wimbledon on Tuesday with husband Prince William, wearing a blue polka-dot dress by Alessandra Rich. As Riddle noted in her TikTok, the Duchess of Cambridge has frequently worn white ensembles to matches over the years, which ultimately served as her inspiration for Wednesday. “Historically, she’s worn a lot of white dresses to matches, so that’s what we’re going to do,” Riddle said before giving her followers a glimpse at her outfit. Both Riddle and Fritz stunned at Centre Court on Wednesday, when the 24-year-old athlete put up a fight in a five-set thriller against Nadal, 36. The 22-time Grand Slam winner outdueled Fritz, however, advancing to Friday’s semifinals against Nick Kyrgios. Riddle, who has been dating Fritz for two years, later congratulated her beau following his impressive run. “What a week! So proud of you @taylorfritz,” Riddle wrote Wednesday in an Instagram Story. “Til next time.” Fritz previously topped Nadal at Indian Wells back in March, later celebrating with Riddle on the court.
