A tourist’s trip to a zoo got intimate real fast when an orangutan fondled and kissed her in a moment captured on video. The woman was visiting Safari World in Bangkok in late June when the frisky animal got a little handsy and copped a feel. In a video, the primate can be seen grabbing her breasts and even giving her a kiss on the cheek when she was attempting to pose for a photo. The woman was sitting down on a swing at the zoo ready for a sweet touristy snap when the cheeky ape comes up behind her and paws at her, cupping her breasts before giving her several attempted kisses on her cheek. The ape grins wildly as people take photos and film the interaction. The woman — albeit surprised — giggles as the orangutan continues to kiss her cheek. Orangutans are closely related to humans, having 97% of DNA in common, according to the Orangutan Project. They’re great apes, as opposed to monkeys. According to WWF, orangutans are found only in the rainforests of the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra. They live in tropical forests and prefer river valleys and floodplains of their respective islands and spend nearly their entire lives in trees.
