Jackson Mahomes returned to TikTok after a near two-month hiatus, and some fans aren’t sure what to make of his latest post. The younger brother of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes — who is known for his viral dance videos and bold social media content — discussed his “craziest sex experience” in a new video posted to his verified TikTok account on Sunday. “We were f–king like three months ago and…” Mahomes said while pointing to an unnamed brunette, with his arm around her. She was quick to cut off Mahomes’ claim, saying, “No” directly into the camera. It’s unclear what Mahomes’ relationship with the woman is, and whether or not the clip was meant to be a joke or a parody of another viral internet moment. “POV: random girl stay lying at the club,” Mahomes wrote in his caption, adding the hashtag, “blaneoh.” The person in the video that asked Mahomes and the brunette their “craziest sex experience” posted the video to their popular TikTok account with the username: “Most Approved.” On Monday, Mahomes took to Instagram to share a video of himself lip-syncing sexual lyrics to the song “Swim” by Chase Atlantic. Mahomes has been quiet on his social media platforms since May. A few months prior, Mahomes reportedly complained in March about “the media destroying [his] life.” That came shortly after Mahomes was called out by a business on TikTok for allegedly scamming the company. The latter followed a separate social media snafu when Mahomes was ripped by a Kansas City bar, which claimed in a December social media post that he acted entitled and was rude to staffers at the establishment.
