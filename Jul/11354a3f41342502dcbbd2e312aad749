Some people listen to music, but others like to experience it. It’s the difference between throwing on any old pair of headphones or researching which ones will truly immerse you in a song, or playing an old scratched CD vs listening to a vinyl that still sounds like when it was first pressed. You may have your own collection of old records, or you may have thought of starting one, but quality turntables usually cost a lot. That is, unless you get the mbeat® PT-18K Bluetooth Vinyl Player. This affordable turntable has all the essential components for an authentic analog listening experience, and from now through July 31st, it’s only $224 (Reg. $363). This retro turntable sports a full-size metal alloy platter, produces reduced vibrations and signal disturbance, and it has a moving magnet cartridge for accurate tracking and cleaner sound. It also has some modern amenities that are just beyond convenient. You can connect your own wired speakers, or use your favorite bluetooth speakers. “Great value! I have been searching for a good quality turntable at a decent price point & I finally found it! Thank you!” writes one verified reviewer, and it’s easy to see why they’re excited. This turntable can play 33/45 PM, which covers most records you’ll find. It can also play vinyl with a speed variance of ±1%. If you have an old collection of records you want to preserve forever, you can even record directly to your computer and save the sound as audio files. Or if you just want to enjoy some tunes, the built-in preamplifier can produce some incredible sound quality. Whether you’re just getting into records and record players or have been at it for decades, this turntable is an exciting union between vintage and modern builds.
