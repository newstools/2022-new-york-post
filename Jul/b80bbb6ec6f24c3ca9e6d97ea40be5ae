Emmanuel Todd Lopez is ready for his close-up. A curious emu is taking over TikTok with his camera-stealing antics at Knuckle Bump Farms in South Florida. His caretaker, Taylor Blake, has gone viral with posts that document Blake’s attempts to record educational videos — only to have the star subjects interrupt the lessons time and time again. “Don’t do it, Emmanuel, don’t do it! Emmanuel Todd Lopez!” Blake exclaims as Emmanuel sticks his long neck into the frame. To Blake’s surprise, the emu seems to back down. “That brings me great joy in my soul that you listened.” Blake captioned the clip, “He knew I meant business when I whipped out his government name.” In another recent post with nearly 3 million views — captioned “Animals against education” — Blake can be seen talking to the camera as their free-range dwellers enter the scene and ruin the shot. “I can’t catch a break, guys — I’ve been trying to film this forever,” an exasperated Blake says the moment before Emmanuel’s sister Ellen enters the frame — head first as she stares down the lens of the camera before pecking it onto the muddy earth. “OK, guys, I’m just gonna be honest with you. I don’t think that I’m ever going to be able to educate you on anything because I don’t think that anybody on this farm is go— Regina!” yells Blake, referring to Emmanuel’s other sister, Regina. “I don’t even remember what I want to talk bout anymore,” Blake adds before ending the segment. Fans on the app are commiserating with the frustrated farm hand. “I swear it’s like you’re surrounded by a whole herd of toddlers,” commented one viewer. “Might not be educational but we did get a good laugh,” added another.
