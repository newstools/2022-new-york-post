An avid hunter of endangered animals was shot dead in South Africa after his truck broke down, according to new reports. Riaan Naude, the 55-year-old head of Pro Hunt Africa, was found dead next to his vehicle in Marken Road, Limpopo. Cops said they have no motive yet. Two hunting rifles were found in Naude’s car near the Kruger National Park wildlife reserve, local outlet Maroela Media reported June 9. The non-profit Heritage Protection Group said Naude was shot dead by a man who pulled up alongside him when the hunter stopped his car near Mokopane after it overheated, according to Metro UK. “His vehicle overheated & he was shot execution style next to the vehicle in Limpopo,” the Twitter account “XposeTrophyKilling” said in a post. The group said two men got out of a white Nissan pickup truck and that one shot him, the outlet reported. The man “shot him in cold blood at close range,” The Mirror reported. HPG said the pair snatched one of his guns and fled. A cattle herder heard a gunshot and witnessed a Nissan truck speeding away, according to reports. Cops confirmed that Naude — who frequently shared images of himself with animals that he killed while hunting — was shot dead, reports said. Police Lt. Col. Mamphaswa Seabi said cops found Naude’s dead body “lying with his face up” with “blood on his head and face,” according to multiple news outlets. “The motive for the attack and the subsequent murder is unknown at this stage,” he said. Naude’s company, based in northern South Africa, labels itself a “hunting and Eco Safari outfit.” “WE ARE YOUR AFRICAN DREAM!” the website boasts. The business charges $350 per day to hunt game, $2,500 for crocodile and $1,500 for a giraffe, according to Pro Hunt Africa’s price list.
