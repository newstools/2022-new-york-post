This was no Little League home run. Diamondbacks first-base prospect Leandro Cedeno mashed a monstrous home run on Saturday while playing for the Double-A Amarillo Sod Poodles, sending the ball a reported 527 feet. “Oh my god, that’s amazing, I never think I can hit a ball that far,” Cedeno said after the game, according to MLB.com. “I was for sure [it was a] homer. I stepped up to the plate like ‘Okay, I got that one,’ and I enjoyed the moment.” According to The Athletic, Cedeno’s homer is longer than any MLB home run that Statcast has tracked since 2015. While Cedeno, 23, isn’t ranked by MLB among the Diamondbacks’ top 30 prospects, he’s having a strong season in the Texas League. He has 18 home runs and 60 RBIs with a slash line of .303/.374/.545. The 527-foot solo blast tied the game 5-5 in the fifth inning, and the Sod Poodles went on to win their Christmas in July game 7-6 over the San Antonio Missions. The Sod Poodles wore jerseys resembling Christmas sweaters to mark the occasion.
