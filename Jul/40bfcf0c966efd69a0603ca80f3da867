Paige Spiranac had plenty to celebrate in South Beach over the weekend. On Saturday, the golfer-turned-influencer stepped out for Maxim’s Hot 100 experience at Hyde Beach in Miami, one month after the magazine dubbed her the “sexiest woman alive.” “Had so much fun at the @MaximMag hot 100 party last night!” Spiranac gushed Sunday on Twitter. “Still in shock to see my face on the cover!” Dressed in a revealing black ensemble that featured a bikini-like top and a see-through skirt, the 29-year-old Spiranac smiled on the red carpet as she posed beside her Maxim cover. Spiranac first announced in June that she’d be gracing the cover of Maxim, telling her 3.5 million Instagram followers at the time that she was “truly in disbelief” over the honor. “I am so honored by being named the sexiest woman alive by @maximmag this year! When I (found out) I kept asking them, ‘are you sure?’ because I was truly in disbelief,” Spiranac said of being notified. “To me being sexy is about confidence and feeling comfortable in your own skin. I’ve always tried to stay true to myself though out my unconventional path and now I’m so proud to be following so many amazing women who carried the title in years before me. Thank you again Maxim for this moment and to @gilles_bensimon for these beautiful pictures!” In addition to toasting to her Maxim cover, Spiranac also took a victory lap over the weekend after correctly picking Australia’s Cameron Smith to win the 150th British Open. “Congrats to Cam Smith for a historic win. And congrats to myself for picking him to win,” the “Playing A Round” podcast host tweeted Sunday. On Thursday, Spiranac revealed on Instagram that she picked Smith to win the British Open, joking she hoped her prediction “ages well come Sunday.” Smith edged out Rory McIlroy and Cameron Young to hoist the Claret Jug and capture his first major championship, with a brilliant 8-under 64 on Sunday.
