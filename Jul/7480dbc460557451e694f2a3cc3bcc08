Mike Trout may have to cope with a back injury for the rest of his career. The superstar outfielder has been sidelined since July 12 with left ribcage inflammation, an injury that is causing Trout back pain. Angels head athletic trainer Mike Frostad told The Athletic that Trout, 30, is dealing with a “pretty rare condition” in his back — costovertebral dysfunction at T5. “The doctor (Robert Watkins), who is one of the most well-known spine surgeons in the country — if not the world — doesn’t see a lot of these,” Frostad said. “And for it to happen in a baseball player, we just have to take into consideration what he puts himself through with hitting, swinging on a daily basis, just getting prepared. And then also playing in the outfield. … There’s so many things that can aggravate it. But this doctor hasn’t seen a lot of it.” Trout initially exited a game on July 12 with back spasms, and while he initially perceived the injury to be a short-term ailment, the pain has persisted. He received a cortisone shot on July 18 and has yet to resume baseball activities as he works his way towards a return. Frostad said that the 10-time All-Star is “upbeat” despite the news, also noting that Trout’s season is not yet in jeopardy. “I think he’s starting to feel like he’s getting the benefits,” Frostad said. “… But long-term, we do have to look at this as something that — he has to manage it, not just through the rest of this season, but also through the rest of his career, probably.” Trout’s sensational career has become an injury-riddled tale over the past few seasons. He played in just 36 games last year due to a torn calf muscle. He also endured stints on the injured list in 2017 (torn thumb ligament), 2018 (wrist inflammation) and 2019 (foot neuroma). Trout is hitting .270 with 24 home runs and a .967 OPS in 79 games this season for the fourth-place Angels.
