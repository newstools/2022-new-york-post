Talk about living the lavish life. New video footage appears to show Dustin Johnson and Pat Perez aboard LIV Golf’s luxury private jet, which includes a lounge area and a fully-stocked bar. Normally, players fly to tournaments on their own, but LIV Golf has been providing luxury travel to its tournaments. In the clip, shared to Instagram on Thursday by Zire Golf, Perez can be seen walking around, holding his cap while the song “We Are The Champions” plays. Perez was likely celebrating his $900,000 payday, despite shooting an 80 in the final round to finish T-29 at 8-over-par last weekend. But his team, which included Johnson, Patrick Reed and Talor Gooch, finished in first, which netted them $3 million split between the four players in the second tournament of the LIV Golf season at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in North Plains, Oregon. The 46-year-old pro signed a four-year deal to play with LIV Golf after more than 20 years on the PGA Tour, and said it was like “winning the lottery.” Perez also sported a collared shirt with $100 bills on it at LIV Golf’s welcome party prior to the tournament. Johnson, meanwhile, was filmed walking past Perez on the plane, while Brooks Koepka and others mingled by the bar and sat at dining tables. Johnson reportedly received $125 million to leave the PGA Tour for LIV. The aircraft, which features cream-colored interior, also includes snack tables and large screens on the back of each spacious seat.
