Early on Tuesday, a trailer for the latest episode of “The Shop” showed LeBron James saying that he isn’t sure he would come back to the U.S. if he was Brittney Griner. Now, he is backtracking those comments on Twitter. James notably said in the clip: “She’s been there over 110 days. Now, how could she feel like America has her back? I would be feeling like, ‘Do I even want to go back to America?’” The full episode will be released Friday, so no further context could be provided on the statement before James spoke out Tuesday evening. The Lakers star now claims he “wasn’t knocking our beautiful country” with his comments on the show. James tweeted that his comments weren’t a shot at the the U.S., but rather was sympathizing with Griner. “I was simply saying how she’s probably feeling emotionally along with so many other emotions, thoughts, etc inside that cage she’s been in for over 100+ days,” James tweeted. James finished off his tweet with #BringHerHome, the tag fans have been using to bring awareness to Griner’s situation. Griner has been in Russian custody since February for possessing cannabis vape cartridges. She recently pled guilty to the charge, but the U.S. State Department is arguing she was wrongfully accused.
