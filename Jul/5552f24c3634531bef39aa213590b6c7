If you’re already afraid of the ocean, this footage of a great white shark in Australia will scare the crap out of you. In a clip for “Mega Predators of Oz” — which was shown on the Discovery Channel on Monday night as part of its “Shark Week” viewing — a diver is left with a face full of feces straight from a great white shark. In the 3-second clip, the shark swims near the divers, letting out a great big poo. In the special, Dr. Charlie Huveneers and his team of biologists were trying to get a sample of the giant shark’s feces. The scientists wanted to help track how a great white could have been responsible for a half-eaten mako shark found in South Australia. Great whites can grow to 20 feet long and weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. They’re carnivores, meaning they only eat meat, with their diets consisting of seals, sea lions, dolphins and fish, among other animals. “Shark Week,” now in its 34th year, will air specials on the Discovery Channel (and streaming on discovery+) until Saturday.
