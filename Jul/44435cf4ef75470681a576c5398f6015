Meghan Markle came to the rescue during an appearance at the United Nations on Monday. The Duchess of Sussex, 40, handed a woman, who was coughing up a storm, a bottle of water in an effort to curb the huffs. Markle and her husband Prince Harry attended the UN for Nelson Mandela International Day on the Upper East Side, where the latter royal was giving a speech. During the event, a woman who was seated behind the couple began to cough and Markle turned around and handed her some H2O. The kind moment was shared across social media with many fans praising Markle for her goodwill. One pointed out: “To offer your bottle of water to another woman who is coughing tells me more of Duchess Meghan’s character, than any hit piece book written about her.” “Meghan giving her bottle of water to the lady behind her. Always kind a[nd] caring,” a fan said. Another noted: “That’s our gal never misses a beat. Always aware of her surroundings and will help if needed.” One added, “It all just comes natural to them…looking after and looking out for each other, such an amazing couple.” “WOW What a hero haha,” tweeted another. However, some were concerned for Markle, given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “How unhygienic! Has markle ever heard of covid?” one person said. During his keynote address, the Duke of Sussex, 37, revealed the moment he knew the “Suits” alum was his “soulmate.” “Since I first visited Africa at 13 years old, I’ve always found hope on the continent,” he said, calling the place his “lifeline” where he’s “found peace and healing time and time again.” “It’s where I felt closest to my mother and sought solace after she died,” he continued. “And where I knew I’d found a soulmate in my wife.” The lovebirds visited Africa twice when they were dating and once after they were married. Markle and the Invictus Games founder traveled to Botswana after they began dating in July 2016 and later returned the following August to celebrate her 36th birthday.
