A Bronx man was arrested for the deadly assault and robbery of a 51-year-old neighborhood resident, police said. Nickoles Rodriguez, 24, was collared by cops Friday afternoon and charged with murder and robbery in connection with the June 25 incident, authorities said. Police that day responded to a robbery call in front of 130 West 230th St. at around 6:15 a.m. and found the 51-year-old lying on the ground, unconscious, with face and head wounds, cops said. The “unresponsive” victim, Pedro Rodriguez, of the Bronx, was taken to Saint Barnabas Hospital, where he died from his injuries on July 2, the NYPD said. It’s not yet clear if the two men were related. At the time of the attack, three unidentified males were see getting out of a maroon Kia Optima, with a New Jersey lisense plate number D19-NWB and walking toward where the victim was standing, police said. A short time later, the trio re-entered the vehicle and drove away. “The investigation remains ongoing,” the NYPD said on Saturday. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
