One episode of “Pawn Stars” has a championship feel to it. Former Alabama running back Keilan Robinson’s 2020 championship rings are listed for sale by a Las Vegas pawn shop for $60,000, according to ESPN. The rings — which include the SEC title, Rose Bowl victory and College Football Playoff championship — are being pawned at Gold & Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, home of the hit TV show “Pawn Stars.” A man named Jon on the show brought the rings into the shop, according to the report, claiming he received them from his uncle. It’s unclear how the family got possession of the rings. Robinson rushed for 254 yards and two touchdowns as a freshman in 2019, but opted out during the COVID-impacted 2020 season — the season for which his rings represent. He was given a ring despite not appearing in any games. Robinson transferred to Texas last season, where he rushed for 322 yards and three touchdowns. If Robinson indeed sold his rings, it would represent a feature newly available to college athletes through NIL, allowing them to profit off of merchandise. Robinson will face his old team on Sept. 10, when Texas hosts Alabama in Austin.
