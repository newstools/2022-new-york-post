It’s true — online shopping has redefined the fashion landscape. Though in-person days at shopping malls aren’t obsolete just yet, the typical experience is as follows: touch something in store, try it on in a curtained dressing room, tell store clerk you’re going to “think about it” and then look up comparable (sometimes more affordable, too) options from other retailers. Luckily, Amazon serves as a one-stop shop to snag every stylish find your wardrobe is seeking. Even better, a team of influencers and bloggers share their love for unique Amazon finds (including photos of themselves modeling the outfit for their Instagram feeds) on the retailer’s specially curated “Found It On Amazon” section. More commonly dubbed as #FoundItOnAmazon, the page makes it easier to locate bestselling items and shop on social. What’s included? An unending catalog of beautiful wide-leg pants, all kinds of dresses under $50 and more. Every fashion item is much better to shop when someone in real life recommends it (as well as posting with it) for that full-picture overview that doubles as styling inspo. To help sort through one of our favorite pages, we cherry-picked 12 best styles below. Now, you can post on Instagram, too — you #FoundItOnAmazon and are looking #Fabulous for summer. Oh, we’re all about the cute summertime look. Zesica’s Bohemian Floral-Printed Maxi Dress is one to steal for $30, especially when styled with one of Whippy’s Woven Elastic Stretch Belt ($17 for a four-pack) and the on-trend Vintga Bamboo Handbag ($39), as chosen by influencer Lyndi Ma. Whether you’re off to an evening dinner or gearing up for a vacation, this look is serving us all the good vibes. Amoretu’s Tunic V-Neck Shift Dress doubles as a lovely work dress and dynamite find under $50. Its flowy, fun-patterned nature pairs well with a classic pair of clear heels, too, and its long-sleeved design is great for days you don’t want to wear a jacket. SHEIN’s Puff-Sleeve Pullover Blouse is one of the best practical finds we discovered on #FoundItOnAmazon — and for a good reason. It’s a great piece to transition into fall in (yes, we’re just about there!) and its textured look is like no other. With some fabulous Amazon jewelry, you’ll be on your way in style. Hold the phone — Freeprance’s Trouser Paperbag Pants are simply too chic to pass up. We love paperbag pants, especially, as they’re great to pair with some chic shoes and accessories. Creator of Queen of Sleeves paired this look with Dream Pairs’ Kucci Pumps ($24) and GAMT’s Oversized Square Sunglasses ($14) to take her day out on the town in a fashion-forward way. Your new pair of biker shorts has been unlocked. Suukess’ Cross Workout Shorts with Pockets is a flattering pair of bottoms that has that crossover detail we all know and love. For a complete look, pair the athleisure fit with a pair of some of the best white sneakers we rounded up. Ok, we don’t want to choose favorites here (all of these styles are add-to-cart-worthy!) but R.Vivimo’s V-Neck Cotton Beach Dress is the salsa girl emoji IRL. We love the purple and blue hues this flowy number has within its pattern. Oh, and if you want to romanticize your evening in this gorgeous style, pick up Elixir Glassware’s Edge Wine Glass (now $27 for a two-pack) — the same one influencer Alex is holding! When it comes to women’s jeans, you can’t go wrong with a pair of classic Levi’s. This coveted light-wash pair is fairly priced and is versatile to dress up or down. Not to mention, it looks great when styled exactly how influencer Hannah pieced it together — with SupreLook’s Casual Crew Neck ($20), Planone’s Short Waterproof Rain Boots ($40) and an Adidas Cap ($26) to complete the relaxed #OOTD. We found the perfect night-out top. A simplistic tank with a flattering criss-cross halter neck, Floerns’ less-than-$20 top is one to add to your shopping cart now. Oh, and if you’re concerned about what kind of bra to wear, not to worry — this influencer wore the top with Nippies ($26), Amazon’s best-selling silicone pasties with nearly 20K rave reviews. If you’re searching for that high-quality pair of sneaks that won’t become dirty too quickly, Adidas’ Cloudfoam QT Racer Running Shoe is the black-embossed pair waiting for you. Creator of The Brave Woman Shop on Amazon paired this with Gym People’s best-selling Padded Workout Tank Top ($22 and one of our personal favorites) and Seaur’s Zip-Up Lightweight Crop Jacket ($30). If you’re wondering about the cool pretty-in-pink leggings she’s wearing, too, you’re not the only one. Pick up Colorfulkoala’s High-Rise Tie-Dye Leggings ($30) to complete the look. Welcome in warm and cool weather alike with PrettyGarden’s Floral Tunic Blouse. The allover speckled pattern is one of the most unique we found on Amazon, too, and it looks great with Kan Can’s Skinny Jeans ($57) and Glitzall’s Dumpling Clutch ($31) — exactly what influencer Merilee paired it with for her outdoor adventure. Drop (and stop) what you’re doing to pick up these perfect Braided Heeled Open-Toe Sandals. They’re available in a slew of colors, have that double-band, open-back detailing we can’t get enough of and will soon become your most-worn shoes (we can bet on it). For the head-to-toe look, pick up FancyInn’s Two-Piece Jumpsuit ($31) — the summertime fit influencer Brooke is sporting — to style for any summer soiree on your calendar. Perfect for all-year-round wear, Koolaburra by UGG has the plushest, cloud-like Fuzz’n Slipper that (1) makes a wonderful gift for anyone and (2) you’ll soon be wearing all-around your house. Its breathable yet soft design is one not many slippers have, so pick it up ASAP to make getting out of bed in the morning that much more enjoyable.
