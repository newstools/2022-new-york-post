The Collin County Medical Examiner’s office has determined former Dallas Cowboys running back Marion Barber III died of a heat stroke, according to multiple reports. Barber was found dead inside his apartment in Frisco, Texas, on June 1. He was 38. Across seven seasons in the NFL, Barber notched 4,780 rushing yards and 59 total touchdowns. Barber, a Pro Bowler in 2007, played for Dallas from 2005-10 and finished his career with the Bears in 2011. “We are heartbroken by the tragic death of Marion Barber III,” the Cowboys wrote in a statement on June 1. “Marion was an old-school, hard-nosed football player who ran with the will to win every down. He had a passion for the game and love for his coaches and teammates. Our hearts go out to Marion’s family and friends during this difficult time.” Barber’s father, Marion Barber II, said in June that the condition of Barber’s body had complicated the investigation, though the officials had ruled out foul play and trauma.
