Chilling surveillance videos captured the events that led to a deadly confrontation between a Manhattan bodega clerk and his assailant earlier this month. The first clip, released by the NYPD on July 5, showed ex-con Martin Simon, 35, shoving store clerk Jose Alba, 61, against the wall after the younger man walked behind the register of the Blue Moon convenience store in Hamilton Heights on July 1. Police say Simon attacked Alba after the 35-year-old man’s girlfriend got into an argument with the clerk because she couldn’t pay for a bag of chips. The footage showed Alba attempting to walk away from Simon after being shoved, then plunging a knife into his neck and torso repeatedly as the two wrestled with each other. Alba has insisted he stabbed Simon out of self-defense, but he was still charged with murder, angering supporters including Mayor Adams. On Saturday, new video was released that showed Alba attempting to avoid a confrontation with Simon moments before the stabbing. “Papa, I don’t want a problem, papa,” Alba is heard telling Simon as he walks behind the counter. As Simon approaches Alba, he’s heard demanding: “What’s up with you? N—-r, what is wrong with you?” The fatal stabbing happens moments later. On Sunday, The Post obtained more footage from a different angle that showed the moment Alba was apparently slashed by Simon’s girlfriend as he stabbed her beau. The footage appeared to show Simon’s gal pal pulling a knife from her purse, attempting to grab Alba’s arm and then stabbing him. The footage showed Simon lying at the back of the register in a pool of blood while Alba is seen in the background still holding the bloody knife. At one point, the girlfriend is seen crying and apparently trying to revive Simon. Alba broke his silence over the incident on Monday and told The Post he is deeply sorry and regretful over his actions.
