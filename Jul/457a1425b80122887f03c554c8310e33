New footage shows the trio who cops believe accosted a flashy Brooklyn bishop and snatched up more than $1 million in jewelry during a live-streamed church service. The footage, released late Thursday and marked with a timestamp of Sunday around 11:05 a.m. – minutes before the heist at the Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries – shows the three suspects walking on the sidewalk with their hoods pulled up and their faces covered. Bishop Lamor Whitehead, 44, was in the middle of his sermon at the Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries in Canarsie around 11:14 a.m. when the trio burst in, police said. “How many of you have lost your faith because you saw somebody else die?” Whitehead asked his congregation — right before spotting the armed intruders. “All right, all right,” Whitehead then said several times before hitting the floor on his hands and knees. The thieves made off with a treasure trove of items totaling $1,060,000: a $75,000 Rolex watch, a $75,000 Cavalier watch, a $25,000 Episcopal ruby and diamond ring, a $25,000 Episcopal diamond ring, a $25,000 pair of earrings, a $20,000 diamond and emerald cross, a $20,000 Episcopal ring, a $20,000 Episcopal cross and a $10,000 Episcopal gold cross. They then fled in a white Mercedes, Miller-Whitehead said. The church leader spotted them changing their clothes in the car as he tried to run after them, to no avail. Whitehead — who’s cozy with Mayor Eric Adams and previously did five years in prison for identity fraud and grand larceny — insisted on Instagram that his public displays of wealth didn’t lead to the costly robbery. “It’s not about me being flashy,” the Rolls-Royce-driving clergyman said in a video. “It’s about me purchasing what I want to purchase. It’s my prerogative to purchase what I want to purchase.” Whitehead last made news in May, when he tried to negotiate the surrender of an accused subway shooter, but authorities separately nabbed the suspect.
