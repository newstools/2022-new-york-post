Sophie Scott is soaking up every moment of summer with her longtime boyfriend, Patriots quarterback Mac Jones. Taking to Instagram on Thursday, Scott — who has been dating the second-year signal-caller since 2019 — posted a sunkissed snap as she lounged in a floral bikini while reading a book. Jones, who is gearing up for his second training camp in New England, reacted to Scott’s post a short while later, dropping the double heart emoji in the comments. It’s been an eventful summer for Jones, 23, and Scott so far, as the couple recently traveled to Bermuda for his sister’s wedding. Both Jones and Scott shared snapshots on social media from their time in “paradise,” which included a boat ride. “When in Bermuda,” Scott captioned a photo of herself modeling a two-piece with a drink in hand. The twosome later traded in their swimsuits for evening wear, as Scott stunned in a pale gown for the nuptials while Jones rocked a black tux. Jones is gearing up for his sophomore season in the league following an impressive rookie season. The former Alabama product, who was drafted 15th overall last year, threw for 3,801 yards with 22 touchdowns and 13 interceptions through 17 games. The Patriots also advanced to the postseason but were eliminated after being thrashed by the Bills, 47-17, in the wild-card round. Scott, who cheered on Jones all season long, commemorated his rookie year with a sweet tribute. “Rookie year  I’m so proud of you!” she gushed on Instagram in January.
