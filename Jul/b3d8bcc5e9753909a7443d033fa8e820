Make using the restroom a luxurious experience with the Aim to Wash! Smart Toilet Seat, upgrading your basic toilet seat and saving you money in the process.  In the US alone over three million tons of toilet paper are flushed down the drain every year, which means more than 54 million trees have to be cut down in the process. Help save the trees and enjoy a dual nozzle that helps you wash up with warm water. A tankless design conveniently provides an endless supply of hot water, and using the bidet feature can cut your toilet paper consumption by 80%! This low-maintenance toilet seat has a self-cleaning nozzle for before and after each use, and there’s a simple one-knob operation to use it. Choose between rear cleansing, feminine frontal wash, or activate the dryer. And a one-button control helps you adjust the temperature of the water and the seat, which stays toasty so you never have to sit on a cold one.
