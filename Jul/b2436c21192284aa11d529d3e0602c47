A man died after jumping into the Harlem River Saturday, officials said. The FDNY and NYPD’s water units were deployed after reports of a person in the river near the northern edge of the 25-acre waterfront Roberto Clemente State Park in The Bronx at around 12:25 p.m., police said. “He jumped into the Harlem River,” a department spokeswoman said Saturday afternoon. The man, who wasn’t immediately identified, was brought from the river and onto shore, cops said. A waiting ambulance rushed him to New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, an NYPD spokeswoman said.
