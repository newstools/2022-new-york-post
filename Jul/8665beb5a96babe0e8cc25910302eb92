Albany Democrats want to further restrict the sale of body armor weeks after passing similar legislation that fell short of banning the steel-plated gear used by a racist gunman as he allegedly massacred people at a Buffalo supermarket. The body armor ban is part of a sweeping gun control package passed by the state Senate on Friday as part of a special session called by Gov. Kathy Hochul following the US Supreme Court striking down century-old restrictions on carrying concealed weapons in the Empire State. “This will prevent criminals from being more reckless, even more emboldened, and hopefully lessen the damage that these kinds of people will provide because our feeling is that we can’t stop all the shootings,” Assemblyman Jonathan Jacobs (D-Newburgh), the bill’s sponsor, told The Post. “The least we can do is take away the criminals’ protection.” The state Assembly was expected to pass the legislation and send it to Hochul’s desk later Friday or early Saturday. Members of law enforcement and the military will receive exemptions from the ban, as will other professions to be designated by the state. Violators could face up to a year in jail, probation or fines, with additional felony penalties for repeat offenders. The new law is expected to cause serious collateral damage to the bottom line of businesses like 221B Tactical in Midtown. “I don’t see any issue with people buying body armor because they have an intention to commit a crime,” 221B co-owner Brad Pedell said Friday. “I think that’s the wrong way to look at it, but as a reseller, what am I going to do? I’m going to obey the law.”
