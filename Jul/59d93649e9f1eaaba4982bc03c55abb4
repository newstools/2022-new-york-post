Disneyland’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” ride said “Ello, poppet” to eager parkgoers on Friday. The ride — which has been at the California park since 1967 — reopened to fans after being closed for maintenance since March 4. Fans were happy to see Johnny Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow character remain on the ride since his relationship with the mouse house turned ugly amid his legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard. “Keep a spry eye out for sly Captain Jack Sparrow from the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ film series, as he schemes to get his hands on the spoils,” said the attraction’s description on the park’s website. However, the ride’s reopening day was plagued with some temporary closures. It opened an hour later than expected due to park officials seemingly trying to control crowd flow, Deadline reported. “Pirates” also closed and reopened twice before 2 p.m., the outlet reported, while fans on social media claimed there were four temporary closures in that timeframe. The Australian gossip site Poptopic recently said that Depp was in talks to return to the franchise and negotiating a $301 million deal with Disney, but his reps squashed that rumor in a statement to Fox News. During the trial, Depp had indicated he would never return to the franchise. “If Disney came to you with $300 million and a million alpacas, nothing on this Earth would get you to go back and work with Disney on a ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ film, correct?” asked Heard’s lawyer, Ben Rottenborn, during a cross-examination “That is true,” Depp replied.
