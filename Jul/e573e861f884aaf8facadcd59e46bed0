Rock singer Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins is set to host a charity gig on July 27 to benefit the victims of the Highland Park parade shooting. Corgan, who has lived in Highland Park for about 20 years, announced the fundraiser is titled “Together and Together Again.” The show will be held at Madame Zuzu’s, a plant-based tea house that Corgan owns with his partner fashion designer Chloe Mendel. It is located on the same strip where the senseless attack took place. In a bid to support his community, Corgan announced the benefit concert will raise funds for those who survived the horrific attack. Seven people were killed after a gunman allegedly opened fire at the Fourth of July parade using a “high-powered” rifle. More than 40 people, ranging in age from 8 to 85, were injured. “There are so many people here affected by this tragedy,” Corgan said in an Instagram video shared on Thursday. “It’s very close to our hearts and we hope you’ll participate and support as well.” The “Spaceboy” hitmaker said the show will feature several special guests. Corgan’s Smashing Pumpkins bandmates drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and jazz saxophonist Frank Catalano were announced as performers. The show will be streamed for free on the Smashing Pumpkins YouTube page, and a link will be provided for viewers to make donations. All proceeds will benefit the Highland Park Community Foundation.
