Count that one for the eye in the sky. Drama unfolded at Wimbledon on Wednesday when the top-seeded doubles team grew outraged with the Hawkeye replay system. The USA’s Rajeev Ram and Great Britain’s Joe Salisbury were tied 5-5 in the second set when they appeared to have secured a crucial service break. But their opponents — the French duo of Nicolas Mahut and Edouard Roger-Vasselin — challenged the call, ultimately leading to a reversal. “No way man, that is absolutely ridiculous,” Ram yelled at the chair umpire. “There’s no way. No way at all. We’re turning the machine off. We’re not in the future here.” Salisbury beckoned for the chair umpire’s supervisor, prompting a five-minute delay as the supervisor informed the duo that the matter would be investigated. Only then did Ram and Salisbury agree to resume play. “We saw it that way, the umpire saw it that way, the line judge called it out and the umpire didn’t overrule it and he agreed with us,” Salisbury said after the match. “We couldn’t believe that they had challenged it. We went and sat down convinced we’d won the game. “… Maybe we all need to get our eyes checked.” Salisbury also conceded that the duo was “pretty riled up about it and pretty frustrated,” believing it to be the second questionable call of the day that did not go in their favor. Despite the hoopla, Ram and Salisbury won the match in five sets, advancing to the semifinals.
