The Haskell Stakes, a marquee horse racing event at Monmouth Park, will take place on Saturday. Before it happens, though, Jeremy Pond & Andie Biancone of The Action Network are here to give their best bets (video above). Bob Baffert-trained Taiba (7/5) arrives in New Jersey as the consensus favorite while Jack Christopher (3/2) and White Abarrio (5/1) follow closely in the eight-horse field. For Pond, he’s a believe that second-favorite Jack Christopher is the best bet for Saturday’s race. “[Jack Christopher] is probably one of the best three-year-olds in the country,” Pond says. “I see him having a monster campaign if he stays healthy.” Given Jack Christopher has recovered from a few nagging injuries early in 2022, Pond recommends bettors use the horse in exotics as well. From there, Pond will be using the third-favorite — White Abarrio — in his second slot for the exotic bets available to bettors. As for Biancone, she’s in agreement that Jack Christopher and White Abarrio are best bets for the first two spots on the board. The key difference between her and Pond’s handicap, though, is the evaluation of Taiba.  “I think Taiba could take a piece of it,” Biancone says. “He maybe has more quality than some of the horses…but I just don’t think he’s the winner.
