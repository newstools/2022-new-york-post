Ryan Strome is going coast to coast in NHL free agency. After the Rangers replaced Strome with former Carolina Hurricanes center Vincent Trocheck, Strome landed with the Anaheim Ducks on a five-year contract worth a reported $25 million. Strome, 29, played parts of four seasons with the Rangers after being traded by the Edmonton Oilers for Ryan Spooner. He had 54 points, including a career-high 21 goals, last season while centering the Artemi Panarin line. He then had nine points in 19 playoff games while dealing with a pelvic injury. The Rangers signed Trocheck on Wednesday to a seven-year, $39.375 million contract.
