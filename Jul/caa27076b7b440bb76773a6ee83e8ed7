The Chicago White Sox have been one of the more underwhelming teams this season. Heading into Wednesday, Chicago was 42-45 and five games out of first place in the AL Central. The White Sox, however, also have a path to the playoffs through the wild card, and they trailed by 3 ¹/₂ games for the final spot. While the White Sox have certainly been disappointing, I think the oddsmakers have gone too far by making them a +135 underdog in their series opener Thursday against the division-leading Minnesota Twins. Johnny Cueto is listed as probable for the White Sox, while the Twins will counter with Sonny Gray. It took until April 5 for Cueto to land with the White Sox after Lance Lynn went down with an injury. He is proving, however, that he can still pitch in the big leagues as he’s 3-4 with a 2.91 ERA and 1.15 WHIP. Cueto still can pitch deep into games at this stage in his career. He has logged at least six innings in nine of his 11 outings this season. Moreover, he has yet to allow more than three earned runs in eight straight starts.   Despite their struggles, the White Sox club are still a dangerous team. My model makes this game much closer to a pick ’em, so I like the value with the road ’dogs in this spot. The play: White Sox +135 – BetMGM.
