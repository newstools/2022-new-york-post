A fan went a little too far at Machine Gun Kelly’s concert last week. The 32-year-old singer was performing at the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon, Thursday when one of his fans got aggressively handsy with him. Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker, went up into the seats with audience members and got close to them. In a video obtained by TMZ, one man is seen wrapping his hand around the “Emo Girl” singer, appearing to try to get a selfie. The fan continued to wrap his arm around the rest of Machine Gun Kelly’s waist and eventually reached to his groin area — with the star trying to break free from the grip. The man held onto Kelly’s crotch until his hand was removed by the singer. Moments after, someone else pushed him away and security appears to get involved. Machine Gun Kelly is currently on his Mainstream Sellout Tour, wrapping up the tour’s first leg on Aug. 13 in Cleveland, Ohio, before heading to Germany for the second leg of the tour.
