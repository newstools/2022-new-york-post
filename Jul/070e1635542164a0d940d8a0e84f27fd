Former President Donald Trump is considering jumping into the 2024 presidential race early, maybe even before the midterm elections, a source said. “There’s discussions about an early launch, and people are planning,” a person close to the ex-commander-in-chief told The Post Saturday. “There are no specifics, but people are preparing,” the source added. “They are laying the groundwork.” Trump could “possibly” announce he is running before November, the insider said. Earlier Saturday, the New York Times and CNN reported that Trump — who began his first presidential campaign in June 2015 — is considering starting the potential 2024 bid at an earlier stage in the 2024 election cycle. The Republican Florida resident caught advisers off guard by hinting he may reveal his candidacy via social media without giving notice to those who would be part of the run, The Times reported. His staffers are now hurrying to create a campaign apparatus before the possible announcement, which could come as early as this month, according to the newspaper. The 45th president has told allies he wants to start his presidential bid as soon as this month, CNN reported. Trump, who was elected in 2016 and defeated by President Joe Biden in 2020, told the New Yorker last month that he was “very close to making a decision” about what would be his third consecutive presidential campaign. He also said he would win in a GOP primary contest that includes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 contender. In May, ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani — a Trump confidante and his former personal lawyer — told The Post Trump will vie for the presidency again in 2024. “My instinct is he’s running,” Giuliani said. “I have known him for a long time. I see what he’s doing and how he’s preparing, and he sounds to me like a man who is excited about the possibility of running.”
