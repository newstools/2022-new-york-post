New video allegedly shows a Dallas, Texas, Taco Bell employee hurling boiling water at a woman and girl who have since filed a lawsuit claiming they were attacked after asking for their incorrect order to be remade. The footage, released by attorneys for Brittany Davis and her 16-year-old niece, identified in court papers as C.T., captures a fast food worker filling up a clear pitcher with what appears to be steaming water while talking on the phone. In a different camera angle, the employee can be seen throwing the liquid at the woman and girl standing on the other side of the counter, the Dallas Morning News reported. The two are seen running away after the liquid is flung at them. The video stems from an alleged June 17 incident. Davis and her niece say they were at the Taco Bell drive-thru but decided to go inside the fast food joint to correct their order after employees got it wrong three times, according to the lawsuit. The two claim a staffer then threw boiling water on them, leaving them severely injured, according to the suit, filed July 13. They are asking for more than $1 million in damages from defendants Yum! Brands (Taco Bell’s parent company), local franchisee North Texas Bells and two unnamed employees. The pair’s attorneys, Ben Crump and Paul Grinke, on Friday released the 2 1/2-minute video, which shows 12 camera angles inside the store. One part of the footage shows an employee hiding what the attorneys alleged was a gun under his shirt while the liquid is thrown by the other staffer. Taco Bell said in a statement to the Texas newspaper that it takes the “safety and the wellbeing of team members and customers seriously.” The company added that it is in contact with the franchise owner and operator of that particular store but that it could not comment on the lawsuit. No arrests have been made in connection to the incident and the case is being referred to a grand jury, the Dallas Police Department told the Morning News.
