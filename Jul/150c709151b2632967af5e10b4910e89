Is it really the 4th of July without music? The fireworks might be the grand finale for most celebrations, but some great tunes make the buildup fun and memorable. Sure, you could blast some music from your tiny phone speaker, or you could listen in style with a blend of retro and modern aesthetics. The Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable with Bluetooth Speaker is a belt-driven turntable in the style of the classics, but it’s got some modern amenities. During our 4th of July Sale, get the Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable on sale for $223.99 (Reg. $369) with coupon JULY20, which can save you 20% on all purchases of $100 or more through July 5th. This turntable has the look of a classic and the crystal-clear sound of a high-end modern speaker. It’s also got noise reduction, improved tracking, and a sub-chassis mechanism that can limit low-frequency acoustic feedback. That’s the stuff that gives your vinyl that staticy sound. “Looks and sounds great I love the older style look of it,” says an Amazon reviewer. If you’re having a 4th of July party, grab some of your old favorites — or even some classic 4th of July hits — and hit the turntable. All four bluetooth speakers come together for a rich, clear sound that might have you hearing new notes to songs you’ve heard a thousand times. You can even use tone and pitch control to change them up yourself. And if your party isn’t feeling your music, grab a drink and plug some headphones into the 3.5mm Aux and have yourself some time alone, maybe with a big plate of BBQ. It’s Independence day, after all. Kick it retro with a modern flair. During our 4th of July sale, the Mbeat Hi-Fi Turntable with Bluetooth Speaker is on sale for $223.99 (Reg. $369) with code JULY20. You better hurry though. Sale ends July 5th. Prices subject to change.
