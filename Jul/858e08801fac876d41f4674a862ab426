The Royals will play the Blue Jays in a four-game series that begins in Toronto on Thursday. They’ll do so without almost half of their big league roster. Players who aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19 aren’t allowed to enter Canada, per MLB’s collective bargaining agreement, and Kansas City’s 26-man roster includes 10 such players, per ESPN’s Jeff Passan. The 10 who won’t be able to cross the border, according to Passan, are All-Star outfielder Andrew Benintendi; second baseman/outfielder Whit Merrifield; catcher M.J. Melendez; DH Hunter Dozier; starting pitchers Brad Keller and Brady Singer; center fielder Michael A. Taylor; outfielder Kyle Isbel; reliever Dylan Coleman; and catcher Cam Gallagher. That list includes Kansas City’s four top hitters — Benintendi, Dozier, Witt and Merrifield — and their two best starting pitchers. Previously, just 25 players in all of baseball had not been allowed to play in Toronto because of their vaccination status, Passan tweeted. The Phillies are currently wrapping up a series at Toronto on Wednesday night. They’ve been without four of their players, including catcher J.T. Realmuto, because of vaccination status. Benintendi and Taylor, meanwhile, could see their trade value drop in the American League due to their inability to play in Toronto. The Royals will call up a several Double-A and Triple-A players to fill the void. The players missing the trip will not be paid or receive service time.
