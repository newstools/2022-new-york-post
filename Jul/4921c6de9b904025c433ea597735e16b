The Mets’ biggest need is a hitter, as Dom Smith hasn’t found his 2020 magic (though he’s better lately) and J.D. Davis isn’t as good as his peripheral numbers suggest. So the great Nelson Cruz is on their radar. Cruz’s Nationals teammate Josh Bell would cost a big prospect, so Cruz makes sense for them. As does Trey Mancini, as mentioned here last week. The Mets could start in-house and consider Francisco Alvarez or Mark Vientos for the DH opening. They are reluctant to give up their top prospects (Alvarez, Brett Baty, Ronny Mauricio, Matt Allen or Vientos) and determined they will not do that for a free agent-to-be, even Willson Contreras, who sits alone as a superb hitting catcher destined to be dealt. The Mets are hoping for two starts from Jacob deGrom before the deadline, which would let them know if they need to look at the starter market, too. Mets people are convinced deGrom will opt out almost no matter what. Though the Braves have been rumored, it is hard to see them gambling if they have doubts at all — they took five star players to arbitration and drew a line on iconic Freddie Freeman. The Rangers may make more sense. One team that may match for the Mets is the Tigers, who have not one but two lefty relievers: Gregory Soto and Andrew Chafin. The Mets didn’t sign righty starter Kumar Rocker out of Vanderbilt because their doctors questioned his shoulder durability. However, he recently had a shoulder scope and is looking very good pitching for Tri Cities in Troy, N.Y. He should be a first-rounder again.
