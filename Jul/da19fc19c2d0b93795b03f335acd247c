Another Rikers Island detainee died of a suspected drug overdose Friday, marking the 11th in-custody death for the Department of Correction this year, The Post has learned. Around 9:30 a.m., the FDNY responded to Rikers Island after receiving reports of two unconscious detainees at the Anne M. Kross Center, according to an FDNY spokesperson and multiple jailhouse sources. One of the detainees was pronounced dead on scene and another was transported to Bellevue Hospital, the FDNY said. The detainees are believed to have overdosed on fentanyl, sources said. The name of the person who died has not yet been released and further details about the incident weren’t immediately available. Late Sunday, a rookie correction officer was fired after Elijah Muhammad, 31, was found unresponsive in his cell at the George R. Vierno Center at about 9:45 p.m. Sunday from a suspected fentanyl overdose. At least two other men in the same housing area as Muhammad suffered medical emergencies late Sunday into Monday and investigators were seeking to determine if fentanyl was also involved, jailhouse sources said previously. The DOC didn’t return multiple requests for comment seeking more information on the detainee’s conditions. Last year, the DOC saw 16 in-custody deaths, the most since 2016 and more than 2019 and 2020 combined. This year’s death toll is far outpacing the steep count recorded in 2021. As of this time last year, the department had seen just seven deaths, but 11 have already been recorded this year, a nearly 60 percent increase.
