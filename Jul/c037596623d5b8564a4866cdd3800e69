Save an additional 20% if you purchase by July 5. Between work, life, and maybe raising a family, there’s just not time to hit the gym every day. That doesn’t mean you can’t still do things at home to keep your body looking and feeling how you want. You may not have an hour to hit the track, but what if there was a tool you could use at home that could tone your body and help get rid of stubborn fat. The Lumina NRG® Fat Iron At-Home Body Slimming Device only asks for 15 minutes a day, and you could start seeing fat burn away, smoother skin, and more invigorating results. During our 4th of July Sale, the Fat Iron is on sale for $263.99 (Reg. $599) with code JULY20 for purchases of $100 or more, now through July 5th! Keeping your body toned and tight can feel like an impossible task with everything else going on in your life. Luckily, the Fat Iron only takes a few minutes a day, and it could have you seeing results quickly. This FDA-approved iron was developed based on technology already in use by leading plastic surgeons. It combines three common fat-reducing technologies: bi-polar radio frequency, electro muscle stimulation, and photon red light therapy. It sounds like science fiction, but it’s very much real. It may not sculpt you a full set of abs in one sitting, but just 15 minutes per day has been clinically proven to demonstrate real, tangible results. Your skin could tighten, fat could melt away, and even stretch marks may fade. If that’s not enough, the Fat Iron is cordless, because trimming fat doesn’t have to have strings attached. Burn away fat with this relaxing and at-home device. During our 4th of July Sale, you can get the Lumina NRG Fat Iron At-Home Body Slimming Device on sale for $263.99 (Reg. $599) with code JULY20.
