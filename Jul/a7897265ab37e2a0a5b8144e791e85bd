Odell Beckham Jr. is enjoying the offseason with his biggest supporter, girlfriend Lauren Wood. The couple, who welcomed son Zydn in February, appeared to share an intimate moment in steamy new snaps that Wood posted on Instagram earlier this week. Captioning the post, “A Pisces & a Scorpio,” Wood is seen wearing a bikini as she embraces the 29-year-old wide receiver in the water against a sunkissed backdrop. Beckham is continuing to work his way back from the torn ACL he suffered in February during the Rams’ Super Bowl win over the Bengals. Before exiting the game, the former first-round pick scored a touchdown. As of Thursday, Beckham remains a free agent. The Rams previously expressed interest in welcoming him back into the fold, but as general manager Les Snead said in March, “It’s a little more complex with the injury situation.” Beckham is still close with the Rams, even crashing the wedding of head coach Sean McVay and his now-wife, Veronika Khomyn, in June. “Only in Odell’s fashion could he be the wedding crasher at our wedding,” McVay said during an appearance on the “I AM ATHLETE” podcast, noting he invited the captains from last year’s team, as well as other retired players with whom he’s still friendly. “So he showed up, crashed the wedding and I loved that he was there. Even my mom, she said, ‘Oh, he’s so nice and he is handsome in person too,'” McVay continued. McVay, who is readying for his sixth season with the Rams, later joked to Beckham, “I said, ‘You crash the wedding, you re-sign with the Rams then, man.'” Before joining the Rams last November, Beckham had a messy split from the Browns after two-and-a-half seasons in Cleveland. He began his NFL career with the Giants in 2014 but was traded to the Browns five years later. Beckham has been linked to Wood, a fitness trainer, since 2019.
