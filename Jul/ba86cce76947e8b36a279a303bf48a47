An apparently drunk man stabbed a straphanger on a Bronx subway train on Saturday night — in the latest violent incident on New York City’s transit system, police said. A 34-year-old man was stabbed in the torso with a knife by a man on a southbound 6 train after a dispute near the Parkchester station around 8:24 p.m., cops said. The victim was transported to Jacobi Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to police. The suspect, described as a man in his 20s, fled at the Parkchester station. No arrests have been made. Mohammed Miyah, an MTA worker manning the Parkchester Subway Station, told The Post he saw six or seven officers respond to the scene to look for the assailant after the frightening incident, but were unable to find him. He said doesn’t “feel safe at all” on public transit since being robbed himself while taking the train a few months ago. “Violence is happening often around here, in this area and at the station also,” he said. “The stabbing happened today and there was a shooting a couple of months ago a block away from here on Virginia Avenue. “There’s always robberies, with people stealing wallets and mobile phones in this area,” he continued. “I don’t feel safe.” Miyah said he was robbed at the Elmhurst train station while riding the Queens R train around in the middle of the afternoon a few months ago while he was off duty. He said they took his wallet “and everything.” “Day or night I don’t feel safe at all,” he said.
