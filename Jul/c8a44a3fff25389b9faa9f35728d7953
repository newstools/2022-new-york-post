A Colorado man once accused of murdering his wife pleaded guilty to casting a presidential ballot for Donald Trump in her name — because he thought the Republican could use the vote, according to reports. Barry Morphew, 53, claimed he didn’t know it was illegal to fill out a ballot on behalf of a spouse and told authorities he did so in his wife Suzanne Morphew’s name “just because I wanted Trump to win. “I just thought give him another vote. I figured all these other guys are cheating,” according to The Denver Post. Suzanne Morphew, 49, went for a bike ride on Mother’s Day 2020 and never returned. Her husband refused to take a polygraph in the days after Suzanne’s disappearance and was arrested in May 2021 on charges of murder after deliberation, tampering with physical evidence and attempting to influence a public servant. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors dropped the charges in April just weeks before a trial was set to begin, saying they needed more time to locate Suzanne’s remains.
