Looking to invest in some “reel” estate? Sofia Vergara and her husband, Joe Manganiello, have listed their Beverly Hills estate for $19.6 million, the brokerage repping the listing told The Post. Built in 2006, Vergara, 50, purchased the seven-bedroom, 11-bathroom property in 2014 for $10.6 million, while she was still engaged to Nick Loeb, and a year before marrying the “True Blood” star Manganiello. (Vergara, of course, is known for her hilarious role on “Modern Family.”) Spanning over 11,300 square feet and situated on a more than half-acre lot, the home features amenities including a gym, a theater and a wine room. The gated home also boasts a new chef’s kitchen — and a landscaped backyard with a pool and a spa, and even a barbecue area. Barry Peele, of Sotheby’s International Realty Beverly Hills Brokerage, holds the listing. This move to sell comes two years after the couple upgraded and shelled out $26 million for the former home of baseball great Barry Bonds, located in the Beverly Park neighborhood. Spanning over 17,100 square feet on a 1.85-acre plot of land, that new Italianate villa-style  home comes with a two-story guesthouse, a sports court, a pool and spa, and a tree-lined driveway. Their new neighborhood is in an exclusive enclave that counts Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg (who is currently listing his home for sale) among its residents. Vergara star married Manganiello, 45, in 2015. The two got engaged after six months of dating. She is expected to play late notorious drug trafficker Griselda Blanco in a limited Netflix series.
