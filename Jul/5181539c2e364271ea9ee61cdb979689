Flame Out. The Blue Jays, hot earlier this season, have cooled and have been passed by the Red Sox in the wild-card chase. Toronto is in Oakland and there is no better place to reignite. We had the Jays and Jose Berrios (6-4, 5.72) when he beat (two runs over five) the Rays on July 1. The A’s James Kaprielian (1-5, 5.43) picked up his first win in 12 starts this season by allowing one run over six in Seattle. Toronto has been good to us this year but Berrios has given up 14 runs over his last 6 ²/₃ innings on the road. Berry, berry bad. Not today, Jose! 10 units on the Blue Jays -190 on BetMGM! Our Fifth of July was as good as the Fourth. Devoured the leftover burgers and dogs while watching the Mariners barbecue the Padres 6-2. Sam Haggerty homered and Logan Gilbert picked up his 10th win on the year. Back-to-back W’s have us +1,614 joeycoras.
