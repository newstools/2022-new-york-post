The Boss is back. For the first time since COVID pulled the plug on many a tour, Bruce Springsteen will be hitting the road with his E Street Band in a 2023 US tour that was announced on Tuesday morning. The trek — their first in North America since 2016 — will kick off Feb. 1 in Tampa, Florida for the first of 31 performances before it heads to Europe in April. The tour hits the New York area for a stop at Madison Square Garden on April 1, followed by shows at Barclays Center on April 3, the UBS Arena on April 9 and 11, and Prudential Center on April 14. After Springsteen and his longtime crew — Roy Bittan (piano, synthesizer), Nils Lofgren (guitar, vocals), Garry Tallent  (bass), Stevie Van Zandt,  (guitar, vocals), Max Weinberg (drums), Soozie Tyrell (violin, guitar, vocals), Jake Clemons (saxophone), Charlie Giordano (keyboards) and, of course, the Boss’ wife Patti Scialfa (guitar, vocals) — return from Europe in July, they will begin a second North American leg of their tour in August. Dates for that leg have yet to be announced. This also marks Springsteen’s return to the road after releasing his last album, “Letter to You,” during the heart of the pandemic in October 2020. The “Dancing in the Dark” singer reopened Broadway after its COVID closure in June last year. “Springsteen on Broadway” ran for more than a year back in 2017 and 2018. But it’s been six long years since Springsteen, now 72, last launched a trek with the E Streeters on The River Tour. So surely fans will want to appreciate this New Jersey legend once again now that he’s back bringing the thunder to the road.
