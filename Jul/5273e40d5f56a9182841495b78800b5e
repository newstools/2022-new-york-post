Aron Baynes is taking a big step toward returning to the NBA. Baynes, who suffered a freak spinal cord injury in Tokyo during the Olympics last year, is holding workouts for NBA teams on Friday in Las Vegas, according to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst. “It’s a remarkable comeback and a testament to all the hard work he’s put in,” Baynes’ agent told ESPN. Playing for Team Australia, Baynes injured his neck in a game against Italy. He later fell in the team’s bathroom, and exacerbated the injury — knocking himself unconscious and subsequently losing the ability to walk. “It was a complicated series of events,” Australian chief medical officer Dr. David Hughes told reporters at the time. “He did suffer an injury during the match on the court, and then he had a slip in the bathroom and suffered further injury. “It became apparent to the medical staff that this was a bit more serious than just an average injury and so as a precaution he was taken to hospital and he’s undergoing further tests at the moment.” Per ESPN, Baynes was hospitalized for two months, and just resumed basketball activity this past January. The 35-year-old Baynes has played for the Spurs, Pistons, Celtics, Suns and Raptors. For his career, he has averaged 6.0 points and 4.8 rebounds per game.
