What does Harry Styles smell like? It’s a question that apparently ranks high for fans. Well, don’t bother trying to sniff out the answer now — because Lizzo just told us. “Harry smells very good,” the “Truth Hurts” singer revealed to Elle during their “Ask Me Anything” segment, wherein she answered questions from her fans. “He smells like soap,” the 34-year-old performer — and friend of Styles, 28 — claimed. “Whatever soap he uses, it smells like that. Like it’s not a cologne or a deodorant thing, it’s very like whatever soap he showers in.” “Every time I see him, I be like: ‘You smell like soap!’,” she added. No confirmation yet on the brand of soap Styles uses. His scent wasn’t the only thing about Styles the singer discussed. In an either/or question pitting Cardi B against the “Golden” crooner, Lizzo said that Styles would be the one to call to bail her out of trouble. “I’m going to say Mister Harry Styles, only because that’s actually happened,” she claimed. “And Harry stays really calm under pressure, and he turns up real chill like. You know what I’m saying?” she continued. “So I think he would be able to keep me together while everything is falling apart.” The pop star, whose catchy single “About Damn Time” shows up in nearly 2 million videos on TikTok currently, also spilled who she would love to see dance to her music on the video sharing app — it’s Beyoncé (“I would be a happy woman”) — and who she would recruit to re-create the iconic video for the remake of 2001’s Lady Marmalade featuring Christina Aguilera, P!nk, Mýa and Lil’ Kim. “Me, as Missy,” she said, thoughtfully. “SZA as Mýa. Doja as Lil’ Kim and Ariana Grande as Christina Aguilera’s part.” And we have to agree — “It would be fierce,” she added.
