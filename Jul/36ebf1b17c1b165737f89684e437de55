Tom Brady and wife Gisele Bündchen weren’t spared from Steph Curry’s roast  Wednesday during his opening monologue at the 2022 ESPY Awards. The reigning NBA Finals MVP, 34, cracked jokes about Brady un-retiring this offseason, and said he finally figured out why the Buccaneers quarterback decided to go back to work after a 40-day retirement. “Tom Brady, he’s the only guy I know on earth who would rather get hit by [Rams defensive tackle] Aaron Donald than hang out with a supermodel,” said Curry, who served as the show’s host. “We all make choices and sometimes you don’t understand some of them.” Prior to that, Curry said, “After celebrating three kids’ birthdays in two weeks, I finally understand why Tom Brady keeps coming back to work. Relaxation sometimes is exhausting.” Curry and his wife, Ayesha, 33, share three children together: 4-year-old son Canon, and daughters Riley, 10, and Ryan, 7, who looked adorable while attending the ESPYs. Brady, 44, announced in March that he’s returning for his 23rd NFL season and his third with the Buccaneers. Ahead of training camp, the quarterback spent time with his family, including Bündchen, who celebrated her 42nd birthday on Wednesday, and their kids, son Benjamin, 12, and daughter Vivian, 9. Curry’s friendship with Brady dates back years, with the two golfing together when they’re not in their respective seasons. During Wednesday’s big night, Curry also accepted the ESPY Award for Best NBA Player, beating out the Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic, Sixers center Joel Embiid and Mavericks star Luka Doncic.
