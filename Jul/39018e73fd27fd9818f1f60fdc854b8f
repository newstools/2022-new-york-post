A Hamptons home once owned by “Real Housewives of New York” veteran Jill Zarin and her late husband Bobby, is on the market for $6.99 million. The gated, 6,500-square-foot home, known as Casa Maria, is at 2296 Deerfield Road in Sag Harbor, New York. Set on 2 acres, it’s also where Jill Zarin launched her annual summer luxury luncheons. Zarin now owns a waterfront condo in Sag Harbor, as we exclusively reported last summer, and held this year’s luxury luncheon earlier this month at the Halsey House & Garden. The home comes with six bedrooms, 5½ bathrooms and a home gym. There’s also a formal dining room with a wet bar, a living room, game room and chef’s kitchen with details like a water filtration system. Outside, there’s a large three-level deck, a saltwater pool, clay tennis court and a three-car garage. The listing broker is Nancy Pearson of Douglas Elliman.
