Accused subway mass shooter Frank James whined about media coverage of his case Monday, telling a judge he hasn’t been “too good” since getting locked up on federal terrorism charges. James — who allegedly shot 10 people on a subway car in April — was asked how he was doing by Judge William Kuntz during a brief appearance in Brooklyn federal court Monday afternoon. “Not too good, your honor,” replied the 62-year-old, wearing a tan jail uniform and sporting a short gray beard. Kuntz then asked the accused gunman if he’s watched or listened to any baseball while in custody at Brooklyn’s notorious Metropolitan Detention Center. “I’ve watched a bit of baseball, yeah,” James said, before adding: “I’ve read some things in the press I’m not too happy about.” The judge then turned to prosecutors and James’ defense attorneys, who agreed to set a tentative trial date of Feb. 27, 2023. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York have recovered a trove of evidence in the case, including surveillance video, DNA from the gun and witness statements. James — who was arrested following a 30-hour citywide manhunt — faces life in prison if convicted of committing a terrorist attack on a mass transit system. The maniac allegedly sprayed more than 30 bullets on a packed Manhattan-bound N train as it motored through a tunnel below the street of Sunset Park on April 12. The attack injured 29 people, including 10 who were shot, authorities said. James was indicted on the terrorism count and a charge of firing a gun in a violent crime. He’s pleaded not guilty.
