“Minions: The Rise of Gru” has exploded in cinemas worldwide — and it may, unfortunately, be causing people to explode, too. IHOP revealed a special “Minion Menu” to promote the release of the popular sequel film, but some TikTokers are claiming the food made them very unwell. TikTok user Caroline shared a video of her and a friend grabbing a meal at an IHOP earlier in the week, writing, “We just wanted to enjoy our minion meal.” The limited-edition menu offers a mix of delightfully named items including Ba-Ba-Banana Pudding Pancakes, Cinna-Minions donut holes, Gru’s Evil Steakburger, Cold Gru Iced Coffee and more. But instead of enjoying the novelty menu, the pair claimed to have ended up with food poisoning after ingesting what appears to be undercooked food including chicken nuggets, which aren’t listed on the special Minion menu. “My body is shutting down,” Caroline wrote in a comment under the viral clip, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times since it was posted late last week. Followers expressed their sympathy for the duo, although some claimed they had also gotten sick from the food. “I had the minion menu and I had diarrhea for 4 days,” one user alleged. “I had the minions meal cold brew and gru’d my pants,” claimed another. “Bro thats not even rare, that’s still running around in a field,” one user joked. It’s not known which IHOP Caroline and her friend visited. The Post has reached out to IHOP and Illumination Entertainment for comment.
