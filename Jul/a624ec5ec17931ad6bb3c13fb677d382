Paige Spiranac doesn’t have time for haters — especially on holidays. The golfer-turned-influencer kicked off July 4th on Monday by posting a festive video of herself rocking a stars-and-stripes-themed two-piece as she demonstrated the different ways to eat hot dogs. “So last year, I did how many hot dogs I could eat in 10 minutes, and the thought of that makes me want to gag,” said Spiranac, who filmed herself eating five and a half hot dogs in 10 minutes last July in an attempt to give Joey Chestnut “a run for his money.” “Instead, I’m going to show you the techniques I picked up from the best hot dog eaters in the world.” Although Spiranac didn’t channel formally channel her inner-Chestnut, the defending champ did claim a record-setting 15th victory on Monday in Nathan’s annual hot dog-eating competition. He consumed 63 hot dogs in total, all the while on crutches and defending himself from a protester who crashed the event. Spiranac, 29, herself acknowledge the wild moment on Twitter, re-posting a clip that featured the protestor — and Chestnut — in action. “Me to anyone who tells me to stop making hot dog videos,” Spiranac tweeted Tuesday. This isn’t the first time Spiranac has taken her critics to task over her cheeky food videos. Earlier this summer, she told a troll to “lighten up” after she posted a video of herself making a milkshake. “How can anybody take her seriously?” the Twitter user said, to which Spiranac replied, “Lighten up. It’s a stupid video. Not supposed to be taken serious.”
