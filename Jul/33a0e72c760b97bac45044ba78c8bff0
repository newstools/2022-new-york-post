A lingerie-clad Paige VanZant celebrated her love with husband Austin Vanderford in a PDA-filled photo shoot. In new Instagram snaps shared over the Fourth of July, the former UFC star, 28, is seen sharing a passionate kiss with her MMA fighter hubby, 32, whom she’s been married to since 2018. “You don’t find love, you build it. We need to celebrate more couples,” the caption of the post read. VanZant, who made her pro wrestling debut with All Elite Wrestling at the end of May,  showed off her fit physique in the shots, modeling a black thong and mesh lingerie with thigh garters. The couple brought the heat to Instagram earlier in the day in a separate post, which featured VanZant modeling cheeky bikini bottoms as she got close to Vanderford, who sported red and white board shorts. “He is one lucky man for sure Paige,” one user commented on the post while another responded, “I see why you guys are married. Fire chemistry.” One user even declared that the couple is “breaking the internet” with their steamy snapshots. The bare-knuckle beauty advertised some of the sexy photos as part of a special July 4th deal on her exclusive fan website, where people can pay for sultry photos and videos of the fighter. VanZant launched her exclusive content site, PaigeFanZant.com, back in March 2021.
