Ivana Trump was laid to rest at the bucolic Trump National Golf Club cemetery in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Wednesday, a source told The Post. The ex-wife of former president Donald Trump was buried in a rose gold-hued casket at the tony golf club — which includes a pool complex next to 17th century farm buildings — following her funeral in Manhattan earlier in the afternoon. “It was beautiful,” the source said of Ivana’s burial service, which was attended by family and a few close friends and included words from Donald and their three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. The 45th president told the group “just what an incredible woman she was and what a strong woman and she commanded a room,” according to the source, who was in attendance. The glamorous business woman was buried “not too far from the main club house. They have a private grassy area. It’s just a very discreet piece of granite engraved with her name,” the source said. The former couple’s kids had earlier also addressed the roughly 100 mourners during the funeral at St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church on the Upper East Side, lauding their “trailblazer” mom as an inspiration. The New York City society woman was remembered as “a force of nature” and “the embodiment of the American dream” at the  invitation-only memorial. In 2017, Donald Trump proposed plans to build a small, 10-plot graveyard overlooking the first hole of the golf course for his family, The Washington Post reported at the time. The former commander-in-chief has said in the past he plans to be buried at the leafy site, too. “Mr. Trump . . . specifically chose this property for his final resting place as it is his favorite property,” his company wrote in a 2014 state filing. Ivana Trump, 73, died last week after a fall down the stairs at her Manhattan home. She and Donald divorced in the 1990s.
