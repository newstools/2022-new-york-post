Texas A&M wide receiver Ainias Smith was arrested on Wednesday for charges of driving while intoxicated, unlawful carrying of a weapon, and marijuana possession. He was scheduled to make an appearance at SEC media day on Thursday. The 21-year-old senior was booked in the Brazos County Jail by university police. He posted his $8,000 bail, according to jail records. According to a police report acquired by the Houston Chronicle, Smith’s arrest took place just after 2 a.m. when he was caught speeding. Police searched the car and found a “rolled joint of marijuana” and a gun with a “full magazine and a round chambered.” Smith and a passenger both denied ownership of the items. The 5-foot-10, 190-pound receiver is now the second Texas A&M receiver to be arrested this year. In March, Demond Demas was arrested for assault and family violence before being cut from the team. Smith was a team captain for the Aggies last season. He led his team with six touchdown receptions on 47 catches and ended the year with 509 receiving yards. He has played in 21 games over the past three seasons, compiling an impressive 15 touchdowns and 1,321 yards through the air and also four touchdowns and 373 yards on the ground.
