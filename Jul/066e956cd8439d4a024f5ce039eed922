A man died after jumping into a man-made lake Wednesday morning at SoFi Stadium — the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers, authorities said. The 45-year-old man was reportedly trespassing on the property of the Inglewood, California stadium at about 6 a.m. when he ventured to the 15-foot-deep lake, swam to the center and never resurfaced, Inglewood Mayor James Butts said at a press conference. The man, who hasn’t been identified, first hopped a fence to access the parking lot of the stadium. Stadium security guards spotted the man on surveillance footage and called police, but the rescue effort quickly turned into a body retrieval mission. Divers from the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department Special Enforcement Bureau recovered the man’s body from the lake more than three hours later. Officials don’t know why the man was at the stadium or why he went into the water, Butts said. The mayor added that he didn’t believe there was anything SoFi Stadium could have done to prevent the tragedy. “This is someone who made a conscious decision to trespass onto the property, get into the lake and he ended up having some distress and difficulty so I don’t think that SoFi could have done to prevent this,” Butts said.
