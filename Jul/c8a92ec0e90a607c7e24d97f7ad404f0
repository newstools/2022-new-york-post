In a positive sign for Tiger Woods ahead of the British Open, the 46-year-old played an 18-hole practice round on Sunday at St. Andrews, the first time he’s done so before a major this year. According to ESPN, the round included three birdies after he walked all 18 holes with Justin Thomas on Saturday night. “He was struggling early, but came on as the day went on,” Woods’ caddie, Joe LaCava, told ESPN. “That’s encouraging.” Woods himself didn’t speak to reporters in Scotland, but will on Monday and Tuesday. He’s won twice at St. Andrews and has a third Open Championship, won at Royal Liverpool in 2006. Woods, who is dealing with a surgically repaired right leg following a car crash in February 2021, played nine-hole practice rounds ahead of The Masters in April and the PGA Championship in May. He made the cut at both tournaments, but faded over the weekend, hitting a 78 on Saturday and Sunday at Augusta, his worst ever scores at the course. He withdrew from the PGA Championship after scoring a 79 in the third round due to pain in his leg, then skipped the US Open in June. Last week, he played two rounds at the JP McManus Pro-Am in Limerick, Ireland, scoring at 7-over through 36 holes, then played a practice round with Rory McIlroy in Ireland on Thursday. Thomas, at least, believes Woods can contend at St. Andrews. “I’ve learned better than to challenge anything about him,” Thomas said, per ESPN. This week will be the first time that Thomas plays The Open at the Old Course. He spent the practice round trying to pick up tips from Woods, a veteran of the legendary venue. “I understand he’s going to be a little withholding of some information, but I’m trying to needle him and get as much off of him as I can,” Thomas said, “because he’s done pretty well around this place.”
