James Cameron revealed he might not direct the fourth and fifth films of the “Avatar” franchise. Speaking to Empire, Cameron said the fact that sci-fi films take so much time to make might mean he won’t be captaining the ship on the final two movies. “The Avatar films themselves are kind of all-consuming,” he told the outlet. “I’ve got some other things I’m developing as well that are exciting.” “I think eventually over time – I don’t know if that’s after three or after four – I’ll want to pass the baton to a director that I trust to take over, so I can go do some other stuff that I’m also interested in. Or maybe not. I don’t know,” the “Titanic” director added. After the original film’s release in 2009, the storyline got four sequels added on to its name. The first of the upcoming three films, titled “Avatar: The Way of Water,” will be released in December, and stars Kate Winslet as Ronal, the leader of the Metkayina, a lesser-known clan of the Na’vi tribe. It marks Cameron and Winslet reuniting for the first time since “Titanic,” which was released in 1997. The untitled third “Avatar” film, which was shot back-to-back with the sequel, is set to hit theaters in 2024. Cameron, 67, admitted he’s excited to see the storyline develop with each sequel. “Everything I need to say about family, about sustainability, about climate, about the natural world, the themes that are important to me in real life and in my cinematic life, I can say on this canvas,” he told Empire. “I got more excited as I went along. Movie four is a corker. It’s a motherf—er. I actually hope I get to make it. But it depends on market forces. Three is in the can so it’s coming out regardless. I really hope that we get to make four and five because it’s one big story, ultimately.” “Avatar” is the highest-grossing movie of all time at the global box office with $2.84 billion. “Avatar: The Way of Water” opens in theaters Dec. 16.
