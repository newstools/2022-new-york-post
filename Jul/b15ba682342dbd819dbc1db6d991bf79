Does Giancarlo Stanton have a new lady in his life? The Yankees slugger, 32, was seen with actress Priscilla Quintana at a club following Tuesday’s MLB All-Star Game in Los Angeles, according to SideAction.com. Stanton, who was named the game’s MVP, was seen smiling beside the 29-year-old Quintana in photos obtained by the site, which reported that the pair is an item. Quintana also took to her Instagram stories to congratulate Stanton on his MVP performance. In the since-expired post that featured a photo of Stanton, the actress tagged the five-time All-Star alongside a white heart emoji. Stanton and Quintana have yet to address or confirm a potential romance as of Friday. The rumored couple does follow one another on Instagram, however, and Amy Cole, the wife of Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole, also follows the actress. Quintana, who is also a model, stars in the science fiction series “Pandora,” as well as the Freeform drama “Good Trouble.” The actress appears to have been a Yankees fan prior to being linked to Stanton. In fact, one of her Instagram posts from last June shows her sporting a blue New York hat. As for Stanton, he is only the third Yankee to win the All-Star MVP Award, joining legends Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. Stanton hit a 457-foot moonshot for a two-run home run that helped the American League knock off the National League, 3-2, in the All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium. It marked his first All-Star appearance for the Yankees since they acquired him from the Marlins before the 2018 season.
