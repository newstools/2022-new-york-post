Shots rang out in front of St. Patrick’s Cathedral during an apparent car chase, police sources said. No one was hurt during the early Saturday gunplay, and investigators recovered three .40 caliber shell casings at the scene, the sources said. Midtown North Precinct patrol units were on post in front of the Cathedral at East 51st Street and Fifth Avenue just before 6 a.m. when officers heard three shots being fired. Two officers heard tires shriek and saw one vehicle turn left from Fifth Avenue onto East 52nd Street and continue to head eastbound, the sources said. A black Mercedes Benz with unknown plates that appeared to be following the first vehicle continued southbound and swerved in front of 647 Fifth Avenue, when the gunfire broke out, the sources said. A cop canvass in front of that Fifth Avenue address turned up the three .40 caliber shell casings, the sources said. The Midtown icon has been under heavy guard amid protests in the Big Apple following last month’s overturning of the landmark Roe v Wade ruling that protected women’s rights to abortion for nearly 50 years.
