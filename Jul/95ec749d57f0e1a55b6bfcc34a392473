The SUV used in the drive-by shooting of a Queens stroller mom appears tied to a weed robbery a day earlier, cops said Sunday —  adding the young woman seems to have been the intended target in the second crime. The 28-year-old mom was standing outside 15-02 Mott Ave. in Far Rockaway with her two young children, ages 2 and 5, when she was shot in the back and the arm Friday evening, police said. The baby was in a stroller next to her at the time. Neither child was hurt, cops said. A 44-year-old man who was standing nearby was also struck by a bullet in the arm. The two victims did not know each other, cops said. Police added Sunday that it appears the woman was the intended target, given that the shooter pulled up in the black, four-door SUV right alongside her before opening fire. Police said the same getaway vehicle is believed to be the one used in the robbery of $7,000 of marijuana and $2,000 cash from Ocean Park Market on Seagirt Boulevard on Thursday. A man walked into the market around 9 p.m. and demanded money and drugs from the clerk who was inside. “Don’t move, or I’ll shoot!” the robber said, according to cops. “Give us all your weed and all your money.” The robber fled in a black four-door SUV. Cops released a photo of the SUV used in the shooting Saturday.
