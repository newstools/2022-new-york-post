A Texas professor was being scrutinized after an appeal to find a “cure for homosexuality,” along with the bizarre suggestion that doctors try to identify gay babies during prenatal testing. Professor Timothy Farage is under investigation by The University of Texas at Dallas after a tweet that made misleading claims about an alleged link to homosexuality and monkeypox. “Can we at least try to find a cure for homosexuality, especially among men,” the computer science professor wrote. Farage insisted he has “nothing against homosexuals” during an interview with WFAA-TV, but suggested we try to find a “cure” to change someone’s sexual preference. “I’m saying, do medical research on the causes for homosexuality,” he said while suggesting that the supposed testing could be administered in the womb. Farage then admitted: “I don’t know, I’m not a doctor.” The Rainbow Coalition, an LGBTQ+ student organization at UT Dallas, called on the university to take “immediate action” against Professor Timothy Farage, for the since-deleted post. “Farage has a long, well-documented history of hostility on LGBTQ+ issues,” they said in a tweet. “He has been known to discuss controversial political positions and promote personal social media account during lectures, which goes against university guidelines for professor’s conduct.” The university “received several complaints” and said the incident was under investigation. “We take this matter seriously and that the statements by this individual do not reflect the core values of our institution,” the university said in a statement. Farage appears to have deactivated the Twitter account after he made the controversial remarks but was active on his Facebook account as recently as Tuesday. Meanwhile, the university offered students the opportunity to take classes with another professor. Farage did not reply to The Post’s request for comment.
