This Florida residence is decadent, but the add-ons it comes with are on another level entirely. This $22.5 million home in the Miami luxury tower Turnberry Ocean Club Residences offers 6,225 square feet of space, including a 1,300-square-foot terrace — and exclusive memberships to a private marina, an airport and two championship golf courses. Designed by Nick Luaces Design Associates, “design firm to the wealthiest Miami neighborhoods,” this Sky Residence apartment features four bedrooms, 6½ baths, staff quarters, a den and, of course, entry into those various amenities that are so big they’re more often considered municipal assets. Specifically, buyers of this unit — which features a hybrid floor plan combining what were once two separate residences — get to enjoy a one-year social membership to two golf courses, a tennis center, the Himalayan salt room-equipped AME Spa, the South Florida waterpark Tidal Cove and multiple members-only dining options. The new apartment owners will also be able to get priority access and special rates at the private, 117-dock Turnberry Marina — as well as priority access, “aircraft maintenance” and more at the Opa-Locka Executive Airport, according to press materials shared with The Post. At the property, the homeowners will also be able to relax at an onsite beach cabana. “The open-space floor plan adds rotating floor-to-ceiling wooden panels that swivel into a wall or compartmentalize away to offer privacy when desired,” the press materials add. “Additionally, the Sky Residence offers a triple-kitchen island, Snaidero cabinetry, chevron flooring and tray ceilings as well as unobstructed Atlantic views. Sales at the 52-story Carlos Zapata-designed property began in October 2014, at which time the Real Deal reported about “two-thirds of the buyers have been South American and European.” The 154 apartments range from three- to six-bedrooms. The residences were developed by Jeffrey Soffer.
