Elon Musk didn’t let a rough week hold him back. Exclusive images show the world’s richest man out in public for the first time since he was sued by Twitter after he dropped his $44 billion bid to buy the social media company. A disheveled Musk, 51, was spotted heading to dinner Wednesday night in Los Angeles during a week in which he made headlines because of the Twitter lawsuit and an ongoing online beef with former President Donald Trump. The quirky Tesla and SpaceX founder is seen in images obtained by The Post getting out of the passenger side of a Tesla, in a button-down white shirt with his sleeves rolled up, looking glum. A bodyguard stands nearby as he slips on a jacket and heads inside tieless, the photos show. Twitter sued the outspoken billionaire on Tuesday for backing out of the takeover, claiming Musk tried to “trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value and walk away.” Musk has also been trading social media jabs with Trump in a spat that’s been brewing since Musk suggested he’d support Ron DeSantis if the Florida governor runs for president in 2024. Trump had also blasted Musk as “another bulls—t artist” at a rally in Alaska, leading Musk to say Trump was too old to run for office and suggest he should “hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.” That sparked Trump to attack Musk and claim that when he was president, he could have made Musk “drop to [his] knees and beg.” Musk’s rough stretch also included a rocket booster that went up in flames this week at a SpaceX plant, likely delaying a plan to launch its Starship spacecraft this year.
