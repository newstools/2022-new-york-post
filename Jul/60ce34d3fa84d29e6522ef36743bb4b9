A third man has been charged in a rapper’s fatal shooting at a Midtown Manhattan recording studio in May, cops said. Justin Rodriguez, 18, was arrested for the murder of 34-year-old Kamir King in the makeshift studio on West 37th Street near Ninth Avenue shortly after midnight on May 5, police said. Rodriguez, of Staten Island, was arrested just days after the arrest of Daniel Williams, 21, of New Jersey. The first suspect arrested in the case was Kabal Reyes, also of New Jersey. King was believed to have been targeted in an attempted robbery, law enforcement sources have said. A second man, Devon Dillahunt, 24, was found dead outside the studio at the time. But police sources have said it appears he accidentally shot himself. His potential connection to the homicide wasn’t clear. Multiple people were hanging out at the music studio when four people showed up and gunshots rang out, according to cops and sources. At the time, police sources said an unspecified amount of money and marijuana was found in the studio.
