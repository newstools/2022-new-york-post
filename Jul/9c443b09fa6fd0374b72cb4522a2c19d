Washington star outfielder Juan Soto exited Sunday’s loss against the Miami Marlins with a left calf injury, the Nationals announced. He underwent an MRI after the game. The injury seemed to occur in the third inning when Soto pointed at his calf after making a throw from the outfield. Soto was later taken out in the fourth inning. “We’ll reevaluate him and see what’s going on,” manager Dave Martinez told reporters postgame. Soto has been hot as of recently before his injury. The outfielder went on an eight-game hitting streak before being walked twice Sunday. The lack of Soto’s presence won’t help Washington, either. The Nationals are currently dead last in the NL East with a 29-52 record. “Oh, yeah, it’s terrifying, obviously,” Nationals first baseman Josh Bell said. “Fingers crossed that it’s not anything too, too time-consuming. We’ll see. I know he’s probably going to get the results back here soon. I know we’re all holding our breath for him. I guess time will tell.”
