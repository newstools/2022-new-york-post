A woman was stabbed to death by her teen brother in her Brooklyn home late Sunday, authorities said. The 17-year-old boy knifed his sister Shanelle Colquhoun, 26, in the neck and arms during a “domestic incident” inside the East Flatbush home on Beverley Road near East 48th Street around 11:30 p.m., cops said. Colquhoun was rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead. The teen, whose name was not immediately released, was taken into custody and charges were still pending by the morning. He does not have a criminal history, but may have an “emotionally disturbed person” background, cops said.
