Tom Brady now has another Pro Bowler to throw to. The Buccaneers are signing Julio Jones to a one-year contract, according to multiple reports. Jones, 33, was a free agent after being released by the Titans in March. Jones, a seven-time Pro Bowler, spent one season with Tennessee after 10 years with the Falcons. He had a disappointing 2021 season, making 31 receptions for 434 yards with one touchdown in 10 games. Tampa Bay’s signing of Jones comes on the heels of the team adding former Giants tight end Kyle Rudolph. The Buccaneers now boast a receiver trio of Jones, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. It is unclear, however, when Godwin will be ready to return after tearing his ACL at the end of last season.
