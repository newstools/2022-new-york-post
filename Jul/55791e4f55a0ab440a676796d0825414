Costco has reportedly raised the prices on two of its food court items. According to Business Insider, the national price hikes on its chicken bake and 20-ounce soda were confirmed by a location in Rochester, New York, as well as food courts in other locations. The chicken bake now sells for $1 more than in June, at $3.99. The price of the soda has increased by 10 cents, up to $0.69. According to research compiled by Wells Fargo ahead of the Fourth of July holiday – using data from Urner Barry, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Nielsen and Bureau of Labor Statistics – chicken prices have soared this year. Retail prices for wings and chicken breasts are up 38% and 24.3%, respectively. The bank said that soda prices are also up 13% from last year, as well as competing beverage favorites. Last week, Costco Wholesale Corporation reported net sales of $22.78 billion for the retail month of June. That marks an increase of 20.4% from $18.92 billion last year. For the 44 weeks ended July 3, 2022, the company reported net sales of $188.34 billion, or an increase of 16.9% from $161.09 billion during the same period in 2021. The retail giant did not immediately return FOX Business’ request for comment.
