Mayor Eric Adams is marching to the beat of his own drummer. Adams, 61, got behind a street musician’s set for a quick drum lesson that turned into an impromptu jam session at a COVID-19 testing site in the Big Apple. The Democrat shared a 52-second clip of the musical moment on Twitter Wednesday,  captioned, “I know the rhythm of this city!” An unidentified drummer showed the mayor how to keep basic time on the hi-hat before teaching him a rudimentary beat using the kick drum and snare, footage showed. Once Adam locked into the beat, the musician –wearing a Brooklyn Nets jersey — started to freestyle as onlookers cheered. “Eric Adams on the drums right now and he’s playing around. One. One. One two, y’all,” he rapped as Adams splashed the cymbals and attempted a fill. “You the coolest dude man, you the coolest mayor man,” the drummer told Hizzoner as Adams walked away from the set, grinning from ear to ear. “Put some money in the bucket,” Adams told the crowd. “Put some money in the bucket, you heard the man!” the busker impelled bystanders.
