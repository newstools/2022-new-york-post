Rams star receiver Cooper Kupp isn’t much of a fan of the glitz and glam that comes with being a Super Bowl champion. Although Kupp has enjoyed his post-championship offseason — from celebrating at the Rams’ Super Bowl parade to attending the ESPY Awards — the receiver said he “despises red carpets.” “I can’t stand them,” Kupp said of the step and repeat. “I hate getting dressed up.” Kupp, though, appeared happier than ever at the 2022 ESPY Awards last Wednesday, when he sported a stylish satin suit that featured a deep blue floral pattern. His wife, Anna, stunned in a black cut-out dress. The 29-year-old wideout later took to the stage at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood to collect two ESPY Awards for Best NFL Player and Best Championship Performance. He also thanked his wife in his acceptance speech. Kupp and Anna began dating as seniors in high school after connecting at a track meet. They went on to tie the knot in 2015, while they were in college — and later welcomed two sons, Cooper, 3, and Cypress, 1. Kupp took home the Super Bowl MVP trophy in February after helping make the game-winning pass that secured the Rams’ 23-20 victory over the Bengals. He also scored two touchdowns in the big game. In June, Kupp and the Rams reached an agreement on a three-year extension worth $110 million that ties him to Los Angeles for the next five years. Kupp and the defending champions will open the 2022 regular season against the Bills on Sept. 8.
