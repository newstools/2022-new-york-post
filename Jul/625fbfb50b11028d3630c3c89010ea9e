The Manhattan bodega worker charged with murder after fighting off a violent ex-con in his store over the weekend was finally home Thursday night after he was released on bail. Jose Alba, 61, arrived at his Hamilton Heights apartment around 8:30 p.m. wearing an electronic monitor hours after a Manhattan judge agreed to lower his sky-high bail from $250,000 to $50,000. Alba, who was accompanied by one of his sons, covered his face and refused to answer questions as he went inside. Before his release, Alba had been locked up at Rikers Island on a murder rap for his fatal encounter with Austin Simon, 35, on Friday night inside the Hamilton Heights bodega where he works. Relatives and Alba’s boss posted $5,000 needed to spring him on a bail bond. As part of his release agreement, Alba is also barred from leaving New York City and he had to surrender his passport, ensuring he will not be going to the Dominican Republic on a previously planned trip. Alba was working at the Hamilton Heights Grocery on Broadway when he was attacked by Simon, a career criminal with a history of violence who stormed behind the counter and shoved him into a wall, the video shows. The ex-con then grabbed Alba as the frightened clerk tried to get past him — getting his hands on a knife and plunging it into Simon at least five times. Simon’s girlfriend allegedly also pulled a knife from her purse and stabbed Alba three times in the shoulder and hand, according to his attorney. She has not been charged, with the DA’s Office saying only “we are continuing to review the evidence and the investigation is ongoing.” Alba can be seen in the footage bleeding from his stab wounds and holding his knife as he waits for police to arrive — only to have them arrest him and take him into custody.
