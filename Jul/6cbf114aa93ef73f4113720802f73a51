They share the same jeans. Fashion Influencer Sasha Morpeth, 22, inherited her 60-year-old mom Therese Morpeth’s good looks and great fashion sense and the pair looks more like sisters than they do mother and daughter. The duo, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, model a series of sexy age-defying looks on Sasha’s TikTok, where a recent video highlighting “fashion for all ages” racked up over 1 million views. In the featured video, the blonde bombshells stun in matching black pantsuits with white tank tops underneath to give their looks a polished and youthful flair. For their next look, Sasha and Therese reveal matching beige form fitting dresses embellished with a ruched neckline to give the streamlined dresses a feminine touch. In their next getup, the mom and daughter look ready for a sporty day out in flirty and casual hot pink shirts paired with classic light blue jeans. For their final age appropriate twin ensemble, the mom and daughter show off their fit bodies in classy brown one-shoulder puffy sleeved dresses with high slits on both their legs. With outfits like these, It comes as no surprise that social media users flooded Sasha’s TikTok with supportive comments after she posted the video of her and her fashionable mom. “I’m so blown away by yall beautiful. #goals for sure!” wrote Blainstagram. “Love this! Fashion has no age ,” Emily dos Santos chimed in. “You guys both slayed,” said i’m a wife . Sasha posts countless videos of her and her fashionable mom on TikTok that similarly attract a lot of attention proving that style has no expiration date and that it’s possible to look amazing at any age.
