Willie Garson, the late actor who charmed viewers as Stanford Blatch in “Sex and the City,” has left more than his screen legacy for fans in the wake of his 2021 death. His Los Angeles home — which, like Blatch, also comes with plenty of character — has just hit the market for $1.69 million, its listing brokerage told The Post. Located in Valley Village, in the San Fernando Valley, the Spanish-style residence has three bedrooms and stands on a 10,250-square-foot lot. Dating to the 1920s, the house itself offers 1,639 square feet of living space. The listing images show a simple exterior accented with a fiery bougainvillea and small palm trees. A wooden door leads inside, where a living room with a fireplace stands under a vaulted, beamed ceiling. That room is accessed via an arched doorway and also includes arched built-in bookshelves. Off to another side is the formal dining room that opens to the kitchen — whose walls are painted in a pastel yellow — which has stainless steel appliances and custom cabinets. That formal dining area, meanwhile, is also accessed via an arched doorway and has an arched window that lets in light. The primary bedroom has an ensuite bathroom with a steam shower and, elsewhere, the property’s detached garage was converted into a pool house, but can be used as flexible space for an office. That said, beyond fruit trees and other mature plantings, there’s a pool and spa outside. Bryan Abrams, of Sotheby’s International Realty — Sherman Oaks Brokerage — has the listing. Garson passed away in September 2021 at age 57, with initial reports saying he died amid a cancer battle. Several days later, his family wrote that he died of pancreatic cancer — and it appears that he passed in this home that’s now listed. Beyond the always-buzzy “Sex and the City,” Garson — who left behind his adopted son Nathen — appeared in more than 300 TV shows and 70 films.
