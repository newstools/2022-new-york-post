The Jets roster is unlikely to change much before training camp opens on July 27. Yes, Joe Douglas still could add a veteran linebacker or tackle, and that would lead to a corresponding player getting cut. But, for the most part, the current Jets roster is going to be the one that opens camp. With that in mind, let’s take a look at all 90 players with a thought about each: Keshunn Abram, WR: An undrafted free agent who showed big-play ability in college. Fighting for a practice-squad spot. Tony Adams, S: The Jets have some depth at safety, so it will be tough for the undrafted rookie (Illinois) to make the team. He must stand out on special teams.
