It figured that the Giants would be interested in adding to their safety position, given the lack of proven players on the depth chart. They picked up someone who is no stranger to their team or their building, as they will sign Andrew Adams just in time for the start of training camp. Veterans report on Tuesday, with the first practice set for Wednesday morning. Adams, 29, will be on the scene. The Giants held a tryout on Monday, with tight end Eric Ebron — a first-round pick of the Lions in 2014 — and offensive tackle Kendall Lamm among the participating players. Adams was also in attendance and the Giants liked what they saw. Adams came to the Giants in 2016, undrafted out of UConn, and ended up starting 13 games as a rookie. His first NFL interception, coming off Carson Wentz, helped the Giants to a victory over the Eagles in Week 9 that season. A valuable special teams contributor, Adams played in all 16 games in 2017 for the Giants before moving on to the Buccaneers. Adams picked up four of his seven career interceptions during the 2018 season and ended up winning a Super Bowl following the 2020 season — he played in all 16 regular-season games and all four postseason games. Intertwined with his four years in Tampa, Adams signed with the Lions (2019) and then the Eagles (2021) but was waived prior to the season both times. He returned to the Buccaneers for a third time last season, starting three of the 14 games he appeared in. Adams should make a strong push to make the Giants’ roster. Big Blue has Xavier McKinney and Julian Love as the starting safeties and not much after that. They drafted Dane Belton out of Iowa in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL Draft and moved cornerback Jarren Williams to safety in the spring.
