Get out of her hair! Grace Rivers, 20, doesn’t shave, and recently posted a video to her TikTok exposing people’s harsh comments about her grooming habits. Luckily, Rivers never lets these insults get her down in the pits because she always has a comeback in the nick of time. “Oh my God, when was the last time you shaved?!” someone once asked Rivers. “Never,” Rivers answered cheekily. “No man is ever gonna want you,” said one of her haters. Her reply? “I’m gay.” “That’s so disgusting and unhygienic,” someone said. “Well, then, men are disgusting,” Rivers retorted. Rivers’ fellow TikTokers flooded her video with supportive comments. “i don’t shave either, and if a man doesn’t want me because of that, I’m happy to avoid him,” wrote Im ruining my life. “I love my body hair so much I can’t believe I was ever convinced to part with it,” said Shalva. “If we are supposed to be shaven, our bodies would be naturally hairless,” wrote Brooklyn Stuff. Rivers is just one of multitudes of Gen Z women growing out their body hair. Back in March, Model Sydney Jordan told The Post she loses out on some fashion gigs because she refuses to shave.
