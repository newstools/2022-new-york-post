It was an all-in move, a boom-or-bust trade that sent All-Star center Rudy Gobert from the Jazz to the Timberwolves for four future first-round picks, 2022 first-round selection Walker Kessler (No. 22 overall) and established NBA players Malik Beasley and Patrick Beverley. Whether or not the deal works out for Minnesota, it was a reminder of what it will take for the Knicks and Leon Rose to land another true difference-maker, either now or in the near future, to elevate a roster that, while improved, still is nowhere near the top of the Eastern Conference. Much has been made of the Knicks’ assets — 11 first-round picks in the next seven drafts, young players such as RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, Obi Toppin and Quentin Grimes — after Rose’s wheeling and dealing on draft night saw the team trade out of the first round completely. It gives the Knicks a shot, at least a theoretical one, to make a big move if a top player, such as Donovan Mitchell, becomes available. But it’s unclear if the war chest of picks and players the Knicks now have will satisfy the cost.
