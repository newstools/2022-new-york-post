Tennis influencer Rachel Stuhlmann recounted an emotional time playing the game in college when asked about her time at the University of Missouri in a Q&A on Instagram. When asked who was the best player she faced at Mizzou, Stuhlmann, 26, shared a photo of herself seemingly crying with her head in her hands on the court. “Umm I think it was when I played the #8 in the nation. I actually had a match point, and lost,” Stuhlmann wrote, adding a teary-eyed emoji. Stuhlmann, who began playing tennis at the age of 5, was highly recruited out of high school and committed to her native Missouri over LSU, Colorado, Texas Tech and Penn State. She stopped playing tennis after college, and immersed herself in the tennis world as a journalist, influencer and media personality. Later on in the Instagram Q&A, Stuhlmann said she would love to play mixed doubles with Rafael Nadal and Nick Kyrgios. On Thursday, Nadal withdrew from Wimbledon due to an abdominal tear. Nadal had been slated to face Kyrgios in the semifinals in pursuit of his third Wimbledon title. Now Kyrgios advances to the finals of the major, where he will face Novak Djokovic after he defeated Cameron Norrie. Stuhlmann said she is “pulling for Kyrgios,” who she would “definitely” like to see win the 2022 championships.
