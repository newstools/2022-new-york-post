Nestor Cortes’ unforgettable All-Star week came to a memorable end on Tuesday night. Shortly after showcasing some crafty pitching in a scoreless sixth inning in the 2022 All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium, Cortes kept the good vibes going by proposing to girlfriend, Alondra G. Esteras Russy following the midsummer classic. The 27-year-old Yankees pitcher broke the news to his 140,000 Instagram followers on Wednesday, sharing several pics of the week’s festivities alongside heartwarming photos of the two. “All Star week made 2 of my dreams come true,” Cortes wrote. “Pitch in a all star game. And propose to my bestfriend. With my parents along my side. I had to make us official.” Russy confirmed the proposal with a post of her own, showcasing the intimate moment and her new diamond ring with the caption “Of course i said YES !” Cortes looked to have gotten down on one knee at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art installation titled “Urban Light.” The location was quite fitting for the lefty, who has showcased his masterful ability to paint the corners of the plate while pitching in The Bronx this year. With these magical moments both on and off the field now behind him, Cortes will look to add another ring to his collection with the Yankees in October.
