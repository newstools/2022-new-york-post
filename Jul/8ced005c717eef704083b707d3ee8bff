The 2022 Oscars — yes, the ceremony during which Will Smith slapped Chris Rock — are nominated for an Emmy. The 94th Academy Awards received the nod for Best Variety Special, Live on Tuesday in a livestream hosted by Melissa Fumero and J.B. Smoove, who both star in the upcoming Netflix comedy “Blockbuster.” The event will compete against the Grammys, the Tonys, the Super Bowl Halftime Show, and “Live in Front of a Studio Audience: The Facts Of Life and Diff’rent Strokes” for the golden statue. As a refresher, Smith ran onstage at the award ceremony on March 27 and slapped host Rock across the face for making a joke about wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head. She shaved her head in 2021 due to struggles with alopecia. Rock reportedly did not know about her medical condition. At the time, attendees thought the slap — which has its own Wikipedia page — was a bit, but quickly realized Smith was actually upset when he returned to his seat and yelled, “Keep my wife’s name out your f- -king mouth!” Shortly after, an emotional and apologetic Smith, 53, returned to the stage to accept his first-ever Oscar win for Best Actor for the Venus and Serena Williams biopic “King Richard.” Even though he celebrated that night by singing his own songs with his award in hand at an after-party, Smith later resigned from the Academy. He is banned from attending the Oscars for the next 10 years. As for 57-year-old Rock, ABC executive Craig Erich told Deadline that he is open to having the funnyman host the 2023 Oscars. The 74th Emmy Awards take place on Monday, Sept. 12, 2022, in Los Angeles and can be watched on NBC.
