Pick a Card, any Card. The Cardinals can draw an ace and win the NL Central, draw a king and make the postseason as a wild card, or draw a joker and miss the playoffs completely. St. Louis is at Cincinnati on Sunday. Tyler Mahle (3-7, 4.48) starts for the Reds. When Mahle brings his “A” game, he gives the anemic Reds lineup a chance. When Mahle gets mauled, as has been the case lately, Cincy has no chance. He has allowed nine runs over his last 17 ²/₃ innings and has won once in his last nine starts. The Cards’ Miles Mikolas (7-7, 2.54) has won his last two starts, limiting the opposition to two runs over 14 ¹/₃ innings total. You know where this joker is going. Play 10 units on the Cardinals. Julio Urias allowed two hits over six innings, Mookie Betts, Trea Turner and Freddie Freeman homered, and the Dodgers held off the Giants, 4-2. Winner. Up +1,903 drysdales.
