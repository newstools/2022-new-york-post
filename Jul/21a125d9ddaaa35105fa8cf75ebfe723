The White Sox and Tigers are set to begin a four-game series tonight in Chicago (8:10 p.m. ET) and Munaf Manji of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). Although the Tigers arrive in Chicago on a four-game winning streak, they’ve struggled mightily against the White Sox this season. In six games, the White Sox are 5-1 against Detroit and have a +32 run differential in those contests. For Manji, he expects that level of dominance to continue Thursday night for the White Sox, who will send Dylan Cease to the mound. “Over his last five games, Cease is 3-1 with a 0.65 ERA,” Manji says. “And this season against the Detroit Tigers, Cease is 2-0 with a 0.97 ERA.” Plus, in 10 career games behind Cease against the Tigers, the White Sox are a perfect 10-0 and have won all 10 of those games by at least two runs. Just in the two games this season, the White have produced victories by four and three runs in such situations. On the flip-side, the Tigers will send Beau Brieske to the mound Thursday. Entering tonight’s contest, Brieske is a negative regression candidate — his ERA currently sits at 4.54 but his xERA comes in at 5.85. Plus, Manji explains that Brieske is even more unreliable on the road this season. In five starts, the right-hander is 0-5 with an ERA of 6.09. For all those reasons, Manji recommends backing the White Sox on the run-line at -125 on BetMGM.
