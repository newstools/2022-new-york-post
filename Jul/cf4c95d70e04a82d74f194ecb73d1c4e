If you’ve ever been scrolling through TikTok, ignoring all the chores you’re meant to be doing and wondering just how much your favorite influencers are making with dance and comedy videos — the question has been answered, and the answer is: a lot. Hopper HQ — social media scheduling site — has put together a top 10 ‘rich list’ of TikTok influencers, and the amount they make per post will make your eyes water.  This 18-year-old dancing queen from the USA earns a whopping $151,411 for every sponsored post she shares with her 142.4 million followers. The success has left her with a net worth of $28,625,600. She rose to fame after she started using her professional dance skills to create short dance videos on TikTok — and it doesn’t hurt that she’s also a knockout. That might sound easy enough, but me and my two left feet could simply never. D’Amelio started dancing when she was three, and participated in competitions for over ten years. However, it’s sponsorships that earn her the real money. She’s partnered with big brands such as Invisalign, Morphe, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Hollister.  Despite having recently become the TikTok influencer with the largest following (a whopping 143.2 million people), Lame is coming in second on the rich list. Each of the Senegal-born comedian’s sponsored posts earn $131,999 each, with a net worth of $7,150,050. His videos are hilarious, mocking some of the more absurd ‘top tip’ videos circulating the platform, and creating original short skits.  With 90.1 million followers and a net worth of $2,861,460, Poarch shot to fame thanks to her video lip-synching to the song M to the B, which is now TikTok’s most like post. The Filipino-American creator and singer pulls in $95,614 per sponsored post.  Rae might have made it to the movies (she starred in Netflix’s He’s All That, and has a multi-movie deal with them), but she started her fame on TikTok, thanks to 87.9 million followers. She might not be top of this list, earning $93,253 per post, but her net worth of $21,459,900 thanks to some juicy sponsorship deals with brands like American Eagle got her on Forbes’ 2020 30 Under 30 list.  Smith seems to be one of the few celebrities who made their fame outside social media doing TikTok right. With everything from humorous videos to sneak peeks into his celebrity family life, 72.3 million followers tune in. He’s earning $76,922 per post, but his net worth is at a whopping $429,063,000, for obvious Hollywood reasons. You can check out the full top 10 list of TikTokkers making the most here.
