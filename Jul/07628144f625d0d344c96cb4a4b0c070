RJ Barrett likes what he sees — even if he’s had to delete a tweet about it. The Knicks’ rising star guard shared his approval of a few Knicks moves in 2022 NBA free agency. “Money Mitch,” he tweeted, along with a pair of “I love you” hand-gesture emoji, after the team brought back center Mitchell Robinson on a reported four-year, $60 million deal. On Thursday, in the early minutes of free agency, the 22-year-old tweeted — then deleted — the “eyes” emoji over a quote-tweet of the Knicks signing Jalen Brunson. Why it was canned is not known at this point, though Barrett will have plenty of time to sort it out with his new running mate, who agreed to a four-year, $104 million deal at the onset of the market opening. The team also added center Isaiah Hartenstein on Thursday, though Barrett, who celebrated his birthday on Jun. 14, has yet to acknowledge the move.
