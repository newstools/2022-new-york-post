On Saturday, the U.S. Open Twitter account went full heel in a Twitter battle instigated by a Seahawks fan. “Not a sport,” a Seahawks fan account replied to a video of a slick between-the-legs serve from Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon. “not a sport says the person about to watch 17 games of Drew Lock at QB,” the person manning the U.S. Open Twitter account responded. Lock, 25, is expected to take over the reins as the starting quarterback for the Seahawks after they enjoyed a long run of success with Russell Wilson, including one Super Bowl title. Lock, who was part of the trade that brought Wilson to Denver, has played in 24 NFL games, completing 59.5% of his passes with 25 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. Lock seemingly opted to laugh at the tweet — and himself — on Monday. “Happy 4th to all but especially to the intern at the @usopen,” he wrote along with an American flag, a crying-laughing emoji and a heart. One of his new Seattle receivers, DK Metcalf, showed he’s already got Lock’s back. “Aight Chill we get the point @usopen,” the speedster wrote. The thought of going against a shredded Metcalf — 6-foot-4, 230 pounds — was enough to draw a ceasefire from whomever was behind the grand slam tennis account. “after reviewing your photo from before the draft… we agree,” the U.S. Open responded. Whether Lock will actually be the starter come the fall is unknown. He is at the start of an offseason competition with veteran Geno Smith and the Seahawks have been linked to estranged Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield for several months now. Although, it appears Metcalf and the rest of the Seahawks offense is prepared to move forward with Lock or Smith, as they prepare for life after their longtime franchise signal-caller. The Seahawks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2017 last season.
