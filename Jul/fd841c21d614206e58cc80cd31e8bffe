Fresh off two straight wins, the White Sox are still looking to right the ship on their season. At 48-48, Chicago has been a major disappointment after many expected them to be World Series contenders. Perhaps no one more disappointing on their roster is starter Michael Kopech. Last season. Kopech had a ridiculous 36.1% strikeout rate, which ranked in the top 3% across all of Major League Baseball. This season, Kopech has seen his strikeout rate plummet to 21.6%. On June 12th, Kopech hurt his right knee in the first inning of a start. He was unable to throw a warm-up pitch and, “I felt a twinge, pinch or pop or whatever you want to call it. I felt like I couldn’t get on it again. It sounds like it felt worse than what it was” he told MLB.com. He did not miss a start and was immediately cleared. At the time, he had a sparkling 1.92 ERA on the season. Since that game, his ERA is 6.08 in 31.1 innings. A brutal stretch that Kopech will hope some time off during the All-Star break will help heal. Odds provided by BetMGM Spread: CHW -1.5 (+135) vs. COL +1.5 (-160) Moneyline: CHW (-115) vs. COL (-105) Total: Over 11 (-105) | Under (-115) Michael Kopech (3-6, 3.36) vs. Germán Marquez (6-7, 5.47) In Colorado, the Rockies are an offense to be wreckin’ with; outside of Coors Field, not so much. The stats don’t get any better for their pitchers, either. Germán Marquez has a brutal 6.63 ERA at Coors Field, and hitters are batting a wild .311 against him, according to Fangraphs. This is up dramatically from the .228 AVG and 4.20 ERA that he has outside of the hitter’s sanctuary in Denver. In terms of predictions for today’s battle, home run prop bets are likely the play. Kopech had an unbelievable stretch to start the year in not giving up home runs. In fact, he went the first two months of the season without allowing one in 42 innings. Since then, he has allowed 10 home runs in 41 innings, and is walking multiple batters in all but one start since his injury on June 12th. Perhaps some extra time off for Kopech can help him reset as he hasn’t pitched in 11 days, his longest stretch without pitching all year. In that case, he could be a candidate to go over his strikeout total of 4.5 at +117 on Caesars. He hasn’t done it much since the injury, just twice in his last four tries. However, +126 is a pretty wide line, and the White Sox have shown a willingness to let Kopech work despite walking batters and being in trouble. For those targeting FanDuel Sportsbook’s Dinger Tuesday promotion, Tim Anderson is a solid target for this evening’s game. He hits most of his home runs on the road despite having fewer at-bats.  Anderson also has solid peripheral stats, a .454 xSLG, and a 21.7% hard-hit rate. Anderson is not a home-run hitter by any means (only 6 in 68 games), but his stats are on par with his previous seasons, where he went deep at least 17 times when he played an entire season. Kopech ‘over’ 4.5 strikeouts +117 (Caesars) Tim Anderson to hit a home run +450 (FanDuel)
