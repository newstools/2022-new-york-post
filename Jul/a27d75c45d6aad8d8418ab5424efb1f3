There’s something special about having your home truly feel like an extension of you, like finding a chair that suits you or packing your kitchen with gadgets that make your favorite meals. One of the biggest things you can control is your lighting. Change the lighting setup in your home, and you (literally) change how you see everything around you — the Lamp Depot Minimalist LED Corner Floor Lamp is a simple way to do it. This color-changing LED has a big impact in any room it’s in, and for a limited time, it’s also on sale. During our 4th of July Sale, you can get 20% off your purchase if you spend $100 or more, sitewide. You can grab one, two, or four lamps in these available packs!  These LED lamps have a simple design with some incredible potential. Select from 16 million+ colors or 300+ multi-color effects for virtually endless customization. All of this can be controlled from the remote, which lets you shuffle between colors or select your perfect stable lighting. Select muted colors for a softer ambiance or, as one reviewer noted, you can make things a little more flamboyant: “The lights are bright [and] flashy, almost like having a little Vegas boardwalk at the palm of your hands with neon lights.” You can even choose colors that complement or help control your mood. The lamp itself is a simple design. Space-saving, the narrow build can fit behind most furniture and in corners. At the bottom is a wide, rubber-bottom base for stability. Unlit, these lamps are subtle and understated, but at the press of a button, they can dominate a room. Get one Lamp Depot Minimalist LED Corner Floor Lamp for $59.99 (Reg. $149).
