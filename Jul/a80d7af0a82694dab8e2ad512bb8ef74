Lea Michele honored her former boyfriend and “Glee” co-star Cory Monteith Wednesday — the nine-year anniversary of the actor’s death. Michele posted a picture of the duo filming the hit ABC show to her Instagram story, captioning it with a red heart. In the photo, Monteith is wearing a suit and smiling down at Michele, who is gazing up at him, carrying a bouquet of flowers and sporting a blue dress. The couple dated from 2012 until he died of a heroin overdose July 13, 2013. He was 31. “We talked about a lot of things. We talked about children and what we would look like when we grew old, and who would be fat and how we would stay thin,” she told Glamour UK in 2014. “We talked about where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do. We were done. We were it.” This isn’t the first time the future “Funny Girl” leading lady has paid tribute to her former lover. Every year since his death, she’s remembered him in a variety of social media posts. She also has two tattoos dedicated to Monteith: one on her upper thigh says “Finn” which was the name of Monteith’s character on “Glee,” and one on her ribs is the number “5” which represents the number on Finn’s football jersey. Nowadays, Michele is a mother to her nearly 2-year-old son, Ever Leo, with her husband Zandy Reich. The couple celebrated their three-year wedding anniversary in March. On Sept. 6, Michele will start her long-awaited role as Fanny Brice in “Funny Girl” on Broadway. Ticket prices are already up to $2,500 each on SeatGeek for her debut.
