“Spider-Man” stars Zendaya and Tom Holland are taking their relationship to new heights — as they are now house-hunting together, Gimme Shelter has learned. The young power couple was recently spotted in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene/Clinton Hill area, where they toured a home in the $5.35 million range. Zendaya, the Emmy-award-winning “Euphoria” star, was clad in a summer-chic outfit, while Holland was sporting a more casual look, with a “Gilligan’s Island”-style bucket hat. “She looked absolutely stunning,” a spy said. The couple met on the set of “Spider-Man: Homecoming” in 2017 — Zendaya played MJ, the classmate of Holland’s Peter Parker character — and have recently been more upfront about their relationship. They are also kicking it up a notch by adopting a Big Apple dog together — a pit bull named Pistachio, according to reports. Zendaya owns her own Brooklyn condo at Quay Tower, as Gimme Shelter reported exclusively. However, she has also been spotted on the Upper West Side, where Holland has been living in a luxury rental at Waterline Square, as Gimme also reported exclusively. The five-bedroom, 4,400-square-foot townhouse they toured in Brooklyn dates to the 1860s. And, at 22 feet wide, it features plenty of indoor and outdoor space, along with earthy, stone-colored neutral, light-filled interiors. The two have also been spotted together in Boston, where Zendaya was filming “Challengers,“ a romance drama inside the world of competitive tennis. Holland’s next film is “Unchartered” about treasure hunters from PlayStation’s hit video game series, with Mark Wahlberg.
