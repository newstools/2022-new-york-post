A South Australian couple who both fled war-torn Africa have rejoiced after winning one of the state’s biggest lotteries, pulling home a life-changing $4 million. Aristide and Esther Mboneye, who met and married after arriving to Australia separately, bought one ticket in the Hospital Research Foundation Group Home Lottery and couldn’t believe their eyes when they realized they picked the winner. Originally from Burundi in East Africa, Esther’s parents fled for the Congo in the 1970s where she was born. However, increasing turmoil in the region forced the family to rethink their future and make the uncertain journey to Australia in 2005. Aristide also fled civil war in Burundi in 2011. Andrew Costello rang the couple live on SAFM breakfast radio, informing them they had won $1 million each in cash and the deed to a fully-furnished $3 million mansion at Henley Beach on Adelaide’s waterfront. “You’re joking Cosi,” Aristide said. The couple, who both work in the healthcare industry, said they wanted to give back to the community. Aristide is a disability support worker, while Esther works as a nurse. “Our aim was not to win this … it was just to give back to the community,” Aristide said. The Hospital Research Foundation Group is a charity that raises money for medical research and improved facilities in hospitals ‘We’re here from birth, supporting projects in pregnancy health, ultrasound training, improving IVF success rates, equipment for newborns and more,’ its website reads. ‘We’re here at end of life, helping deliver high-quality care within palliative care, aged care, and much-loved pet, art and music therapy.’ The couple plans to use the live-changing haul to visit family back in Burundi. “I still can’t believe it … why us? … I feel like I do not deserve this,” Esther said on Sunrise on Friday morning. “I’m just trying to take everything in. It’s so beautiful.”
