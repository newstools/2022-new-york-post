Former “throuple” pol Katie Hill has filed for bankruptcy after losing her revenge porn lawsuit last year. Hill, who resigned from Congress in 2019 amid a scandal that included leaked nudes of the rising Democratic star, owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to a British tabloid and two conservative journalists that she unsuccessfully sued for publishing the photos without her consent. Last year, the 34-year-old was ordered to pay about $220,000 after losing the case: $105,000 to the parent company the Daily Mail and roughly $84,000 to the attorneys of Jennifer Van Laar, managing editor of the conservative website Red State, and about $30,000 to those representing radio producer Joseph Messina. If her bankruptcy filing is successful, Hill could avoid paying the fees to the defendants, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. She had sued the defendants for publishing or distributing the compromising photos. The nude photos were published as Hill was already embattled in a sex scandal over her “throuple” relationship with her now-ex-husband Kenneth Heslep and a 22-year-old female campaign staffer that ultimately led to her resignation. The lawsuit was thrown out on first amendment grounds, with a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruling that the publication of the images was in the “public interest” as it reflected Hill’s “character” and “qualifications” for office. The judge later ordered the financial judgments. Hill was elected to represent a House district north of Los Angeles that had long been a Republican stronghold in deep blue California. She was celebrated as the face of millennial change and was close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat. She has said since the lawsuit that she is considering another run for office.
