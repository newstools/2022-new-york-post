A naked man jumped to his death from the 16th floor of a posh Upper East Side building Tuesday after apparently bludgeoning a woman to death inside, cops said. The 26-year-old man was found dead in a courtyard behind the co-op at 180 E. 79th St. around 10:30 a.m., police said. A 65-year-old woman was found dead in the bedroom of an apartment on the 16th floor, a police spokesman said. She had trauma to her head. Cops believe the two knew each other. “She’s just one of the most amazing people,” said Martine, who lives next door to the woman who was found dead and declined to give her last name. “I only have good things to say about her. And such a good listener. Always listened to me and my problems. She’s an amazing person,” the 79-year-old said. Numerous residents of the ritzy building called 911 and said they witnessed a naked man either jumping or falling to the courtyard and screaming on his way down, law-enforcement sources said. “It was the loudest thud. At first I thought it was an air conditioning unit… there was workers right across outside my window, I was yelling to them ‘is it an AC unit?’ They’re saying ‘no a guy just jumped down,'” a resident of the building who declined to share his name told The Post. “I looked down and he was right below my window.” The man said the jumper was “butt baked” and his arms were covered in blood. One resident, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, lives a few floors below the apartment where the woman was found dead and heard yelling this morning. “I heard a bunch of voices I thought it was construction workers arguing,” the resident told The Post. “I thought it was just people angry with each other.” Police were investigating the crime as a possible murder-suicide, cops said. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death. Units in the building start at about $1.6 million and go up to $3.5 million, according to listings at StreetEasy.com.
