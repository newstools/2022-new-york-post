Stunning video shows orca whales chomping down on a shark like an all-you-can-eat buffet. Drone footage captures the pod of predators killing a great white shark in South Africa’s Mossel Bay. “I really do think once that footage airs, it’s going to go viral,” scientist Alison Towner, who has recently published a paper on the orcas’ rare targeting of the great white, told The Daily Beast. The clip captures the 9-foot-long apex predator bleeding out as a killer whale takes a bite around its liver. Towner, who has studied the ecology of great white sharks for 15 years, considers the violent footage “one of the most beautiful pieces of natural history ever filmed.” “This is the world’s first drone footage of killer whales predating on a white shark,” she told the outlet. “It’s the first time in South Africa it’s ever been documented as direct evidence.” Scientists have collected data over the years on great white sharks migrating from their habitats, shark carcasses washing up on beaches without livers and changes in the whales’ cycling habits. The killer footage will debut Thursday on Discovery Channel’s “Shark House.“ Mossel Bay was once a popular aggregation site for great whites until the species started disappearing in droves.
