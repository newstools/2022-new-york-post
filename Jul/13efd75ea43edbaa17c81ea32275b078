She was born in the USA — and is the granddaughter of a rock legend. Bruce Springsteen recently became a first-time grandfather. The Boss’ wife, Patti Scialfa, took to Instagram to gush over their new “Jersey Girl,” posting a photo of Lily Harper Springsteen, the daughter of their youngest son, Sam. She shared a black-and-white shot of the newborn’s carriage with Sam, a Jersey City firefighter, and his fiancee smiling behind it. A second photo showed the new bundle of joy wearing pink teddy-bear shaped mittens and a pink hat, still donning her hospital bracelet. Scialfa captioned the post “walking the baby.” Congratulations poured in including from guitarist Tom Morello and actresses Mickey Sumner and Larsen Thompson.
