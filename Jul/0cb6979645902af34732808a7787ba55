Paige VanZant and her husband Austin Vanderford are “not your average couple.” That’s what the bare-knuckle beauty had to say in a video post recently shared on both TikTok and Instagram that featured the couple not only brawling opponents but packing on the PDA with one another. The 28-year-old VanZant can be seen straddling and kissing Vanderford, 32, in a number of cozy photos that are featured in the video collage. VanZant often shares PDA-heavy pics and videos with Vanderford on social media, where she also promotes sultry content on her exclusive fan website. There, fans can pay for photos and videos of the fighter. Vanzant launched her exclusive content site, PaigeFanZant.com, back in March 2021. Currently, VanZant is preparing for her next Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship bout on Aug. 20 in London, where she will face BKFC veteran Charisa Sigala, who is 1-2-1 in bare-knuckle, and 4-2 as an MMA fighter. VanZant is 0-2 since signing with BKFC in August 2020 following her departure from UFC. She also made her pro wrestling debut with All Elite Wrestling at the end of May. VanZant was named to Maxim’s 2022 “Hot 100” list last month, in which the magazine dubbed her a “certified hottie” who is “living the dream.”
