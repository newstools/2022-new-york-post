This markdown magnate isn’t offering any discounts on his palatial Los Angeles residence. George Ruan, who co-founded the coupon-aggregating browser extension Honey in 2012, has put his nine-bedroom Bel-Air home on the market. The tech mogul wants to get $150 million for the 20,000-square-foot spread, which he’s never lived in. Should he succeed, the deal would be among the most expensive in Southern California history, according to the LA Times. Ruan — who sold Honey to PayPal for $4 billion in 2019 — purchased the then-unfinished property for $60 million in 2020, and spent the past two years renovating it. “This home showcases an incredible infinity pool, secluded cabana areas, a pool-side sunken fire pit, an outdoor kitchen and verdant landscaping,” boast press materials about the property, which is listed with Aaron Kirman of the Aaron Kirman Group at Compass. “This home is the pinnacle of luxury, tucked away in the hills, yet conveniently located moments from the world’s most sought-after dining, entertainment and leisure.” Designed by the architecture firm Saota, which has many modern megamansion design credits under its belt, the 14-bathroom compound offers an expansive, new-construction, open-concept minimalist floor plan spread across two stories and 0.5 acres. The main property features a terraced master suite with marble accented dual closets, an ensuite bath with a soaking tub and “dramatic” walls of glass. Clean lines abound in the commercial-sized living areas and the kitchen features honed quartzite countertops. The three separate staff quarters also feature a prep kitchen, as well as a laundry area. Outside, in addition to the main pool, there is a one-bedroom guest house with a second pool. The entry area also has a small pool, and there are additional spa and gym facilities within the property. Whether the views are really “the best” in LA is up for discussion, but they certainly are panoramic.
