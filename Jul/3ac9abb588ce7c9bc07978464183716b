July 19th is National Daiquiri Day and while no one needs a reason to enjoy the delicious rum-based cocktail that’s synonymous with balmy beach days, the holiday is a reason just the same. The origins of the daiquiri date back to 1896, according to Eater. The drink was invented by Jennings Cox, who, according to the website, was living and working in Cuba after the Spanish-American War. It’s believed the cocktail was invented after running out of gin at a party. As the saying goes, “necessity is the mother of invention.” So break out your blender, unpack your punch bowl and ice your glasses. Here are three kicked-up daiquiri recipes to toast today and all summer long.
