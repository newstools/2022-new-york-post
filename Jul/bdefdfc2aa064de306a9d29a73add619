Hair products can take up so much space, especially once you start drying and styling. Why not cut down on clutter and give your routine a makeover with the Cortex Beauty 3-in-1 Hot Air Brush? This heated brush has three configurations to turn it into three totally different tools, and for a limited time, it’s on a major sale for $74.99 down from $249. That’s more than $170 in savings! Normally it would take an independent suitcase to carry everything the Cortex Beauty 3-in-1 can do. With three interchangeable brush head designs, you can plan for different styles or textures for your hair. The Curly Brush can create loose, bouncy curls, or gentle medium waves. The smoothing brush can get rid of pesky flyaways, reduce frizz, and soften your hair. And the blow dryer is a quick way of drying off or adding some volume to your look. The heads aren’t the only thing you can change. This brush comes with three heat settings to customize based on your hair care needs. That heat is released from 360-degree ventilation holes for faster drying and consistent coverage. It also conditions and nourishes damaged hair using negative ion technology. All of this is mounted on a 360º swivel cord that offers flexibility to move freely while you style your hair. One reviewer even writes, “I bought another brush hair dryer but this one is so much better. It dries and styles easily. The shape is very easy to hold and it’s easy to turn on.” When you’re getting ready in the morning, you don’t need to grab a separate device for drying, styling, and defrizzing. Instead, just try this 3-in-1 hot air brush, especially if you need to travel lightly. For a limited time, you can get the Cortex Beauty 3-in-1 Hot Air Brush on sale for $74.99 (Reg. $249). Prices subject to change.
