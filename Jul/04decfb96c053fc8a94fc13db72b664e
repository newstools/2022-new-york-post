If you’re keeping score at home, there’s more evidence to suggest that Jayson Tatum and Ella Mai may be an item. Earlier this week, Tatum and Ella Mai — who have been linked romantically over the past couple of years — were spotted together at Michael Rubin’s star-studded Fourth of July shindig in the Hamptons. Now, the sleuths over at SideAction.com spotted the apparent couple taking in Travis Scott’s concert at Coney Island on Independence Day. Tatum, 24, is coming off a season in which he averaged 26.9 points and 8.0 rebounds per game for the Celtics in the regular season. Tatum and the Celtics ultimately reached the NBA Finals, falling in six games to the Golden State Warriors. Tatum is entering his second year of a five-year, $163 million deal that takes him through the 2025-26 season with Boston. Ella Mai, 27, is a British-born R&B singer who grew up in Queens. Her 2018 self-titled album was certified double platinum by the RIAA. One of the songs from the album, “Boo’d Up” was nominated for two Grammy awards — Best R&B Song and Song of the Year. In 2018, The Post deemed “Boo’d Up” as the song of the summer. “I’ve actually seen videos of people at their weddings singing and dancing to it,” she said at the time, “which really hit home to me ’cause I’m like, ‘Wow, that song’s gonna be a part of their life forever.’”
