There could be a new reason to sweat over COVID-19’s rising rates – even though Big Apple hospitalizations and deaths remain low. Luke O’Neill, a professor of biochemistry at Trinity College in Ireland, warned the new BA.5 variant – now the dominant Omicron subvariant worldwide — could make sleeping difficult in the form of night sweats, The Sun reported. He called the symptom “another curveball” that is a result of the new subvariant colliding with immune systems resulting in a “different disease.” Intense night sweats have been linked to earlier Omicron subvariants.
