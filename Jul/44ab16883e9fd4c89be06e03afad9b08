Oh, the cast of characters who have been invoked in concert with the Knicks splashing out $104 million last week to sign Jalen Brunson. It’s New York City, the spiritual home of point guards, and for the better parts of several decades, the Knicks have been run by the likes of Chris Duhon and Nate Robinson, by Raymond Felton and Pablo Prigioni, Emmanuel Mudiay and Elfrid Payton. I even heard someone mention Allonzo Trier! Or, Brunson is the generations-later heir to Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, their best player at the position since Stephon Marbury, their most credible solution at point guard since the days of Derek Harper if not Mark Jackson. Except.
