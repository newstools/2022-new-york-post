“It’s happening! Everybody stay calm!” Lego’s newest pop culture crossover has turned the iconic people and places of NBC’s “The Office” into its newest play set — and they didn’t skip over any detail. Michael Scott, Pam, Jim, Angela, Dwight and 10 more of of the beloved sitcom’s reccurring characters — except for Andy, who Lego said is working on his “management skills” — have been Lego-fied. Toymakers also included Kevin’s spilled chili, Dwight’s stapler in Jello, and Scott’s “World’s Best Boss” mug. In photos released by Lego, Stanley snacks on his beloved pretzel while Kelly shows her birthday cake. The plastic employees are set in Dunder Mifflin’s most visited spots, including the lobby, the conference room, and Scott’s office. If you’ve been saving your Schrute Bucks, the set is now available for preorder on in the US on Walmart’s website, or internationally via Lego.com. It retails for $119.99 and will be sold in Walmart stores and Lego’s site on October 1. “We didn’t want to hold back on references,” Lego’s Chris Perron said in a statement obtained by The Verge. Jaijai Lewis from Queen has been working on this 1,164-piece set since 2014. His vision finally came to life after it received 10,000 through the Lego Ideas program.
