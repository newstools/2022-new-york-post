Former President Donald Trump called Elon Musk a “bulls–t artist” as he stumped for   Republican midterm candidates in Anchorage, Alaska Saturday night. Trump, 76, told supporters he predicted the world’s richest man would not go through with buying Twitter as he bashed the platform that banned him and promoted his Truth Social social media company. Musk, 51, backed out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company Friday after he claimed it failed to provide information about its fake accounts. Trump also claimed the SpaceX and Tesla boss voted for him and then lied about it. “You know, he said the other day, ‘Oh, I’ve never voted for a Republican.’ I said, ‘I didn’t know that, he told me he voted for me.’ So he’s another bulls–t artist,” the Republican said. The quip came after Musk said last month that he was “leaning” towards supporting GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president in 2024. Trump is said to be strongly considering a third consecutive bid for the presidency. He was joined on stage at his “Save America” rally by US House candidate and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as well as Senate candidate Kelly Tshibaka, who is vying to unseat Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski.
