The 2022 NHL Draft had no shortage of tongue-in-cheek moments. Maveric Lamoureux’s parents, Isabelle and Patrick, stole the spotlight with a makeout session, which was captured on camera as their son was selected 29th overall by the Arizona Coyotes on Thursday night. Lamoureux — a product of the Drummondville Voltigeurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) — appeared to watch the PDA moment unfold as he stood on the draft stage sporting a Coyotes cap. The 6-foot-7, 197-pound right-shooting defenseman appeared stunned while his parents aggressively locked lips — a scene that left announcers on the ESPN broadcast in shock. “Get some,” one broadcaster said, while others laughed. “Hey, we’re in Quebec, get after it.” Twitter critics were quick to weigh in on the PDA moment, with person tweeting, “How about Maveric Lamoureux’s parents stealing his spotlight tonight by giving each other a tongue bath on live television.” Lamoureux’s father was overcome with emotion when SportsNation caught up with him moments after his son lived out his childhood dream of getting drafted in the NHL. “It’s been a long run. We’ve been thinking about this day. Maveric has been a hell of a kid, and he’s been working hard,” said Patrick — a first-round pick of the Granby Bisons in the QMJHL in 1991. “He’s way better than me. He’s got Isabelle’s athleticism.” Isabelle was a gymnast before becoming a coach and training other gymnasts for the highest levels at the national level. “I’m really happy. I’m proud of him,” she said. Lamoureux is the highest-ranked Quebec defender, ranking 20th on the NHL Central Scouting list. “Already at four, five years old, he told us that he was going to play in the NHL,” Isabelle told NHL.com. “We were like, ”Yes, yes, that’s it. Keep going to school.’ We knew there was very little chance.”
