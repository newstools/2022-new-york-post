We’d be lion if we said this optical illusion was easy. In fact, this animal-based optical illusion, in which the object is to spot the odd lion out among the pride, is extra tricky. [Warning: Spoilers Below] According to the Sun, only above-average puzzlers can solve this roaringly fun puzzle, which was created by betting site Casumo in honor of the UK women’s soccer team — named the Lionesses — making it to the 2022 Euros semi-finals this week. In accordance, the illustration features 43 lady lions sporting soccer jerseys and headbands with some of the big cats balancing soccer balls. However, one of these pitch-lounging predators is not like the others when it comes to their coloration (including the tail). Can’t figure out which one? No fear: Casumo provides a handy answer key, which reveals that the soccer-loving Simba sitting fourth from the left in the lower row is the odd lioness out as she’s the only one who’s red with a tan tail. These wildlife-related “Where’s Waldo’s” have become all the rage of late. In another animal-themed brain teaser earlier this month, viewers were challenged to find the baby chicken hidden amongst the bunnies within 30 seconds. Meanwhile, anyone who can find the snake in this illusion within 15 seconds will apparently break a world record. Optical illusions such as this are often just intended as a lighthearted diversion from the stresses of modern life — but they also hold actual scientific value for medical professionals. These brain teasers are credited with helping researchers shed light on the complex inner workings of the human mind and how it reacts to its surroundings. Dr. Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at Goldsmiths University in London, once declared to the Sun that illusions are important to our understanding of the brain: “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you.”
