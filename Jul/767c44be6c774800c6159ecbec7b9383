A 46-year-old man was shot dead at a nude beach outside of Lyon, France, by a fellow beachgoer after he was caught masturbating to a sunbathing woman, authorities said. The man, described by witnesses as an “exhibitionist,” allegedly threatened and insulted several people on La Mama beach before he approached a nude woman and began pleasuring himself around 10:30 a.m. Saturday, police told French news outlets. The pervy nudist allegedly got into a heated argument with another frequent beachgoer and hunter — who is still unnamed by police — who demanded they go to a different location to have their argument. Witnesses stated the younger man refused to move and the 76-year-old hunter then shot him three times — including once in the chest, killing him instantly. Police, who were cycling nearby, heard the gunshots and headed to the scene. The elderly hunter was arrested and taken into custody. Police are still investigating the incident and questioning witnesses.
