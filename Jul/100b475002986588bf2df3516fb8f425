Now that’s a #Girlboss dream house! From minor theft, dumpster diving and nomadic living off the capitalist grid, former “rebel” Sophia Amoruso morphed into the founder of Nasty Gal, an American retailer that launched as an eBay site before filing for bankruptcy and selling for $20 million — far from its $200 million valuation, according to reports — to British retailer Boohoo. Amoruso’s bestselling 2014 autobiography “#GIRLBOSS” also became a Netflix series. She now runs Girlboss Media and has just listed her Hawaiian getaway for $2.97 million. (She bought the property for $1.41 million last year.) Built as a guest house, the one-bedroom, one-bath residence is a mere 516 square feet. Why so pricey? The home is relatively tiny, but it is set on 3 acres — so there is plenty of room to build your dream house, too. The Hawaiian property offers a “Zen-like simplicity,” notes the listing, in a well-designed space surrounded by Kauai’s natural beauty. It features handcrafted koa wood doors with ebony inlay, koa cabinets, mahogany window frames and a vaulted cedar ceiling with ambient lighting, along with a koa wood ladder to the loft space. The residence also boasts a deck with stunning views and fruit trees blooming with Moro blood oranges, kumquats, grapefruits, tangerines, tangelos, Meyer lemons, limes, avocados and more. The property is set at the foot of the mountains of Kauai’s North Shore, in the town of Kīlauea. Beaches are nearby, along with amenities including golf and tennis. Amoruso is selling to focus on “priorities” closer to her home in Cali. The listing broker is Neal Norman, of Hawaii Life.
