Arjan Perovic is crossing his fingers. He’s dreaming of the possibilities. He’s overjoyed that it’s even possible. Not just because of what he is certain it would mean for his hometown Knicks to land Donovan Mitchell. But because of the impact it could have on the city for a homegrown star to return as he enters his prime. “It would be electric. So many kids in New York City look up to Donovan,” Perovic, Mitchell’s AAU coach, told Sports+ in a phone interview. “So many kids would want to come see him play up-close, instead of being able to see him twice a year against the Knicks and the Nets. “The kids having access to him at this point in his career would be crucial. Donovan is approaching his peak, and it would be pretty cool [if he came here].”
