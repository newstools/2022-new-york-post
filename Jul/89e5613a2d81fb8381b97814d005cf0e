We had the Mets when they teed off on Hunter Greene (3-10, 6.01, 98 Ks) and the Reds on the Fourth of July. Cincinnati hosts the Rays on Saturday and Greene is back on the hill. The fireballing rookie crosses into triple digit strikeout territory against Tampa Bay, which is a mediocre 20-20 on the road. Drew Rasmussen (5-3, 3.30) is 2-3 on the road after allowing five runs over his last nine innings away. Taking the home dog Reds and Greene for 10 units. The Fish, fried on Thursday by the score of 10-0, rebounded (much to our dismay) to defeat the Mutts, 5-2. Brandon Nimmo and Francisco Lindor hit solo homers. Chris “STOP TESTING” Bassitt pitched well enough coming off a short bout with COVID-19, but the Mets went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position. Back-to-back losses have us at +1,534 tugmcgraws.
