Dozens of migrants were found in stash houses run by human smugglers in an upscale section of Washington, DC, immigration officials said Thursday. A total of 73 migrants — including 13 children — were hidden in six houses in the city’s northwest section, where the median home price is $750,000, according to NBC News. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers also found $95,000 and a small amount of cocaine in the homes during the bust Wednesday, according to internal documents cited by the outlet. The bust comes on the heels of horrifying recent reports of migrants being subjected to dangerous conditions during their journeys to the US — including an incident in which 53 people suffocated in the back of a sweltering truck in San Antonio, Texas, last month. The deaths, which resulted in the indictment of two men,  was the worst-known fatal smuggling incident in US history. Migrants often pay human smuggling groups linked to drug cartels thousands of dollars to transport them across the Mexico border and keep them hidden in so-called stash  houses, which are typically found closer to the border in southern US states.
