“Jeopardy!” has found a new streaming home after leaving Netflix last year. Fans will soon be able to watch the iconic game show, as well as “Wheel of Fortune,” as much as they want, whenever they want beginning Aug. 1. Free streamer Pluto TV signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to create a 24/7 channel just for old episodes of both quiz shows. Each series will have its own channel, Vulture reported. According to the outlet, Pluto will use both series to help launch more game show content on the platform. Pluto moved its other game channels, such as Buzzr, Game Show Central and vintage “The Price is Right” episodes, out of the entertainment category and into a new game show vertical. A new channel on the ad-supported company launched Monday and saw the debut of CBS’s “Let’s Make a Deal.” On Aug. 1, “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!” will join the party and Pluto will have eight categories just for game shows. Vulture noted that Sony plans to “license older episodes of the series as well as ones from just a few years ago” to Pluto. Pluto will now become the exclusive streaming place for both shows among apps that use ads. A “Jeopardy!” spinoff will also be arriving this autumn on ABC. “Celebrity Jeopardy!” is set to air Sundays at 8 p.m. The show will give famous faces the chance to score money for a charity of their choice. As for “Wheel of Fortune,” the show will be embarking on its first live tour in North America starting Sept. 8. The tour will stop at 60 cities across the continent and will offer fans a unique experience regarding the popular show.
