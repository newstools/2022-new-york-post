We’re not going to lie to you — we take great pride in making coffee in the morning. In fact, it’s one of the highlights of our wake-up routines. Whether choosing between the Keurig and Nespresso, we reviewed or, for Prime Day 2022 especially, the best Amazon coffee makers, we’re constantly sipping on fresh brews. Lovingly, the fan-favorite Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine is $100 off this Prime Day for one more hour. It has more than 18K reviews from coffee lovers worldwide, and we absolutely think it’s worth the hype. Not only is the beautiful brushed stainless steel machine one of the best Prime Day splurges to add to your cart, but you won’t be disappointed. In fact, it includes an integrated grinder (more on that below) to transform your aromatic beans to espresso in one minute. That’s pretty impressive if we’re being honest. The adored espresso machine is undoubtedly worth your counter’s precious real estate, especially for its restaurant-grade look and efficiency. Moreover, you’ll appreciate its precision control burr grinder that delivers the precise amount of ground coffee directly into the portafilter. You can also select the boldness roast to suit your preference. Oh, and if you love frothed milk (don’t we all!), the Breville boasts a manual micro-foam milk texturing feature that (1) enhances your espresso’s overall flavor and (2) allows you to create the latte art you see all over Instagram. If you’re looking for something to treat yourself to this Prime Day, we can attest this is one of your best bets. Though pricier than other espresso machines, it does the job — and does the job well — and is built to last.
