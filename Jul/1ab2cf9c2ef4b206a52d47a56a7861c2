Gov. Kathy Hochul is going first-class in her run to remain New York governor. A Post analysis shows she flew aboard state-owned planes and helicopters a whopping 140 times between August 2021 and March 2022. Hochul’s taxpayer-funded flights cost upward of $170,000 and more as the frequency of her air travel has increased and the cost of jet fuel has soared. One flight aboard the State Police-operated Sikorsky 76D chopper and the Beechcraft King Air plane costs taxpayers about $2,500 and $1,300 per hour, respectively. And one of her “official” flights included a roundtrip to see the Buffalo Bills home opener last September. In more ways than one, this gov is copying her disgraced predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, who also accumulated questionable frequent-flyer miles on state-owned aircraft. Her exploitation of her office has been shameless. New Yorkers struggle to fill their gas tanks, while our high-flying governor travels above it all at their expense — for trips that have helped her raise tens of millions from favor-seekers and lobbyists. Given her 7-to-1 financial advantage over her Republican rival, Lee Zeldin, Hochul has no excuse for sticking taxpayers with the cost of her air travel when she can charge her enormous campaign war chest (which she’s filling and refilling with implicit promises to spend the public’s money, anyway). The gov’s high-flying games are probably legal, and entirely within the Albany tradition, but that doesn’t make them any less corrupt.
