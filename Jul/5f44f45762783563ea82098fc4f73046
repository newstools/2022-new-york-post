Cardinals analyst Al Hrabosky had quite the on-air mix-up following St. Louis’ 6-3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday, when he confused an iconic movie character with a notorious porn star. The confusion began when Hrabosky and Bally Sports studio host Alexa Datt discussed a unique ensemble worn by Cardinals pitcher Miles Mikolas, which consisted of sunglasses and a cowboy hat. When coupled with his mustache, Mikolas closely resembled Ron Burgundy, the character Will Ferrell portrayed in the 2004 comedy “Anchorman.” Though Datt insinuated that Mikolas mirrored David Koechner’s cowboy hat-wearing Champ Kind from the film, Hrabosky took the conversation in an unexpected direction when he asked, “Who was it that wore the cowboy hat with Ron Jeremy?” referencing the adult film star. Datt attempted to answer the question to no avail as she broke into laughter. Seemingly realizing his mistake, Hrabosky corrected the gaffe soon after by asserting that he meant Burgundy. Hrabosky’s Freudian slip is not the first time a sports analyst has mixed up the two Rons. Fox play-by-play man Gus Johnson flubbed Burgundy and Jeremy in an incident from 2014, per Larry Brown Sports.
