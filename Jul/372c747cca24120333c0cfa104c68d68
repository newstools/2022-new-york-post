Two young brothers turned themselves into Philadelphia police Monday over the vicious beating death of 73-year-old James Lambert that was caught on camera, police said. The siblings, ages 10 and 14, surrendered to authorities in connection to the fatal attack carried out by the crew of youngsters, according to authorities. Lambert was hit with a traffic cone during June 24 attack and died from his injuries a day later, police said. Police confirmed the two minors were among the seven kids allegedly involved in attacking the lifelong Philadelphia resident, though it is unclear what role the brothers had. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner told CBS 3 Philly the investigation is very active and juveniles involved could likely face murder charges “certainly on the very limited information we have.” No formal charges have been brought. Investigators were still working to identify some of the minors in the attack, CBS 3 Philly reported. Police said four males and three females were involved. Shocking video of the incident released by police Friday shows Lambert attempting to get away from the teens as they follow and knock him to the ground with a traffic cone. As he tried to get up, he was knocked down again as his attackers smile and laugh. Philadelphia police is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to their arrest.
