Elon Musk, who is in the process of buying Twitter, broke his silence Friday on the social media platform after going dark for more than a week. The tech billionaire and Tesla CEO tweeted for the first time from his personal account since June 21. The message, sent to his more than 100 million followers, was a tribute to a popular YouTuber who died of cancer. In other posts, he shared a recent photo of himself with four of his children and Pope Francis. “Honored to meet @Pontifex yesterday,” Musk tweeted. He also tweeted throw-back photos of himself in Venice with ex-wife Talulah Riley. Musk’s tweet in honor of the late YouTuber included the following description: “Popular Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade with 12 Billion subscribers recently passed away at the age of 23 due to cancer, and this made [me] realize that cancer is [an] absurd piece of literal garbage and death, but also try to live your best life with people who know. They could die the following day, and you would regret not doing things with them.” The tribute included a quote from Sonic the Hedgehog.
