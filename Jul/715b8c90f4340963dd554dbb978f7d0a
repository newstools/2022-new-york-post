A shocking TikTok video showing the horrifying concept of sympathy cards for school shootings has horrified users, both online and in-store. The video — which was originally uploaded in 2018 — was recently shared again by the mass shooting awareness organization Change the Ref. The video shows hidden camera footage of horrified people walking past the card section in an unidentified story, with many in seeming disbelief over the shocking display. “Mass sympathy cards. Coming soon. If we do nothing,” the end caption read. “Wow,” said one woman said, while another added, “Oh, my God.” A woman who looked at the cards at the beginning of the clip is seen bringing a companion back to the display, where they both look stunned at the card section. The video then shows the whole section, which includes other card categories —  graduation, congratulations, friendship and thank you — with “school shooting” among them. The black-and-white cards have words like “gunned,” “I’m sorry,” “arms” and “sympathy” written on them. The various messages on the cards read “I’m sorry your kid was gunned down,” “Condolences on the shooting of your teacher” and “Sorry for your terrifying loss.” The video has been watched more than 46,000 times since it was uploaded, with thousands of users taking to the comments section to express their thoughts on the advertisement’s purpose and gun laws. “I’m a teacher… and the emotional response I got from this video… I shouldn’t be scared for my students and myself,” one woman wrote. “These need to be in every store across America, now,” another commented. Change the Ref is an organization that “uses urban art and nonviolent creative confrontation to expose the disastrous effects of the mass shooting pandemic,” according to its site. Change the Red was started by Manuel and Patricia Oliver after their son, Joaquin, was killed in the MSD High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018.
