The lovebirds were most certainly “in heat.” A kinky couple defied public health officials’ warnings to avoid vigorous outdoor activities — by having sex on the roof of a public parking lot — as the UK sweltered through its hottest day in history. The shocking incident occurred in Birmingham, England, around midday last Tuesday as temps soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The brazen Brits were busted by a worker watching from the window of a nearby office building. The spectator recorded the romp on their phone before posting the frisky footage to Twitter. The X-rated clip quickly went viral, clocking up more than 100,000 views, with pundits shocked by the shameless couple’s complete disregard for decency. The eight-second video shows the pair engaged in doggy-style sex on the parking lot roof. They appeared to be completely naked, save for the fact the man was wearing a party hat atop his head. While the roof was empty, the couple clearly didn’t care about getting caught, with the video showing they were in full view of multiple office buildings surrounding the lot. On Twitter, many spectators were stunned by the fact that the plucky pair were having a sweat soaked sex session in the blistering heat, as most in the region sought shade and air conditioning to keep cool. “Hope they have sun cream on,” one quipped. “They literally took ‘It’s getting hot in here’ to the next level,” another chimed in. The pervy pair aren’t the first to go viral on social media for romping in public. Earlier this month, an appalled Hong Kong hotel guest captured two couples engaging in naughty sex acts in the facility’s jacuzzis. Meanwhile, in May, a British couple were busted having sex on a seaside cliff, with spectators at a nearby restaurant able to see the entire erotic episode occurring from the window of the eatery.
