This aesthetician is facing “dyer” Internet consequences over her latest video on TikTok. Miranda Wilson, or @np.miranda on TikTok, posted a since-deleted video suggesting what type of work she would perform on “Stranger Things” actress Natalia Dyer’s face. The resurfaced video is trending on Twitter amid a backlash to Wilson’s proposed “treatments” for the 27-year-old star. In the clip, the certified aesthetic nurse practitioner injector said the first thing she would start with are Dyer’s masseter muscles. These are part of the jaw used to help with chewing. “We all know how much I love treating masseters to help slim the face,” she said. Her next move would be to use chin filler to “help fill out her chin and make her face more of a heart shape,” Wilson said. Other steps included lip filler to give Dyer a pout. “We’d get in there and do a little botox. I’d give her a nice brow lift to help open up her eyes. And to top it off, we’d start working with some Sculptra,” Wilson said. Toward the end of the TikTok, she showed a photoshopped “after” version of all the treatments she planned to do. Despite the video being taken down, it can still be found on Twitter where almost all the comments point to how toxic a clip like this can be for young actresses. “Still can’t believe a plastic surgeon spoke on what she’d change about someone’s face without a) their consent, b) any indication that the person disliked those features + c) putting a disclaimer that the person is already beautiful as they are?” one person tweeted. “…I hate people. Natalia Dyer is absolutely stunning as she is. Not everyone wants to look like a great value Kardashian,” tweeted another. Wilson did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.
