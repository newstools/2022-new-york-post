Isaiah Hartenstein has been playing professional basketball since the age of 16. Eschewing college, Hartenstein bounced around with four different franchises — and for parts of three seasons in the G League — before landing in New York this summer with what appears to be the first settled role of his career. That long, winding journey is all part of the 7-foot Hartenstein’s story, each stop a key factor leading to the breakthrough two-year, $16 million contract with the Knicks. “He earned it,” his father, Flo, told The Post in a phone interview. “I’m just very proud of him. I’ve seen what he’s gone through.” Patience was required. So were good fortune and an ability to take advantage of it, as he did this past season with the Clippers.
