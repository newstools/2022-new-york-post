Can you spot the naked woman with your naked eye? Viewers are being challenged to find a nude model hidden in a saucy artwork by Italian body-painter Johannes Stötter. [Warning: Spoilers below] At first glance, Stötter’s “The Butterfly” seems to show nothing but an insect perched on a bright yellow flower. However, upon closer inspection, many viewers realize that the butterfly in the image is actually a woman covered in body paint. She is curled into position so as to become concealed inside the artwork. “Everyone has reacted very positively and many people agree that this is my best artwork so far,” Stötter told Caters News of the artwork, which doubles as a raunchy optical illusion. “I think it is a very beautiful picture, even if you don’t know that it is a body painting,” the artist proudly added. While “The Butterfly” may initially look like a relatively simple painting, it took Stötter an age to create. The nude model — known only as Laura — needed to sit for the process five times with Stötter working out exactly how to paint her so that she perfectly blended into the bright flower. Laura was then required to sit in place for hours on end so that a photographer could capture images of the completed work. “She remained calm and patient and did a wonderful job,” Stötter stated. “It is, of course, difficult to hold a position for a long time. Certain body parts get really challenged.” The painting isn’t the first optical illusion to feature a racy hidden image. Earlier this week, a 1987 drawing by Swiss artist Sandro Del-Prete was back in the headlines after critics claimed it could reveal whether viewers had a dirty mind. The drawing shows an image sketched on a jar — with some observers witnessing a seemingly kinky depiction, while other more innocent-minded viewers purporting to instead see something else.
