The Jets have their rookie class locked up just on time. Running back Breece Hall, the team’s second-round pick, signed his rookie contract in time to report to training camp on Tuesday with the rest of the Jets rookies. The deal is for four years, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. Hall, who played for Iowa State in college, ran for 1,472 yards last season with 20 touchdowns. The 21-year-old also had 36 receptions and three receiving touchdowns for the Cyclones. He figures to get a chance at the starting job for the Jets, entering a competition with Michael Carter and Tevin Coleman that should be one to watch throughout camp. The Jets ranked 27th in rushing offense last season by total yardage.
