Sorry, Tom Brady, it looks like the third time won’t be the charm for the newly retired Rob Gronkowski. The former NFL tight end, who called it a career for the second time last month, told ESPN this week that he’s “done with football” — even if his former quarterback came calling. “I would answer, obviously, I would obviously answer the greatest quarterback of all time, ask him how he’s doing, and tell him I’m doing good, but I wouldn’t go back to football, no,” Gronkowski said. In response to Gronkowski’s initial retirement announcement, his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said the 33-year-old could potentially return if Brady “calls him during the season.” Brady, 44, then responded with a meme of former congressional candidate Martin Baker making a phone call. Gronkowski spent the first nine years of his career in New England before retiring in March 2019. He came out of retirement a year later to join Brady in Tampa. Gronkowski and Brady won a Super Bowl title in their first season with the Buccaneers, defeating the Chiefs in February 2021. They reached the postseason in January but were ousted in the divisional round by the Rams. Brady then revealed in February that he was going to step away from football, only to return 40 days later. He is now gearing up for his third season with the Buccaneers and his 23rd year overall. As for Gronkowski, he’s now focusing on his business ventures, notably with Ice Shaker and Gronk Fitness. Gronkowski, a five-time Pro Bowler and four-time Super Bowl champ, wrapped his prolific career with 92 touchdowns, 621 receptions, and 9,286 receiving yards.
