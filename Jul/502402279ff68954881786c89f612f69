Grover isn’t the the only one working blue on “Sesame Street.” A leaked clip of Julia Louis-Dreyfus cursing like a sailor on “Sesame Street” is blowing up online. Social media is in stitches over the uproarious resurfaced outtake, in which the “Seinfeld” and “Veep” star dropped an epic S-bomb during a cameo on the classic kid’s show. The curse-laden clip apparently originated in 1994, but is suddenly going viral on Reddit and Twitter, racking up millions of fresh views as of Sunday. The 30-second blooper starts off with the now 61-year-old TV icon sharing a scene with Muppets Elmo and Zoe. The take goes belly-up after Louis-Dreyfus says the wrong name, and then subsequently utters an audible “s – – t” after realizing her mistake. The sitcom star attempts to apologize for firing off the profanity, whereupon Elmo, staying in character, acknowledges that she “said a bad word” — and asks her for “$5” for the swear jar. “You’re going to be a rich Muppet at the end of this day,” retorts Louis-Dreyfus, while prepping to redo the take. Needless to say, Redditors had a field day with the “New Adventures of Old Christine” actress’s PG-13-rated outtake. “That’s gold, Jerry! Gold!” wrote one fan, referencing Steve Hytner’s immortal line from “Seinfeld.” “Elmo shook down guest stars?” wondered another. Others marveled at the Muppets’ method acting between takes. “I love that the Muppets stay in character BETWEEN shots!” exclaimed one “Sesame Street” die-hard. “Of course, it makes perfect sense but it’s neat to see. Must really help the guest feel part of the Sesame Street world.” Another added, “I love when Elmo goes unscripted.” In 2018, another “Sesame Street” clip made waves online after Redditors claimed that Grover said the F-word during a scene.
