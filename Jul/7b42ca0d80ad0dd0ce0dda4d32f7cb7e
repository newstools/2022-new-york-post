The NYPD is being called in to protect Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during a campaign rally in Queens on Sunday evening after he was attacked upstate last week. A small contingent of cops has been assigned to safeguard the outgoing congressman from Long Island during his scheduled 7 p.m. appearance at Francis Lewis Park, a law-enforcement source said. Undercover operatives from the NYPD’s Intelligence Division also will be on hand, along with uniformed officers from the local precinct, another source said. There were no cops present Thursday evening when troubled Army veteran David Jakubonis allegedly swung a plastic knuckle weapon shaped like a cat’s head at Zeldin’s throat as the pol gave a speech in upstate Fairport near Rochester. Several bystanders — including Zeldin’s running mate, Alison Esposito, a retired NYPD cop — subdued and disarmed Jakubonis, then held him for several minutes until Monroe County sheriff’s deputies arrived at the scene. Jakubonis, 43, was initially charged with attempted second-degree assault and automatically cut loose after his arraignment in Perinton Town Court under terms of the state’s controversial 2019 bail-reform law. But he was then arrested Saturday by the FBI and charged with assaulting a member of Congress with a dangerous weapon and ordered held pending a bail hearing in Rochester federal court Wednesday. Zeldin is challenging Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was lieutenant governor when former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned over a sexual harassment scandal last year.
