Gotta spot them all? Another day another wildlife safari for the eyes: This time around, animal lovers are challenged to find at least 10 critters in this viral optical illusion currently circulating the web. [Warning: Spoilers Below] According to JagranJosh.com, only 10% of people can spot all 10 creatures in this visual menagerie within 15 seconds. The visual jigsaw is especially tricky: Upon first glance, the sketch appears to depict nothing but a mountain, trees, a river and some rocks. However, within this seemingly barren landscape lies a whopping 10 animals hiding in plain sight: a parrot, a bull, elephant, deer, crocodile, horse, goose, fox, rooster and even a person. Some users even claim they’ve spotted a frog. Thankfully, the site provides helpful hints on where to find them, including the fact that the elephant, deer and crocodile are all in close proximity to each other. If looking for more clues, the crocodile lies above a horse and goose. The parrot and bull sit perched in the tree while the smoking man is to the left of it and the rooster is located in an unlikely location. Still can’t find them all? Not to fear, JagranJosh provides a color-coded answer key so viewers can see all the camouflaged critters — save for the frog — in full detail. If that wasn’t tricky enough, take a gander at this reptilian retinal puzzle, in which the goal is to find the snake amongst the turtles within 15 seconds.
