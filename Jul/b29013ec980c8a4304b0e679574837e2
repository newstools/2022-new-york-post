Are you totally satisfied with your daily habits, or do you think there’s somewhere you could improve? Developing a healthy routine is a challenge, especially when you’re trying to do it on top of work and managing your home, a social life, or parenting, but you don’t have to go it alone. Ultiself Biohacker Routine Planner App kind of works like having a personal training in your pocket, and it could help you build healthy habits. For a limited time, a lifetime subscription to Ultiself Biohacker Routine Planner is on sale for only $19 (Reg. $159). Unlike a real personal trainer, Ultiself isn’t going to yell at you or give you a harsh critique for what your day-to-day looks like. Instead, it can help you build good habits by giving you free roam of a huge “habit directory” full of 300+ good habits organized by the area of your life they could improve. If you’re looking for a full overhaul, you can even adopt a full prebuilt routine after answering a few questions about your life and goals.  One app store reviewer writes, “Although they’ve truly thought of just about every component of oneself that could possibly need improvement, it’s not overwhelming. Super easy to navigate and track. I’ve used similar apps in the past and they just seem so basic compared to UltiSelf.” Ultiself is simple, easy to use, and you may be shocked at how well it works. With Ultiself, you don’t have to do all the work in picking out what works for you. As you use the app, an AI can identify your effective habits, make suggestions, and rate your effectiveness. That might sound a little intense at first, but Ultiself makes a game of it. Not only can you track your growth and fitness, you can also find yourself on leaderboards, join groups and competitions, and so much more. It’s almost like joining a gym, a sports team, and a club at the same time! Developing and maintaining good habits for yourself is hard, especially when you have so many other things going on in your life.
