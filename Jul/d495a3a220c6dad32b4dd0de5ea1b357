A man was killed in the Bronx Tuesday afternoon when he tried to ride his motorcycle between two SUVs, cops said. Two other riders who tried to make the maneuver with him at Morrison Avenue and Harrod Place around 2:30 p.m. were injured, police said. Their conditions weren’t immediately known. “They tried to get in between two SUVs,” a police spokesman said. The deceased man’s green and yellow Nike sneaker remained lodged against the bike’s back tire, photos from the scene show.
