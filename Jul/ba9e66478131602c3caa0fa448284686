A Tampa Bay area man was arrested Saturday for allegedly throwing a hot dog at an officer who warned him he was violating a city ordinance, according to a local report. Jason Stoll, 47, is charged with felony battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer without violence. Around 12 a.m. Saturday, a St. Petersburg police officer told Stoll he could no longer sell hot dogs in the roadway after his street closure permit ended, according to court documents obtained by WFLA. An officer asked Stoll to close up shop, but he continued to try selling a hot dog, the court documents say. Stoll became frustrated and threw a hot dog at the officer, who was in full uniform at the time of the incident, according to the station. Stoll, who lives in New Port Richey, was booked into the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. Online court records show he is out after posting $2,500 bail. The court records note he has many tattoos, including the phrases “hustle eat sleep repeat,” and “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger,” among many others. He faces a minimum of three years in jail if convicted.
