The Rangers have Igor Shesterkin’s new backup. The team is signing veteran goalie Jaroslav Halak to a one-year, $1.55 million contract, The Post’s Larry Brooks reports. The club also announced it signed former Penguins goalie Louis Domingue to a two-year deal. The Rangers needed a new backup after trading Alexander Georgiev, who was due a qualifying offer by this past Monday, to the Avalanche last week. Halak, the 37-year-old former Islander, had a .903 save percentage and 2.94 goals-against average in 17 games with the Canucks last season. Earlier Wednesday, the Rangers struck a seven-year deal with Vincent Trocheck worth more than $39 million.
