UFC’s resident cowboy is hanging it up. After 55 fights in MMA and the second-most wins in UFC history (23), UFC legend Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone has decided to retire. Cerrone, 39, has fought some of the best that the UFC has had to offer like, Conor McGregor, Rafael Dos Anjos, Justin Gaethje, Leon Edwards, and Jorge Masvidal. The Denver native has really fallen on hard times as a fighter. He ends his career on a seven-fight winless streak with six losses and a no-contest. Five of those losses came by knockout or submission. He finishes his career 36-17 with two no-contests. Cerrone put his cowboy hat and gloves down in the middle of the octagon right before his post-fight interview with Joe Rogan. “I don’t love it anymore, Joe,” Cerrone said. “It’s hard for me to get up. … I just don’t love it anymore. I am going to be a movie star, baby” Cerrone has been dabbling in acting recently. Per his IMDB page, he will be starring in a new horror film, “Apartment 213,” expected later this year, and has also had small roles in “The Equalizer 2” and Amazon Prime’s “Copshop.” Cerrone ends his career having never held a UFC title. From 2014-16, he fought a whopping 12 times, going 11-1 in that span with the one loss being for the UFC lightweight championship against Rafael Dos Anjos. Cerrone retires with 16 career UFC finishes, tied for the second-most in UFC history. Cerrone left the octagon with his two kids, 4-year-old Dacson Danger, and 1-year-old Riot River.
