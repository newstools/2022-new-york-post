Two men were robbed of their pricey Rolex watches by the same crook in Midtown last month — and cops said Friday that they are still looking to track down the suspect. The first victim was on Eighth Avenue near West 46th Street just before 3 a.m. June 13 when a man approached him and offered to sell him drugs, cops said. When the victim refused, the suspect snatched his luxury watch — worth $25,000 — from his left wrist, causing a minor injury to his ring finger, authorities said. The thief is shown on surveillance footage struggling to grab the watch before taking off. The victim was treated by EMS on scene. Then on June 20 around 2:50 a.m., cops believe the same suspect, joined by another man, approached a 44-year-old man at Eighth Avenue and West 37th Street and started assaulting him, authorities said. Then they swiped his Rolex watch — worth $30,000 — and his wallet, holding credit cards, causing scrapes on his right hand, police said. They fled on foot, heading east on Fifth Avenue, cops said. The victim refused medical attention on scene. Both suspects are believed to be in their 30s, with dark complexions, about 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds, cops said. There is no indication that the thefts are connected to a high-end robbery ring, such as OED — or Own Every Dollar — that has terrorized patrons of Big Apple hotspots for their pricey jewelry. Both incidents come days after a 27-year-old man — possibly looking to buy drugs — was lured into Toast Cafe on Sixth Avenue near West 36th Street, according to police. Once in the upstairs area, two suspects placed a knife against his victim’s back and grabbed his $10,000 watch off his wrist, cops said. The NYPD released photos of those suspects on Wednesday.
