With Amazon Prime Day right around the corner, it’s the perfect time to be making those wishlists, shopping early deals that are already live and studying everything we know so far about the big day. The two-day shopping extravaganza, which is taking place on Tuesday, July 12 and Wednesday, July 13, is the perfect occasion to save big on some big-ticket items (and grab-and-go, practical options, too), like new outdoor patio furniture, cloud-like mattresses and high-powered vacuums. Amazingly, Amazon is offering all shoppers a free $20 credit (we love free money!) that’ll be added to your online shopping cart before Prime Day. We have the 411 on what to do to access it, too. When you’re a first-time user of backing up your pictures and other components of your camera roll to Amazon Photos, you’ll earn a $20 credit. Not to mention, Prime members will receive unlimited full-resolution photo storage upon downloading the app. This offer is only eligible for first-time Amazon photo users. Additionally, this exclusive $20 credit is only eligible for Prime Day purchases — that is, only orders made on July 12 and 13. You will receive an email from Amazon within four days confirming when the promotional credit has been applied to your customer account, along with instructions on how to redeem it. If you’re a Prime member, that’s also how you’ll redeem the unique offer. Unfortunately, members on a free 30-day trial of a Prime membership aren’t eligible for this promotional credit. As Prime Day approaches, we couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come. We can’t wait to shop all of Amazon’s best-selling items, some incredible deals on Amazon’s devices and more. Plus, if you’re all about the photos, check out our guide to the best DSLR cameras and ring lights to pick up (with two-day shipping, of course).
