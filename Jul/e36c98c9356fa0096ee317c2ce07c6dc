Disney+ is expanding its Marvel slate. The R-rated action films of the comic book company, including “Deadpool,” “Deadpool 2” and “Logan,” will be added to the streaming service on July 22. Disney noted in a statement regarding the transition on Thursday: “Subscribers are invited to revisit their parental controls settings to ensure a viewing experience most suitable for them and their family.” The superhero films were produced under 20th Century Fox and are now part of the Disney family after the latter company acquired much of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment division. Disney+ is known for adding family-oriented and kid-friendly content, capping its ratings at PG-13. The streamer also recently added Netflix’s mature Marvel adult series “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones,” “Luke Cage,” “The Punisher,” “Iron Fist” and “The Defenders.” Both the Ryan Reynolds-led “Deadpool” series and the Hugh Jackman-helmed Wolverine film “Logan” are part of the X-Men comic book serials. Reynolds, 45, quipped about the streaming service’s addition of the mature flicks on Twitter: “We’re supposed to announce ‘Logan’ and ‘Deadpool’ will soon be the first R-rated movies on Disney+. But we all know some Disney movies should already be rated R for irreversible trauma.” Jackman, 53, jokingly replied to the Canadian native’s post, scribing: “No amount of mutant healing factor could heal these emotional scars. Great movies for family night in!” Disney+ is also home to projects that are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, hosting series such as “Loki,” “Moon Knight,” “The Falcon and the Winter Solider” and “WandaVision.” The Disney+ premieres of the three films are set to be promoted by the streamer during this weekend’s San Diego Comic-Con with free chimichangas.
