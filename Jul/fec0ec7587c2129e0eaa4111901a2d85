It was like a scene out of the movie “Anaconda.” A Brazilian fishing guide got a closer wildlife encounter than intended after a giant anaconda leaped out of the water and bit him. A shocking clip of the harrowing herpetological encounter is making a splash online. “When I was filming the anaconda, she pulled away and I saw that she was about to strike,”  Joao Severino, 38, told Jam Press of the alarming moment. The angling expert had reportedly spotted the serpent while guiding a boat full of tourists on the Araguaia River in the central Brazilian state of Goiás. “I saw the snake on a stump and I said, ‘Look, guys, an anaconda is over there, I’m going to film it for you to see,'” Severino recalled. That’s when he inadvertently ended the trip with a fang. In the accompanying 35-second POV clip, filmed via the guide’s phone, the camera zooms in on a black-spotted snake coiled below the water near two partially submerged stumps. In a flash, the serpent lunges out of the water and strikes the tour guide, who cries out in shock. The behemoth boa then disappears back into the drink as the guide and his guests erupt into relieved laughter. Thankfully, the scaly predator failed to penetrate Severino’s skin and he was able to laugh off the attack. The fishing guide should thank his lucky stars he wasn’t injured by the green anaconda, which is the world’s largest snake, capable of growing up to 30 feet long and 550 pounds with a diameter of 10 inches. “They aren’t venomous but they are extremely strong, one of the most agile snakes that exists underwater,” biologist Edson Abrao told Viral Press. “They are animals that feed and kill their prey underwater.” While not known to attack humans, the South American constrictor will attack “when they feel threatened,” explained the snake expert. In a far more terrifying snake attack in 2020, a Thai teen had to be hospitalized after a python bit his penis while he was on the toilet.
