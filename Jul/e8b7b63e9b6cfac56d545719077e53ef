A sicko scrawled three swastikas on a Manhattan sidewalk, the NYPD said. The hate symbols appeared in the rear of 420  East 61st Street on the Upper East Side at about 10:15 a.m. June 23, cops said. Police on Saturday released several surveillance photos of the suspect, a 50-year-old 5-foot-9 man, weighing 160 pounds, with a medium complexion, medium build and sporting a salt and pepper beard. He was last seen wearing a baseball cap with the words ‘New York’ written on the front, and a dark colored long sleeve shirt with vertical stripes, authorities said. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating.
