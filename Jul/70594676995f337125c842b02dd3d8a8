Welcome to our version of the Super Bowl: Amazon Prime Day 2022. For July 12 and 13, the retailer is dishing out incredible savings on waitlist-inducing items from some of its bestselling products, backyard-ready outdoor patio furniture and more. We’re posting a telethon of deals every few minutes to ensure you’re spending your money wisely, receiving alerts for almost-gone items and reading our favorite deals. With just one scroll through Amazon‘s site, the thousands of offered products can become overwhelming. That’s why we curated this live blog, which will be updated every five to ten minutes with new Lightning Deals (that you have to order ASAP) and fresh, of-the-moment  finds. In short, we want you to score the best deals possible. Please check retailer websites for any price and inventory changes that may have changed since our individual blog posts.
