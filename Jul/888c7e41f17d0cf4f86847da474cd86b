Fans of the hit “John Wick” film franchise got more than what they bargained for at this year’s Comic-Con in San Diego on Friday. The annual comic book convention is taking place this weekend, with its final day set for Sunday. And on Friday, none other than Keanu Reeves surprised the dedicated crowd in attendance. While they may have thought the beloved actor was simply paying a visit, the “John Wick” hero actually came will a treat for fans of the movie. Surprising the crowd with brand new footage from the upcoming fourth installment of the film, Reeves joined director Chad Stahelski’s panel to share the clip. The minute-long clip shows Reeves’ character fighting his enemies, and opens with him punching a roped pole. A voiceover then asks him, “Have you given any thought to where this ends? No one, not even you, can kill everyone.” Reeves’ character then can be seen in action-packed shots filmed in five countries, including Japan, Jordan, Germany, France, and of course, the US. “Sorry to crash the party, they threw me out here,” Reeves told Comic-Con fans. The teaser also showed some very famous co-stars, including Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Laurence Fishburne. The film’s universe is also expanding beyond the big screen. A prequel miniseries, “The Continental,” is coming to Starz. Mel Gibson was cast in the lead role as the character Cormac. “John Wick” became a huge action franchise for Lionsgate, not just in its global franchise B.O. through three movies of $584.2 million. “John Wick 4” is scheduled for release on March 24, 2023.
