A day after Keith Hernandez had his No. 17 retired, the Mets came up empty and were blanked by the Fish. Nice game, pretty boys! Their lead in the National League East is down to 1 ¹/₂ games, and they head to Hotlanta where the Bravos are looking to chop their way to the top. Two Maxes, Scherzer (5-1, 2.26) and Fried (9-2, 2.52), both maximize their teams chances of winning. Scherzer went on the injured list with a left oblique strain, bought the Binghamton Rumble Ponies a $7,000 dinner before returning on Tuesday to two-hit Cincinnati over six reassuring innings. Fried was fried, losing his first two games back in April. Hasn’t lost since and has allowed only one run over his last 13 innings. Maximum matchup. Going with Scherzer and the Mets for 10 units. You need a lot of runs to beat the Yankees. The Red Sox scored 11 and won, 11-6. Boston with three homers off Jameson Taillon. Winner. Up +1,659 yastrzemskis.
