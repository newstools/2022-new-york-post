A 14-year-old boy is clinging to life and a 15-year-old was injured in a targeted broad-daylight shooting in East Harlem Tuesday, police said. The younger teen was shot in the head and the other boy was hit in the left leg by a gunman who opened fire at them near the corner of East 128th Street and Park Avenue at about 4:22 p.m., according to cops. “This is terrible and we shouldn’t have to suffer through this gun violence,” Chief of Patrol Jeffrey Maddrey said in an emotional press conference from the scene. “We shouldn’t be scared to walk out in our streets in the broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon and feel like we’re going to be victims of gun violence.” The two teens were shot after leaving a deli on East 128th Street. As they were traveling toward Park Avenue, the gunman emerged and began firing at the boys, according to Maddrey. The 14-year-old, who was on a push scooter, was struck as he fled into the street. He collapsed between two cars and was hospitalized in “very, very serious condition,” said Maddrey. The older teen was able to make it across the street and run toward Lexington Avenue where he eventually was helped by a passerby who called 911, Maddrey said. He was taken to the hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. Maddrey said the suspect fled west on 128th Street toward Madison Avenue. Police were canvassing for video and ballistic evidence. It’s unclear how many shots were fired or what the motive was. At the press conference, Maddrey implored the public to assist authorities if they have any information about the shooting.
