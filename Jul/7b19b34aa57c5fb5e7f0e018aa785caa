A popular conservative radio host has quit her high-profile Miami gig ahead of the anticipated purchase of her station by a George Soros-backed liberal group, according to a report. Cuban-American Lourdes Ubieta, who hosted a show on Miami’s Radio Mambi, said she rejected a lucrative deal to stay on at the station. “I would never cut a deal with these people,” she told Fox News. “Never, never, never.” Radio Mambi has long been associated with Miami’s sizable Cuban exile population and has maintained a right-leaning anti-Communist bent. But Ubieta, who will move to another station, said she expects the outlet to change drastically under new ownership. The $60 million deal to purchase 18 Spanish-language stations across the country is pending FCC approval. Stephanie Valencia, a former Obama administration staffer, and Jess Morales Rocketto, who worked with Hillary Clinton’s’ presidential campaign, told Axios recently that their new Spanish-language radio conglomerate will reach a third of all Hispanics living in America. The venture’s primary financial backer is Lakestar Finance, “an investment entity affiliated with Soros Fund Management,” Axios reported. Actress Eva Longoria is also signing on to the project. Ubieta said she was offered a deal to remain with Radio Mambi but declined the payday. “They told me that I will receive half the money as soon as they get the FCC approval and then the rest of the money when Soros people take over,” she said. “I don’t want to be part of the deal. I’m not going to sign the papers and I quit.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ team released a series of ads criticizing the takeover, arguing that the new ownership group would seek to spread disinformation. Representatives for the new venture, Latino Media Network, have countered that they intend to “empower” Hispanic listeners and broaden their influence.
