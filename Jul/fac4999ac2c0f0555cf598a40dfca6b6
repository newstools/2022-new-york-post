Actress Rebecca Balding — best known for her TV roles on “Soap” and “Charmed” — died on Monday, her husband, actor-director James L. Conway, told Deadline. She was 73. Conway said Balding lost her battle with ovarian cancer in Park City, Utah. Born in 1948 in Little Rock, Arkansas, Balding got her start on stage in Chicago before heading to Hollywood, where she booked multiple TV spots, starting with a two-episode stint as a Russian spy in “The Bionic Woman.” But she is probably best known for her portrayal of attorney Carol David in 19 episodes of “Soap” from 1977 to 1981. Her character seduced a gay man named Jodie — played by Billy Crystal — and became pregnant after the two had a one-night stand. In 1998, Balding appeared in a season one episode of “Charmed.” She later returned to the series in a different role — as Alyssa Milano’s boss from 2002 until the show’s end in 2006. Her other credits include “Makin’ It,” “Lou Grant,” “The Gathering,” “Mr. and Mrs. and Mr.” and “7th Heaven,” well as the 1977 movie “Deadly Game” alongside Andy Griffith and James Cromwell. She also appeared in the horror films “Silent Scream” in 1979 and “The Boogens” in 1981 — during her audition for the latter she met Conway. Her most recent film role was the 2005 drama “Yesterday’s Dreams.” Balding is survived by Conway, her daughters — Sarah and Kathleen — and grandkids.
