The Yankees defeated the Cincinnati Reds in a wild 10th inning comeback victory Wednesday night, but some of their fans weren’t exactly in the mood to celebrate with one another. During the Bronx Bombers’ late-inning theatrics, several Yankees fans exchanged a flurry of blows in the stands. The altercation stemmed from a heated verbal exchange between two fans, one donning a pinstripe jersey and backwards cap and the other wearing an Aaron Judge camouflage jersey. Things quickly escalated, however, once the assailant in the home jersey delivered an open-hand slap to the face of his unsuspecting target. As the two came uncomfortably close face to face and continued to trade words, the fan in an Aaron Judge jersey had his hat knocked off and his face punched by another instigator. What followed was a chaotic free-for-all with flying beers, punches and bodies. Security eventually broke up the brawl and the crowd’s attention returned to the game. At least the Yankees’ MLB-best 27th comeback win of the year sent them home happy.
