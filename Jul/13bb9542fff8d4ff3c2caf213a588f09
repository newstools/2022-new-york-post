The Yankees lead MLB with an astronomical 168 home runs this season, but manager Aaron Boone doesn’t agree with the concept that they rely too much on the long ball. “It’s fake news that we’ve got too many power hitters in the lineup, too many sluggers,” Boone told reporters Wednesday after the Yankees acquired Andrew Benintendi from the Royals. “We’ve got savages in the lineup, really good hitters. Benintendi is a great hitter, gets on base at a really high clip, hits from the left side that gives you some balance. … I’ll be excited to write his name.” The too-many-damn-home-runs narrative may not sit well with Boone, but the Yankees do have their fair share of sluggers. Aaron Judge leads the league with 38 home runs and injured star Giancarlo Stanton ranks sixth with 24, while four other Yankees have double-digit dingers. And even amid a downswing, the Yankees still have the best record in baseball entering play Thursday at 66-33. Benintendi, who earned his first career All-Star nod this season, should balance out the lineup as he’s become more of a contact hitter this year. He’s slashing .320/.387/.398 with three home runs in 93 games. The 28-year-old outfielder had at least 13 home runs in each of his previous four seasons, excluding the COVID-19 shortened 2020 season, when he played in just 14 games because of a rib injury. The left-handed hitter is expected to get at least some of that pop back at Yankee Stadium with the short porch in right field. Benintendi is no stranger to The Bronx after spending his first five seasons with the Red Sox. In 30 games as an opponent at Yankee Stadium, he’s slashed .261/.336/.487 with seven home runs, 20 RBIs and 12 runs. Boone could possibly put Benintendi into the lineup as soon as Thursday, as the Yankees begin a four-game set against a familiar foe in the Royals in The Bronx. The Twins set the major league record for most home runs by a team in a single season in 2019 with 307, beating out the Yankees by one dinger.
