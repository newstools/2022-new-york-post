A gunman opened fire inside of a North Carolina comedy club where comedian Craig Robinson was set to perform on Saturday night, sending people scrambling to evacuate, police said. A man entered The Comedy Zone in Charlotte just after 9 p.m. and flashed his gun, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said. Robinson, best known for playing Darryl in “The Office,” posted a video to Instagram while standing in the crowd during a Big Time Rush concert at the Metro Credit Union Amphitheater. “I’m performing at the Comedy Zone in Charlotte, North Carolina. There was an active shooter in the comedy club. So they moved us over to this — there’s a concert going on so I thought I’d just share with y’all,” said “The Office” star. The venue, located right next to the club, is where he was told to evacuate, he said. “I’m safe. I’m cool. It was wild I was in the green room and they’re like ‘everybody get out!’ It was a moment for sure.” Employees told WSOC that the gunman entered the club while waving a firearm around, demanding that everyone leave the building. The building was evacuated at some point after the man opened fire, according to police. Nobody was injured and the suspect was taken into custody, cops said.
