This pampered pooch just got a face-lift so he could look better — literally. Reggie, an 18-month-old Shar Pei, had recently been rescued by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), after spending his puppyhood in unstable and unsafe conditions. By the time the pup was found, his head was completely bald and suffered severe skin sores on his back. Furthermore, the folds of Reggie’s wrinkly face had caused an infection in his eyes. Indeed, Reggie’s vision had become so poor that he needed round-the-clock eye care. That’s when veterinarians at the Sussex, Brighton and East Grinstead branch of the RSPCA, in Patcham, UK, decided that a face-lift was the best way to restore his eyesight. About two weeks ago, Reggie had surgery to remove excess skin from his face, South West News Service reported on Friday. It’s not unusual for dogs like Reggie to have issues with the chubby folds of their face, said the RSPCA’s deputy head of dogs. “Sadly Reggie’s breed is prone to having problems due to their extra skin but with the treatment he’s had, we hope that this will help prevent further skin problems in the future.” The lucky dog has since recovered and no longer needs medication for his vision. Now, he’s free to live the rest of his life as a family dog — to whomever is fortunate enough to take Reggie into their home. “Reggie is such a sweetheart, so so friendly and loves everyone,” Pearce told SWNS. “We’d like him to live in an adult only home as he isn’t used to children and it would be great if he could live with more experienced owners,” she continued. “He’s a young dog so we hope the right person comes forward so he can get stuck into enjoying his new life.” Reggie’s life-saving surgery was made possible by generous patrons of the RSPCA.
