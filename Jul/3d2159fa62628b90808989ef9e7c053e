In advance of tonight’s Home Run Derby at Dodger Stadium, Jules Posner of The Action Network is here to share his best bets (video above). Pete Alonso (+175), who has won two straight Derbies, arrives as the consensus favorite for the event at BetMGM. And while Posner believes Alonso is a rightful favorite — he brings a 42.7 percent fly-ball percentage to the contest — he’s looking elsewhere for his bets. All Home Run Derby odds are provided by BetMGM Sportsbook and were accurate at time of writing. Posner will begin his card with the Phillies’ Kyle Schwarber (+325), who has posted superior metrics to Alonso in a few key categories. For example, Schwarber’s fly-ball rate this season is 52.6 percent, with his home-run to fly-ball ratio coming in at 25.9 percent, a number that is better than Alonso. Essentially, if Schwarber can bring those same trends to Dodger Stadium, Posner expects the event will come down to him and Alonso. For his second play, Posner is choosing to look further down the board. Specifically, he’s focused in on Corey Seager (+1000). Although the Texas Rangers shortstop arrives with the third-worst odds for the Derby, Posner believes there are positive metrics to consider. For example, Seager leads all Home Run Derby contestants in hard-hit percentage this season and arrives at Monday’s showcase with a 39.6 fly-ball percentage.  Add in that Seager has a 23 percent line-drive percentage and Posner believes he’s worth a shot based on his betting odds.
