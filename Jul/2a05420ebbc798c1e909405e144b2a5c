Former President Donald Trump postponed a rally in Arizona scheduled for Saturday “out of love and respect” for his ex-wife Ivana Trump, who died at her Manhattan townhouse Thursday. In a Friday post on his Truth Social platform, the ex-commander-in-chief said his Save America rally in Prescott Valley would be rescheduled for July 22. The former president, 76, has been holding campaign style rallies to promote Republican candidates ahead of the midterm election as he weighs throwing his hat in the ring for a third consecutive White House run. Ivana Trump, 73, died of “blunt impact injuries” to her torso after accidentally falling down the stairs of her Upper East Side townhouse, a medical examiner ruled Friday. She had suffered from hip pain and required assistance walking around her neighborhood, friends told The Post. Donald Trump, who was married to Ivana for 15 years, announced her death on Thursday. “She was a wonderful, beautiful, and amazing woman, who led a great and inspirational life,” he posted. “Her pride and joy were her three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. She was so proud of them, as we were all so proud of her. Rest In Peace, Ivana!”
