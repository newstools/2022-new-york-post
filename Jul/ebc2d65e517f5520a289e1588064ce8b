Carlos Santana collapsed on stage at a Michigan performance Tuesday night in a scary scene that ended with him waving to fans as he was wheeled away on a stretcher. Santana, 74, was surrounded by crew members and medical personnel after passing out on stage at the Pine Knob Music Theatre in Clarkston, according to pictures shared by WJBK-TV. Someone on stage reportedly asked the crowd to pray for the legendary Latin rock guitarist due to a “serious medical” issue. The “Smooth” artist was then taken off stage on a stretcher, and was seen waving to the crowd as crew members tried to block the transport with a black sheet, a clip posted to Twitter showed. Santana was overcome by heat exhaustion and dehydration, but was “doing well” later Tuesday night, a representative for the rocker told TMZ. He reportedly felt woozy and sat down in front of the drums early in his set, before collapsing backwards. Santana has performed 32 dates since March 25, according to his website. He reportedly took some time off the road after undergoing an “unscheduled heart procedure” in December, according to Variety.
