Another large parcel of Connecticut land that once belonged to a baking powder baron has hit the market asking big bucks. An approximate 52-acre waterfront spread next to Great Island in affluent Darien — the latter of which, a 60-acre private island, recently entered contract for more than $100 million — has listed for $85 million, the Wall Street Journal reports. Known as Ziegler Farm, this Long Island Sound-front property was also owned by the baking powder entrepreneur William Ziegler. Together with the contiguous Great Island, which the town of Darien itself will purchase in a deal that hasn’t yet closed, they’re some of the largest undeveloped parcels in the area, the Journal notes. Ziegler purchased Great Island circa 1900 as a summer retreat; separate branches of the family now own these lots. Ziegler Farm, whose listing images show a prime shorefront perch dotted with multiple species of trees, has just one building on it: an old cow barn. There are also two paved roads and fixtures including water and sewer lines. (Great Island, meanwhile, includes an original house and an equestrian facility.) The listing details the Ziegler Farm land comes with approved plans to construct up to 14 homes, meaning a big marketing nod to a developer looking to build a small community, or a deep-pocketed individual buyer with an eye on making a compound. The descendants are reportedly selling because their “lives are going in different directions.” Leslie McElwreath and Joseph Barbieri of Sotheby’s International Realty, Greenwich Brokerage, have the listing.
