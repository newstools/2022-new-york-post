Former NHL defenseman Bryan Marchment died unexpectedly Wednesday at the age of 53, his agent said told the Associated Press. Marchment, a 17-year veteran, had been in Montreal at the time of his death, where he was attending the upcoming 2022 NHL Draft as a scout for the San Jose Sharks. He had been with the Sharks’ organization in a variety of different roles since 2007. The cause of death was not immediately available as of Wednesday afternoon. Marchment had spent his lengthy career in the league as a fixture for nine different teams, including the Winnipeg Jets, Chicago Blackhawks, Hartford Whalers, Edmonton Oilers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Colorado Avalanche, Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, and the Sharks. He was traded to the Sharks in 1998 before being traded to the Avalanche in 2003. The physical defenseman tallied 40 goals and 182 points during his career. Marchment’s son, 27-year-old Mason Marchment, is a forward for the Florida Panthers.
