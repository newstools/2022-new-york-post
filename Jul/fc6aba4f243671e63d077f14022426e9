Your bag can say a lot about you. Why leave the message up for interpretation? Instead, take advantage of the customizable feature on L.L. Bean’s site and get in on the next viral trend — the ironic Boat and Tote bag. If you’re having déjà vu, that’s justified, since the Boat and Tote bag really reached peak popularity in the early 2000’s, where the taupe totes were seen everywhere from high schools to beaches and even in the office. However, back then it was the simple monogram that ranked supreme. Now, it’s a bit more tongue and cheek. For 2022, it’s all about the irony. The new trend is using the customization feature (only $8 more or free with the L.L. Bean credit card) and adding funny phrases, designer names and even inside jokes that make for perfect gifts. Affordable wedding party gifts, anyone? We think yes, as the totes themselves start at $45 and come in an array of colors and styles. The trend now has a viral Instagram account, too, run by @graciewiener, that has more than 23,000 followers and counting. The account goes to show off some of her favorite bags, including designer names like Prada and Hermes, as well as ironic phrases like “high strung” and “full of it” to name a few. Since the options are endless, we invite you to try it out for yourself. All you need to do is pick out a size and color for your bag and then click the customize button. Then head to your cart and add up to 10 characters, pick a font and color —  and voilà! Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
