LeBron James and Kyrie Irving are together again … at the Drew League. With trade rumors still swirling around Irving, and the Los Angeles Times reporting Friday that the Lakers’ stars have pushed to bring him to LA, ESPN reported that both plan to play in the LA-based pro-am on Saturday. Irving is expected to take the court at 11 a.m., with James following at 1:45 p.m. PT, per Dave McMenamin. So it’s unlikely they’ll be teammates unless that timing changes, but they will be in the same gym on Saturday afternoon. This comes just a day after current Lakers point guard Russelll Westbrook and his agent, Thad Foucher, parted ways, with Foucher issuing a blistering statement to ESPN that indicated Westbrook wants out. The Times reported that Westbrook hasn’t made a formal trade request. As for the Nets, the league is waiting to see what resolution comes from the fallout with Irving and Kevin Durant, who has requested a trade from Brooklyn. It seems likely that will result in a teardown, but both superstars should fetch a massive return on the open market if they are indeed dealt. If James and Irving happen to converse somewhere at King Drew Magnet High School this afternoon, we would be interested to learn whether all of this comes up.
