Arnold Schwarzenegger is being accused of cutting the cheese on set. According to his co-star, Miriam Margolyes, the “Terminator” legend, 74, deliberately farted in her face while filming the 1999 horror movie “End of Days.” “Harry Potter” actress Margolyes, 81, made a big stink about the incident on the latest installment of the “I’ve Got News for You” podcast — and she also claimed Schwarzenegger “was actually quite rude” during the film’s shoot. The Brit thespian dropped the bombshell allegation when the host asked her to reveal her least favorite co-star of all time. “[I] didn’t care for him; he’s a bit too full of himself,” Margolyes said about the former California governor. “He farted in my face. Now, I fart, of course I do – but I don’t fart in people’s faces. He did it deliberately, right in my face.” She then went on to describe the biblical action flick: “I was playing Satan’s sister, and he was killing me, so he had me in a position where I couldn’t escape and lying on the floor. And he just farted.” “It wasn’t on film, it was in one of the pauses, but I haven’t forgiven him for it,” the “Mulan” star said. In “End of Days,” the ex-husband of Maria Shriver portrayed an ex-cop who has to stop Satan (Gabriel Byrne) from procreating the Antichrist with a young woman (Robin Tunney). Meanwhile, earlier in July, Margolyes cracked up viewers when she appeared on the British chat show “This Morning” — and shared a stinker of a story about actor Leonardo DiCaprio. She said her “Romeo + Juliet” co-star was also a bit odiferous on the set of the 1996 Baz Luhrmann movie. “He was a bit smelly because it was very hot in Mexico and young boys don’t make themselves fragrant, they don’t wash all the bits!” said Margolyes, who played Juliet’s nurse. Margolyes then went on to jokingly advise the “This Morning” production team to take better care of their hygiene.
