The Beast arrived in Boston. Brock Lesnar surprised fans Friday night while appearing at WWE Smackdown. Multiple reports indicated that Lesnar walked out of Smackdown after the news that Vince McMahon is retiring as CEO and chairman of the company. Now, it appears it was just a storyline. The news was first reported by Bryan Alvarez of the Wrestling Observer; Sean Ross Sapp tweeted that he heard Lesnar was “pissed off.” Reached by The Post, a WWE spokesperson declined to comment on the reports. Responding to Alvarez, Saraya-Jade Bevis, who performed in WWE as Paige and recently left the company, tweeted, “If this is true, Michael Cole better bring that up on commentary saying he let the WWE Universe down.” This was a reference to when Sasha Banks and Naomi had creative differences with WWE and walked out — and this was how it was addressed by the TV broadcast. McMahon retired from WWE after 40 years of running the company, after the board had been probing $12 million in “hush money” payments to four different former employees with whom he had sexual relations.
