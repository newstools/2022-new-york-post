Two people were killed when an out-of-control pickup truck plowed into a fireworks stand in Washington, DC on Saturday afternoon, cops said. The disaster happened on Minnesota Avenue in the Upper Central Northeast neighborhood after 5:30 p.m., police said at a news conference. The pickup truck was heading north and ran a red light before crashing into a man on a bike and careening into the roadside fireworks stand and its attendant, according to cops. Both the cyclist and attendant were killed. “At this point, preliminarily, we believe the driver was suffering from some kind of medical emergency, but we’re still investigating,” said Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz. The driver and a passenger were being evaluated at a local hospital, officials said.
