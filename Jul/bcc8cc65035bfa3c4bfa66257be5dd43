Prince William fans can now vacation in the former helicopter he flew while serving in the Royal Air Force. Yorkshire businessman Ben Stonehouse located three of the bright yellow choppers in a scrapyard and gave each one a $250,000 glow-up. As Flight Lieutenant William Wales, the royal completed 156 missions with the search-and-rescue team based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, North Wales, from 2010 to 2013. Now, two helicopters — one flown by William — have been transformed into luxurious “glamping pods” at the Pinewood Park campsite near Scarborough, England. The other — which the prince used in his first mission — is now a seafront cafe. The helicopters were retired by the RAF in 2015 and were set to be stripped for parts. “I would have been devastated if they had been crushed. They have a special place in my heart,” Stonehouse, 30, told DailyMail UK. The inside of the aircraft look much different than they did when Prince William flew them. Now fully heated and insulated, the cockpit’s rubber and metal seating has been replaced with a plush double bed. Cupboards in the hall can also be converted into bunk beds for the kids, who can also enjoy a swing on its terrace. Each pod sleeps two adults and three children for $190.61 per night. “People need to experience them and see how big they are inside. A lot of the kids have never seen them fly,” Stonehouse said.
