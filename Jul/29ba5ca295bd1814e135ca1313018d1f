It’s red, white and f – – k you. Actress Jessica Chastain, 45, marked America’s birthday by flipping a double bird, presumably in response to the Supreme Court overturning its landmark Roe v. Wade decision last month. “Happy ‘Independence’ Day from me and my reproductive rights,” tweeted the “Zero Dark Thirty” star along with the image of her flaunting the obscene gesture. The tweet garnered a robust response from both sides of the aisle. Fellow actress Holly Robinson Peete agreed, saying “pretty much,” and former NBA player turned Twitter personality Rex Chapman replied with a broken-heart emoji. Other celebrities joined in with similarly outraged July 4 posts, including Bette Midler, who tweeted: “4th of July has been canceled due to a shortage of Independence. Sincerely, Women.” Television personality Padma Lakshmi made her own statement with baked goods, tweeting “#notahappy4th” alongside a picture of a cake decorated in red, white and blue and the phrase “separate church and state.” Rosanna Arquette marked the holiday by tweeting, “The 4th of July is now obsolete because women are not independent or free. Get your Boots off our Wombs.” It follows a week of angry social media posts from boldface men and women bemoaning the decision that leaves reproductive rights to each state. “They will never end abortion. Only safe abortion. This is not about life. It’s about control. Those motherf – – kers,” Sophia Bush tweeted after news broke. Amy Schumer, Viola Davis and Eva Longoria were among those who also took to social media to express their anger. And this weekend, actress Jessica Biel posted a picture of her and husband Justin Timberlake in Paris with the caption: “You have croissants AND Women’s Rights? Damn, take me back.”
