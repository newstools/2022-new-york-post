ST. ANDREWS, Scotland — I’ve never struck a ball in competition at a major championship. But this week’s British Open marks the 100th major golf championship I’ve covered as a sports writer, almost all of which have come while working at The Post. In my mind, that makes me one of the most fortunate sports writers on the face of the planet. What more could I ask than to mark this milestone by reporting on the 150th British Open from St. Andrews, the so-called Home of Golf?
