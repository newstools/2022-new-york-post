The Dodgers had a 10th defender on Sunday against the Giants. Kaitlin, a ball girl for Los Angeles, accidentally fielded a Yermin Mercedes ground ball she originally believed was foul during the second inning of Sunday’s game. As the ball passed the Dodgers’ Max Muncy on the third base foul line, the ball girl positioned herself, fielded the ball, and effectively gave Mercedes a ground rule double. Kaitlin then did her job, tossing the ball underhand to fans before placing herself back down in her seat to wait for the next foul hit. The ball girl was later told Mercedes’ hit was a fair ball, which gave Kaitlin a moment of confusion With the free double, the Giants loaded up the bases but failed to score. Clayton Kershaw struck out Joey Bart to close out the top of the inning. The two California teams are currently in the middle of a four-game series.
