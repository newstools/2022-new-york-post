After his team lost a little league game, a Texas coach from the losing team — who also happens to be a cop — was recorded getting rough with children from the winning team over the weekend, according to local reports. Kenneth Wendt can be seen forcefully slapping the children’s hands and even bumping one kid during the end-of-game handshake line on Saturday, video from the Houston game showed, according to a report by local TV station KHOU. The boys who were slapped can also be heard commenting on how hard they were hit. “That coach pull me back,” says one child in the video. Another boy says he got hit in the head. “Nothing in the world gives you the right to do that to kids,” Victor Torres, a coach for the winning team, told KHOU. Wendt, who coached a team called the Scorpions for kids 9 years old and younger, was officially removed from his position as a coach the day after the game. “His actions were unacceptable and do not align with our organization’s values. We removed him from coaching and from our club about 8:30 a.m. Sunday,” said the team in a statement to the TV station. The video has also caught the attention of the Harris County Precinct 5 Constable’s Office, where Wendt is a sergeant, according to the constable’s Facebook page. The office was was investigating the video, according to the local station. However, a parent who knows Wendt came to his defense anonymously. “We have known the Wendt family for two years and Kenny has always been a great husband, father, and coach. He spends an extraordinary amount of time in coaching and helping kids and their families both on and off the field,” the parent told KHOU. Wendt did not immediately reply to The Post’s request for comment.
