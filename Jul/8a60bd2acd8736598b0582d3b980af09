Though many parents and guardians probably can’t relate to Lane Kiffin’s coaching career, they may be kindred spirits elsewhere, perhaps when it comes to the spending of their loved ones. Landry Kiffin, the daughter of the Ole Miss coach, posted a TikTok video Wednesday that captured her father’s reaction to a shopping spree at Zara. In the clip, he asks his other daughter Presley what the bill was, and upon hearing the total amount — $721 to be exact — Kiffin can be seen checking his pulse as a result. “When you tell your dad how much you spent at Zara,” Landry wrote over the clip. Unfortunately for Kiffin, many may not sympathize with him over this bill, though. The 47-year-old coach is slated to make $7.25 million for the 2022 season, and that value will increase to $7.55 million by the contract’s end in 2015. Still, it’s nice to see a relatable response from a man of his stature.
