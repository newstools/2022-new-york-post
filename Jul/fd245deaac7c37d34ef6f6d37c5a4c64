It’s apparently over between Sean Avery and wife Hilary Rhoda. Rhoda, a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit alum, has filed for divorce from the retired NHL player, citing “irreconcilable differences,” TMZ reported Tuesday. Avery, who played in the NHL for 13 seasons — including two stints with the New York Rangers — married Rhoda in 2015. The pair separated on July 17, per the court docs, which were filed in Los Angeles earlier this week. Rhoda, who welcomed son Nash Hollis with Avery in July 2020, has requested physical custody but wants to share legal custody with her ex. Avery, 42, and Rhoda, 35, are said to have a prenup. Though Avery retired from the NHL in 2012, he attempted to make a hockey comeback earlier this year after signing with the ECHL’s Orlando Solar Bears in February. He was released two days after signing with the team. The controversial athlete has also dealt with issues off the ice since, including a 2016 restraining order for harassing his mother-in-law. Avery was also found guilty of criminal mischief in June for using a scooter to hit a car that was blocking a Manhattan bike lane. In 2009, Avery — then a member of the Stars — was suspended by the NHL for referring to actress Elisha Cuthbert as his “sloppy seconds” after the two broke up and she was dating the Flames’ Dion Phaneuf. .
