A group of masked men busted into an upscale Soho bike store and robbed 50 e-scooters in a brazen 5-hour heist, a report said. More than a dozen robbers broke into Inokim Electric Scooter Shop on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan and cleared out the entire inventory of pricey electric scooters — which cost $2,000 to $3,000 each, according to CBS2. The shop owner said the theft was meticulously planned ahead of time. “It was planned, it was executed,” owner Max Beckman told CBS2. “We counted about 16 individuals, 16 perps, who came in and came out with our scooter, two or three scooter at a time and just went in some direction.” About two weeks ago, the thieves broke the lockbox outside the storefront and pulled the key from it to break in, Beckman added. Police believe the break-in is part of a ring that targets lockboxes of businesses. E-bikes are particularly lucrative for thieves trying to resell to make a quick buck this summer. The NYPD has arrested four of the 16 suspects for burglary and possession of stolen property.
