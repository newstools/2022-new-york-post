An Iranian bride tragically died at her own wedding after getting hit by a stray bullet during a round of celebratory gunfire. Mahvash Leghaei, 24, had reportedly just tied the knot when a male guest decided to mark the occasion by firing off some ceremonial gunshots — a custom that’s illegal in Iran. Unfortunately, the shooter’s festive firearm display, in which he allegedly used an unlicensed hunting rifle, backfired horribly: While the first shot went off without incident, a second round reportedly went through Leghaei’s skull and brain before hitting two male guests, according to reports. “We had an emergency call of a shooting at a wedding hall in Firuzabad city and officers were dispatched immediately,” a police spokesperson, Colonel Mehdi Jokar, told Newsflash of the freak accident, which occurred at the wedding south of Shiraz. Jokar chalked up the marital misfire to “crowds” and a “poor control of the weapon.” The bride subsequently went into a coma and later succumbed to her wounds. Fortunately, the other two victims survived with minor injuries. Following the incident, the unnamed shooter — who is reportedly a cousin of the groom — allegedly fled the scene with the weapon in tow, but was apprehended by police shortly thereafter. “Naturally, any disturbance of public order like this crosses the red line with the police, and people need to know that to create a safe community, shooting is banned at weddings,” said Jokar. “We will take tough action against anybody found to be breaking this rule.” Before her death, Leghaei had been a social worker who helped drug users beat their addictions. In line with her wishes, the victim’s family has since donated her organs to three recipients. In a similar wedding disaster last month, a groom accidentally shot a member of his wedding party to death during ceremonial gunfire in India.
