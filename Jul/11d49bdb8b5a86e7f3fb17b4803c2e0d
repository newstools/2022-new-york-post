Lane Lambert has his staff. The Islanders announced Tuesday that Doug Houda and Brian Wiseman have been brought on as assistant coaches, filling the roles previously held by Jim Hiller and John Gruden. As of now, the associate coaching title that Lambert held prior to being promoted is still not filled. Houda last worked as an assistant coach on Jeff Blashill’s staff in Detroit, and had a longtime role in Boston stretching back to the Bruins’ 2011 Stanley Cup victory. His 17-year playing career included two seasons with the Islanders from 1996-98. Wiseman was an assistant with the Oilers for the past three seasons, coming from the University of Michigan, where he worked from 2012-19. Wiseman also has a local connection from his playing career, having been drafted by the Rangers in 1991. He also played with Lambert on the IHL’s Houston Aeros from 1998-2000. Their respective roles were not specified by the team’s press release. Piero Greco remains the team’s goaltending coach.
