We love cooking at our own place, but what about a culinary trip to Africa? Specifically, the team at Our Place stopped by the country of Morocco for this newest launch — a beautiful tagine. The tagine ($80) or a cone-shaped lid, is handmade by artisans in Marrakech, Morocco, so no two are alike. The traditional piece of cookware is used to keep the contents continually basting for optimal flavor and texture. Note: the word tagine is also the dish typically cooked inside, which is a slow-cooked, savory stew of meat, fruits and more. “The tagine’s conical shape means condensation drips down the sides back into whatever’s cooking in the Always Pan, so your food is extra tender, juicy, and flavorful, every time,” reads the site. The coolest part about this lid is that is was designed to fit snuggly onto your beloved Always Pan, adding yet another function to the multi-purpose pan. Shop the tagine now and the folks at Our Place will sweeten the deal even more, sending along a free Tiny Tagine spices holder and a bottle of Ras El Hanout, which is a warm blend of Moroccan spices. The tagine is part of Our Place’s new Traditionware collection, with the mission to celebrate culture through food and togetherness. Earlier in the year, the company debuted the Flipping Platter for the Lunar New Year. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
