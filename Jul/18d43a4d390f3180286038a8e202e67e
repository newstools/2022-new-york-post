Carlos Rodón’s wife Ashley summed up the Giants pitcher’s All-Star snub in three letters: “Wtf.” Taking to Twitter on Sunday, Ashley voiced her displeasure over Rodón, 29, being left off the list for the National League team. “Are you actually kidding….,” Ashley wrote alongside a crying laughing face emoji. “Man leads the NL in WAR. Wtf.” Rodón, who signed a two-year, $44 million deal with the Giants in March following seven seasons with the White Sox, currently holds a 3.7 Wins Above Replacement value, according to FanGraphs. He ranks as one of the league’s leaders, in addition to Kevin Gausman of the Blue Jays. Ashley later followed up with a separate message, “JOKE. I literally have no words.” Ashley, who has been married to Rodón since 2018, is a vocal champion of her husband on social media, regularly tweeting on game days or resharing impressive plays. Rodón received his first All-Star nod last year with Chicago. Among the pitchers that made this year’s NL roster include the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw, the Marlins’ Sandy Alcantara, and the Braves’ Max Fried. Outfielder Joc Pederson is the Giants’ sole representative for 2022.
