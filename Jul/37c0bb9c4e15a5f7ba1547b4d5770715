Shocking video captures the moment two gunmen opened fire on a Brooklyn street, barely missing their target – as well as a girl in a wheelchair and a woman standing nearby. The footage, released early Tuesday, shows the duo walking up to their target – a man sitting on a scooter on Liberty Avenue near Junius Street in Brownsville around 7:40 p.m. Monday and letting off a few rounds. The man jumped off the scooter and ran off without being struck, according to cops and the video. A girl in a wheelchair, whose age was not known early Tuesday, as well as a woman, were standing close by on the sidewalk when the shots rang out, the footage shows. The woman can be seen pulling the wheelchair away and backing down the block. Her relationship to the girl is unclear. Neither the woman nor the girl reported any injuries, cops said. Police are still looking to track down the suspects. Both are described as males with dark complexions and slim builds, last seen wearing face masks, gray hooded sweatshirts, gray pants and white sneakers.
