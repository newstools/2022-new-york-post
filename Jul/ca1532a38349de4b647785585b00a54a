When Pete Alonso isn’t power-hitting, he’s powerlifting. Moments before taking the field at this year’s Home Run Derby, cameras captured the slugging first baseman deadlifting 135 pounds in full uniform. Not long before, Alonso faced off against Atlanta Braves’ superstar Ronald Acuña Jr. in the first round of the competition, defeating him 20-19, but not the full amount of time. Alonso’s 20 blasts measured out to a total distance of 1.6 miles and boasted an average velocity of 108.1 mph as they shot into the Los Angeles golden sky. His longest shot of the round went 480 feet. Alonso lost to Julio Rodríguez in the second round, ending his two-year reign as Home Run Derby champion.
