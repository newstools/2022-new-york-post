Observations from Thursday’s Giants training camp session. These are not padded practices, so it is always risky to take too much out of who is rushing the passer effectively and who is doing the job pass-blocking, but it certainly looks as if left tackle Andrew Thomas is fully healed from offseason ankle surgery. He completely stopped rookie LB Kayvon Thibodeaux in his tracks on pass rushes and this battle will be interesting to watch all summer. LB Tomon Fox applied pressure to Tyrod Taylor, forcing Taylor to pivot out of the pocket and throw across his body down the middle. He found Darius Slayton, but the ball went through the receiver’s hands. Slayton needs to impress this new coaching staff, as a roster spot is far from guaranteed, despite his speed and ability to get down the field. There were several drops by a handful of players. After a sweaty practice, a bunch of fans lingered at the far end of the bleachers, calling for outside linebacker Elerson Smith to come over to sign autographs. From far across the field, Smith heard the calls and gestured to the fans that he was on the way. He looked tired as he made a slow walk. The fans cheered as he came closer, then one youngster shouted “Get Kadarius!’’ Smith smiled but could not oblige, as Kadarius Toney was already inside the building. LB Blake Martinez continues to make strides, seeing increased workload in the team periods as the Giants continue to bring him along following ACL surgery.
