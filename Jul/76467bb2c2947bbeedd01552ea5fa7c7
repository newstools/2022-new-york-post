Rage Against the Machine’s guitarist Tom Morello was accidentally tackled by a security guard pursuing a fan who jumped on stage during the band’s concert in Canada over the weekend. Video captured by a concert-goer shows Morello, 58, even falling off stage briefly as a result of the direct hit inside the packed Scotiabank Arena in Toronto on Saturday night. The unruly fan can be seen running up one side of the stage, as a security guard chases him. But the guard then runs into Morello — instead of the fan — and sends the guitarist flying off the stage, according to the footage. It took about ten seconds after the hit for lead singer Zack de la Rocha to notice that one of his bandmates was down, yelling repeatedly “hold up, hold up, hold up” as the music stopped. De la Rocha was sitting down during the show because he suffered a leg injury during a previous concert. Morello popped back up and then pumped his arms in the air as fans went wild. An animated Morello following the tackle seemed unharmed as the band restarted its final song of the night, “Killing in the Name.” It appears the fan who caused the stir was eventually scooped up by security off stage. Rage Against the Machine, first formed in the 1990s, played its first concert in eleven years earlier this month at the Alpine Valley Music Theater in Wisconsin as part of the band’s “Public Service Announcement” tour.
