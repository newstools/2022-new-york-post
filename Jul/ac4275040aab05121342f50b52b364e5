Former NFL tight end Kevin Ware was indicted in the murder of his girlfriend, Taylor Pomaski, who was found dead in Texas last year. A grand jury also hit Ware with tampering with evidence, specifically a corpse, charges. “Prosecutors presented the evidence to a Harris County grand jury, which determined there was sufficient evidence for criminal charges,” said Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. “We will follow the evidence wherever it leads and apply the law equally to all.” Ware, who played for Washington and San Francisco from 2003 to 2004, faces at least 15 years to life in prison. Pomaski was missing for seven months after she was last seen at a party at her home in Spring, Texas in April 2021. Authorities reportedly suspected foul play in Pomaski’s disappearance while prosecutors identified Ware as a suspect in June 2021. The 29-year-old’s remains were found in north Harris County on Dec. 2021. Ware is currently being jailed on gun and drug charges in Montgomery County, north of Houston. These charges are unrelated, NBC news reports. “We encourage anyone who has knowledge of what happened between Kevin and Taylor to come forward,” Lacy Johnson, a prosecutor handling the case, said in a statement on Thursday, as reported by NBC News. Ware has not played in the NFL since 2004. With Post wires
