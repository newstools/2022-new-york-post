Tyreek Hill is back at it with the comparisons. On his podcast “It Needed To Be Said” this past week, the new Dolphins wide receiver compared his new team’s offensive squad to the 2019  Chiefs’ explosive group – the one that helped capture Super Bowl LIV. “That 2019 offense with the Chiefs was stupid,” Hill said. “When I go out to practice each and every day, like I said, I see the same exact team. I swear. As far explosive, as far as dynamic, we have the same weapons.” Hill, who previously said his new quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is more accurate than former MVP Patrick Mahomes, also gave lofty compliments to Miami’s head coach Mike McDaniel. “When you add Mike McDaniel into calling plays, I know Andy Reid is great, but when you add [McDaniel] it’s crazy,” the six-time Pro Bowler gushed. “The way he dials up plays and his play-calling timing, I don’t even know what to say, it’s just crazy.” Hill, who was traded to Miami this past offseason after five seasons with the Chiefs, will be paired with Jaylen Waddle next season as the team’s two receivers. Miami’s blockbuster acquisition will hopefully give more throwing options, besides Waddle, to Tagovailoa come the fall.
