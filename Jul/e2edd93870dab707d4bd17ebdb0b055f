Dramatic bodycam footage shows New Jersey cops heroically dragging a driver out of his burning car. The footage released by Ridgefield Park police shows officers using a Halligan bar to smash open the driver’s side window of a Honda Accord as flames engulfed the front of the vehicle in the early hours Saturday. Three officers then grabbed the 55-year-old driver — whom the Daily Voice identified as IT analyst Christopher Vagnone — to haul him out through the window. “Come on!” one of the cops screamed as the trio grunted while pulling on the arms of the seemingly unconscious driver to get him out in the race against the flames. After pulling Vagnone out, the cops — Officers Anthony D’Elia and Nicholas D’Alto along with Sgt. Nicholas Triano — gave first aid, the local outlet said. He was released to a relative at the scene, the paper said. The officers battled “intense heat, broken glass and a host of physical barriers” to rescue Vagnone “without regard for their own personal safety,” Police Chief Joseph Rella told the outlet “They did a great job. We’re very proud,” he said. The force also highlighted the heroism on social media, saying it was “extremely proud of Brothers Triano, D’Alto, and D’Elia for their heroism in saving this man’s life while trapped in a car fire!”
