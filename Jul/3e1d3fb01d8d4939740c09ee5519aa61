He’s hoping to make it further than third base. A randy man has been caught on camera sexting an escort while seemingly sitting next to a young girl, possibly his daughter, at a Chicago White Sox game. The bawdy baseball fan’s X-rated activity attracted the attention of another spectator sitting in the stands. They flipped out their own phone and filmed the kinky text exchange before sharing the video on social media. “Pops putting in work at the White Sox game,” they captioned their clip, which showed the man messaging away with the sex worker. The frisky texts could clearly be seen in the footage, as the man’s text size had been enlarged, presumably due to his poor eyesight. “I can eat your p—y and f–k you raw, is all that correct?” he wrote to the escort, as the young girl sitting next to him remained blissfully unaware. In the video, the man then scrolls back up to an earlier message he sent, in which he is seemingly organizing a tryst with the escort. “Okay, so for a 100 buck gift card I get 30 minutes with you?” he asked. “I can make out with you, before getting into some really nasty stuff,” he further proclaimed. Several viewers of the viral video were impressed with the man’s messaging prowess. “Vibes!” one person enthused before another predicted that the saucy sexter was a force to be reckoned with in the bedroom. However, others poked fun at the man’s enlarged text size, saying it proved he was too old to be sending such explicit messages. “That is rank! Text is that large coz he’s an old man,” one stunned viewer declared. The date the video was filmed has been disclosed.
