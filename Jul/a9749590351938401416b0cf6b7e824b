Mom and dad’s night out. Steph and Ayesha Curry stepped out in style for a night on the town after the Warriors star hosted the ESPY Awards on Wednesday. The power couple cozied up together at Hi Felicia restaurant — a new fine dining experience in Oakland that serves California cuisine with Mexican and Japanese influence — where they enjoyed a 12-course meal, according to Ayesha’s Instagram story. They sipped on Domaine Curry sauvignon blanc — the wine brand Ayesha runs with her sister-in-law, Sydel Curry-Lee — that paired well with the main dish, Branzino, according to the cookbook author’s Instagram story. “Me & My Queen ,” Curry wrote on Instagram, including a photo that featured Ayesha on his lap, kissing his head. “The few times we go outside…” Ayesha took to her Instagram page to share a separate photo of the couple modeling their designer looks. She stunned in a dark Versace ensemble, while the All-Star point guard looked dapper in a black suit with a white undershirt. Curry also wore a diamond necklace by Tiffany & Co. — the same jeweler that provided his accessories at the ESPYs. “Mom and dad. ,” Ayesha wrote in her caption. The couple share three children together: 4-year-old son Canon, and daughters Riley, 10, and Ryan, 7. Prior to their dinner outing, Curry and his wife, Ayesha, 33, hit the red carpet at the Unanimous Media and Talent Resources Sports ESPYs afterparty, according to videos on Twitter. Curry is coming off a stellar year to say the least. He collected his fourth NBA championship after the Warriors beat the Celtics in six games to win it all last month — and he was named NBA Finals MVP.
