There are some tasks on your to-do list that are better to outsource (robot vacuums, anyone?). But unfortunately, there are some duties that you just have to do on your own… especially at work and school. If you want to be as productive as possible, it’s pretty tough to get things done without Microsoft Office. If you’re been living without these computer staples, it’s time to welcome them back with open arms during the Deal Days sale — we’re offering this fleet of must-haves on sale for both Mac and Windows at the lowest price ever, $39.99, now through July 14th.
