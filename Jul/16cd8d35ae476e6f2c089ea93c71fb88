Luis Rojas spent 15 years as a member of the Mets organization. He’ll be at Citi Field on Tuesday for the first time in a different uniform now that he’s the Yankees third-base coach — the job he took after being fired as Mets manager after two seasons. “I don’t know what to expect,’’ Rojas said of the reaction he’ll receive in Queens, where the Mets are in first place in the NL East. “Obviously, it’s a place I love. I love Queens and the fan base is unbelievable. They’re so passionate and they love their team. I’m grateful I worked there for 15 years and was the manager for two.” The Mets didn’t have much success under Rojas, now 40, finishing in fourth place in 2020 and third a year ago, although the first-time manager had to deal with the COVID-shortened season in his first year and other COVID-related issues last season. Rojas was at the helm last year when the teams faced each other in a doubleheader on the Fourth of July and on Sept. 11. “The atmosphere at both stadiums was unbelievable,’’ Rojas said. After being let go following the 2021 season, Rojas landed on Aaron Boone’s coaching staff in The Bronx. Rojas and his family have since moved from Queens to New Jersey, where Rojas is getting used to commuting over the George Washington Bridge. He was replaced by Buck Showalter and the Mets built a 10 ½-game lead in the division by the end of May, but that lead has slipped to 1 ½ games heading into this series. “I paid attention to how the Mets have been playing recently because we’re facing them and I want to get familiar with what they’re doing,’’ Rojas said. “I’ve always been aware of what their record is. Now I’m looking closer and can see how good a team they are.”
