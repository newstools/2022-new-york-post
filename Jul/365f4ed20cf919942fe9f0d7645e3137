The Emmys refuse to cancel Dave Chappelle. For his 2021 special “The Closer,” the 48-year-old comedian received a nomination for both variety special and directing for a variety special. The 2022 Emmy nominations were announced July 12 via livestream by “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” actress Melissa Fumero and 2021 Emmy-winner J.B. Smoove, who both star in the upcoming Netflix comedy “Blockbuster.” The announcement follows a heated controversy surrounding Chappelle, who made anti-trans comments in the special, resulting in a narrow escape from cancel culture. “They canceled J.K. Rowling, my God,” he said in the comedy special. “Effectually she said gender was a fact, and then the trans community got mad as s- -t, they started calling her a TERF.” Then, he unknowingly sparked outrage, declaring himself a member of “Team TERF” — meaning trans-exclusionary radical feminists. “I agree,” he continued. “I agree, man. Gender is a fact. You have to look at it from a woman’s perspective.” After Netflix walkouts, employee complaints and social outcry, the comedian took to Instagram to defend his joke, saying in a clip, “To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience, but you will not summon me. I am not bending to anyone’s demands.” While Netflix executives admitted they “screwed up” handling the egregious scandal, the streaming service didn’t pull the special, nor did it halt any future collaboration with the funnyman. In fact, while Chappelle’s documentary was pulled by distributors, Netflix quietly released his subsequent special “What’s in a Name,” as well as another project called “Chappelle’s Home Team.”
