Comedian Kevin Hart couldn’t believe Channing Crowder when the former Dolphins linebacker said he and his wife, Aja, attend a nudist colony. On the latest episode of “The Pivot” podcast — hosted by Crowder and former NFL stars Fred Taylor and Ryan Clark — Crowder explained that he and his wife of 11 years go to a nudist colony once a year. “We go to a place where like you walk in and everybody just gets naked and walks around… you just gotta shave everything and show out,” said Crowder. Hart, who was visibly shocked over the revelation, asked Crowder, “Y’all just … just hanging out, or y’all f–ing these people?” Crowder said that “there are swingers there [at the nudist colony], but you kind of set the precedent” upon arrival. “We don’t get down but we just like but we just like being around naked people together.” “You hear whatchu saying out loud, brother?!” the comedian asked, adding, “To be honest with you, I have no desire to be around a bunch of people I don’t know just sitting there naked.” Crowder’s admission came after he said on “The Pivot” podcast earlier this month that he once brought a stripper to the Dolphins facility to dance for former Miami coach Nick Saban.
