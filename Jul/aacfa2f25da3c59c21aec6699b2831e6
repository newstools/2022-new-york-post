One young woman was left with more than a broken heart when her boyfriend dumped her. She found out he was cheating on her — after she’d reportedly given him one of her kidneys. In a viral video that’s been viewed more than 16.3 million times, TikToker Colleen Le claimed she donated a kidney to a then-boyfriend after a year of dating, only to find out he was cheating on her months later. Le’s boyfriend reportedly suffered from chronic kidney disease and needed a transplant at age 17. Being a dedicated girlfriend, she donated her organ and found out the shocking news later, which she tells in a series of TikToks using popular trending sounds. In the initial video, she wrote: “excited my boyfriend gets a second chance at life after getting my kidney” on the screen — before cutting to herself lying face down on the bed with the words “cheats on me.” The TikToker has steadily revealed a series of videos since she posted the clip in January, with users still in disbelief over the story. “You better have gotten that kidney back,” a user commented, with many agreeing. “You’ll literally do everything for a man and they will still let you down in the worst ways,” added another. Le clarified in a comment she is no longer with her cheating ex, adding she doesn’t regret her decision. “On this day 6 years ago, I made the tough decision to donate my kidney,” she wrote in a recent video, showing a calendar with “6 year kidney donation anniversary” written and circled. “Despite the outcome of that relationship, I will never regret what I did & will continue to celebrate what truly matters & that is giving someone a second chance at life,” she said. If only she could have donated him a heart, too.
