A Missouri man will spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his wife who searched on her phone “what to do if your husband is upset you are pregnant” before she went missing in 2019. Beau Rothwell, 28, received the life sentence with no chance of parole in the slaying of his wife of four years Jennifer Rothwell, who was pregnant at the time, KSDK reported Friday. “We issued this case of murder first and as was stated in sentencing today, we never made any other offers. That was not an option,” said St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, according to the television station. Bell also mentioned how Jennifer Rothwell will never get to hold the child that she was six-weeks pregnant with at the time of her death. “We felt that this individual needed to be held accountable for his actions and that’s what we were intent on doing.” Beau Rothwell was found guilty of first-degree murder and lesser charges earlier this year. At trial, he admitted to killing his wife, but insisted it was not planned and rather happened during a heated argument over an affair he was having with another woman, in hopes of being found guilty of a lesser manslaughter charge. He testified he hit his 28-year-old wife with a mallet in November 2019. Prosecutors argued the husband was a careful planner, showing texts between him and another woman in the months leading up to the murder and a list of pros and cons he compiled on whether he should leave his wife. He was also seen on camera buying cleaning products a day before Jennifer Rothwell went missing, police previously said. Her body was found badly beaten a week after she was reported missing by Beau Rothwell. “To Jennifer’s family, words cannot describe how sorry I am. This should have never happened,” Beau Rothwell said during the sentencing nearing, according to KSDK.
