A cleaner contracted by the MTA was slugged in the face in an unprovoked attack last Wednesday inside a Brooklyn subway station, police said. The 71-year-old woman was cleaning the F train platform at the Stillwell Avenue – Coney Island train station around 3:30 p.m. when a woman suddenly rushed up to her and punched her square in the face, according to cops. The attacker then hopped onto a northbound F train that was pulling into the station and fled before police arrived. EMS responded and treated the victim’s injury at the scene. The NYPD described the suspect as a woman in her 40s with short dark hair and a dark complexion. She was last seen wearing a pink T-shirt with the word “hope” written across it, dark pants and black sandals, police said.
