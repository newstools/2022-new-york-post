Vice President Harris offered an extra helping of ‘word salad’ to Americans when asked about the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe Vs. Wade. Asked about whether Democrats had “failed” over the last 50 years by not codifying abortion rights into federal law, Harris gave a rambling reply. “I think that, to be very honest with you, I do believe that we should have rightly believed, but we certainly believe that certain issues are just settled. Certain issues are just settled,” Harris said told CBS News’ Robert Costa Friday. “Clearly were not,” Costa retorted. “No, that’s right. And that’s why I do believe that we are living, sadly, in real unsettled times,” Harris added. Harris’ meandering answer came in for mockery online from both the right and the left. “Holy cow what a bad answer. This is going to cause a Dem revolt. The GOP has been after this for decades. But the Dems thought it settled so did nothing?!,” conservative radio host Erick Erickson said in a tweet. “Biden-Harris: The Ron Burgundy—Word Salad Chef Administration,” added GOP consultant Erin Perrine. Emma Vigeland, a host of the far left YouTube show “Majority Report,” said the vice president’s answer was “incoherent.” “Is everything ok…?” she wondered.
