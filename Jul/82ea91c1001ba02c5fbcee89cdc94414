Former first daughter Ivanka Trump is “heartbroken” over the death of her mother Ivana, she said in her first public statement since news of the 73-year-old’s passing broke. “Heartbroken by the passing of my mother,” Ivanka Trump wrote in an Instagram post alongside old photos of Ivana Trump and herself. “Mom was brilliant, charming, passionate and wickedly funny. She modeled strength, tenacity and determination in her every action.” Ivana Trump, the ex-wife of former President Donald Trump and the mother of Ivanka, Eric and Don. Jr, died in her Manhattan home Thursday. She was discovered at the bottom of a staircase in the home at 12:40 p.m. and authorities believe she suffered cardiac arrest. The official cause of death has not been determined. A source close to Ivanka Trump told The Post she is in “shock” over her mother’s death. In her Instagram post Thursday afternoon, Ivanka Trump shared photos of herself as a child hugging her mother, sitting side-by-side with her head on her shoulder and a sweet pic of herself planting a kiss on her mother’s nose as she stands on bed. She also posted a solo photo of her mother, a former model, in a bright yellow ski jacket with snow-capped mountains behind her. “She lived life to the fullest — never forgoing an opportunity to laugh and dance,” Ivanka Trump wrote of her mom. “I will miss her forever and will keep her memory alive in our hearts always.” Ivana Trump, born Ivana Marie Zelníčková, married Donald Trump in 1977. The two divorced in 1992, but she kept her ex-husband’s surname. She held many roles in Trump family businesses throughout her life. The pair suffered a messy divorce that often made headlines, but were able to heal from the split and remained friends for years to come.
