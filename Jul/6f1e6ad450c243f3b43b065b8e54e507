Add “stealth strength” to reasons why not to underestimate women. A petite fitness trainee who went viral on TikTok for her epic 265-pound deadlift said she did it to prove wrong the men in her gym. “These guys didn’t believe I could lift the same as them. So I repped it,” wrote Alice Stamp on a TikTok with more than 34 million views. The video shows the 26-year-old science technician deadlifting the massive weight while the men in the background look on, dumbfounded. Stamp stands 5-feet-3, and weighs about 123 pounds — meaning she lifted more than twice her bodyweight, she told Insider. She was training at the gym in Portsmouth, UK, when a group of men were taking turns in lifting the weight. When one of them said he was nervous to lift it, she told them she was going to give it a go — but they couldn’t believe she could do it. Determined to prove them wrong, she completed not just one rep, but six. Despite their bewilderment, Stamp said the men were inspired by her achievement. One of them, known as the “floor guy,” told Stamp, “Jesus Christ, woman. You’re a f – – king beast.” Thousands of users on TikTok commended Stamp on her power move. “This is why you never tell a woman what she ‘can’t’ do,” one user wrote. “She will show you just how much she CAN.” “This is what we need! To show all theses guys were more capable of lifting heavy,” another praised. Stamp said although she’s found her gym to be a very welcoming place, she gets frustrated when people simply assume men are stronger. “I have no issue admitting that men have a natural advantage, but what’s frustrating is that ingrained thought that an average man who doesn’t lift, or comes a few times a week, is going to be stronger than a girl who’s committed to lifting,” she said. “I’ve never had a negative comment from a man who has achievements in his own right and isn’t clearly threatened and insecure,” Stamp added.
