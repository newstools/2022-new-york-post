The Boston Red Sox come limping into their series against the Cleveland Guardians on Monday night. After losing Sunday’s game against Toronto, Boston has dropped five straight and nine of its last 10 going back to before the All-Star break. The Sox will turn to Nick Pivetta (8-7, 4.50 ERA) to stop the skid but he has struggled lately. Pivetta got roughed up in his last three starts, allowing 23 hits and 20 runs over 13¹/₃ innings. Granted, those games were against the Rays and Yankees twice. Before those three disastrous outings, Pivetta had been pitching well, giving up two runs or fewer in nine of his 11 previous starts. The Guardians are expected to start Zach Plesac (2-7, 4.02 ERA). Despite just registering two wins on the season, Plesac has allowed two runs or fewer in nine of 14 starts and made it through six innings 10 times. However, Cleveland is just 2-3 in Plesac’s last five starts, scoring a total of two runs in the three losses. The Sox are reeling right now but Boston has been money with Pivetta on the mound, winning 10 of his last 13 starts. Pivetta has pitched better than his last three outings suggest and it’s hard to downgrade a pitcher who has struggled against the loaded Yankees lineup this season. Boston is 8-2 in its last 10 games against Cleveland. I’ll back the Sox to continue that trend on Monday at Fenway. The play: Red Sox, -115.
