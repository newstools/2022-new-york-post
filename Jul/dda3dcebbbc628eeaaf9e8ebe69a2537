Robert Irwin — the son of late TV personality Steve Irwin — recently opened up about how flattered he was about being asked for his number by an American tourist in a now-viral TikTok. Irwin said that he was flattered by Utah native Megan Grass who called him cute and asked him for his phone number, the Daily Telegraph reported. “I was very flattered by this lovely Australia Zoo guest,” Irwin said. “While I wasn’t able to give out my personal details, I really appreciated having a conversation with someone who definitely had a great interest and passion for the Zoo and my message.” The original TikTok, which was posted in June, shows the zookeeper telling Grass to send him a message on Instagram. When Grass responded that she did, Irwin said that he would “look it up,” leading several commenters to say that Grass was rejected in the nicest way. “I definitely was not expecting it to blow up the way it did, but it was a really cool experience altogether, and Robert was so sweet about it,” said Grass during an interview with “Today Show Australia.” “I think he’s literally the sweetest person ever. I was a stranger who asked for his number and he didn’t have to be polite about it, but he definitely was.” Currently, the TikTok has nearly 15.1 million views with an additional 2.5 million likes. The youngest Irwin sibling also revealed that he is still looking for love — but is not rushing it. “I am in no rush. It’ll happen when it happens,” he said.
