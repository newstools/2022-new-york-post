Two suspects have been arrested in connection to a string of armed robberies at 7-Eleven stores in Southern California that left two people dead and three others wounded earlier this week, authorities announced Friday. The crime spree targeting the convenience stores began July 11 in Ontario, Calif., when a man with a handgun entered a 7-Eleven store at midnight and demanded money. About 45 minutes later, another 7-Eleven in Upland was robbed and the suspect ran off with about $500. Two other people also were shot and wounded, including a clerk. The robber then hit one of the store’s located on La Sierra Avenue in Riverside at 1:50 a.m. and shot a customer Russell Browning, 60, while he was sitting in his car. Browning said he lost his teeth when the gunman shot him in the mouth but the bullet exited his cheek, according to ABC7. About three hours later, 24-year old Matthew Rule was shot and killed at a Santa Ana 7-Eleven parking lot during an attempted robbery. Less than an hour later, the gunman burst into a Brea 7-Eleven on Brea Boulevard and Lambert Road and shot and killed 40-year old clerk Matt Hirsch. Authorities said at about 4:55 a.m., the gunman shot and wounded a clerk and a customer at another 7-Eleven in nearby La Habra. A press conference announcing the arrests will be held Friday afternoon.
