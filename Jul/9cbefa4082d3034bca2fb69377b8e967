A “secret” mansion privately situated behind a set of gates above the famed Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles has listed for sale, asking $29.95 million. Newly constructed, the estate has been pegged as a “modern retreat” boasting all the luxe amenities anyone can think of. Features include panoramic views from Downtown LA to Century City, showcased through a wall of Fleetwood glass doors, the listing notes. Sculpted by renowned West Coast designer  Roman James, the estate is made up of five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. “This house is a perfect example of finishes well balanced. It’s sexy and cool, but still feels like a place to call home,” Stefan Pommepuy of The Agency told The Post. “Roman James did a great job of pulling the expansive views into the home to create an intimate backdrop for moments alone or with guests, including all the features to meet a variety of lifestyles.” Lavish amenities include a game room, a wine cellar, a movie theater and a bar. Meanwhile, the fitness studio comes with a hot and cold plunge, a dry sauna and a steam shower. With an easy indoor-outdoor flow, the great room features a sitting area with a fireplace, a dining space and an open kitchen with granite counters and bar seating. The double-height glass stairwell allows for optimal city views, which leads to the upper level. The primary suite includes a private balcony with a spa-like bathroom, according to the listing. Outdoor amenities include an infinity pool, a spa, two fire pits and a built-in barbecue area. Spanning over 13,500 square feet, bonus features include a rooftop deck and a five-car showroom with an additional upper two-car garage. Meanwhile, the Chateau Marmont, which is known as both a long- and short-term stay for celebrities, is just a quick drive away. Blair Chang and Stefan Pommepuy of The Agency, along with Drew Fenton of Hilton & Hyland, hold the listing.
