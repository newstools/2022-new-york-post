Packages of frozen blueberries are being recalled across the country due to potentially unsafe levels of lead. Two lots of 1.2 ounce Natierra Organic Freeze-Dried Blueberries were being pulled from store shelves by manufacturer BrandStorm Inc. after a lab test found “the presence or potential presence of lead above” federally recommended limits, the Food and Drug Administration announced last week. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the batch, but lead poisoning can lead to “abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody or decreased urinary output,” officials said. “If a child is exposed to enough lead for a protracted period of time (e.g., weeks to months) permanent damage to the central nervous system can occur. This can result in learning disorders, developmental defects, and other long-term health problems,” the announcement said. White and blue bags of Natierra blueberries with the Best Buy Date of 12/2024 and the UPC code 812907011160 should be discarded along with bag with the Best Buy Date of 01/2025 and the UPC code 812907011160, officials said. The products were sold by retailers all over the country, including Walmart and Amazon. Refunds would be provided to customers by the vendors that sold the potentially tainted berries, according to the FDA.
