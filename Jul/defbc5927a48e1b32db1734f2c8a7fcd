Here comes the money. Kyler Murray and the Cardinals have agreed to a five-year contract extension worth a whopping $230.5 million, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported Thursday. The deal, which includes $160 million guaranteed, gives him the second-highest average annual quarterback salary at $46.1 million, behind Aaron Rodgers’ $50.3 million. Reports surfaced earlier this month that Murray, 24, and the Cardinals had been looking to close the deal before training camp, which opens next week. The road to resolution had been a bumpy one, however. Whispers of trouble in paradise first emerged in February, when Murray curiously scrubbed all traces of the Cardinals from his social media pages. That same month, the quarterback’s agent, Erik Burkhardt, shared a contract proposal to the team, urging the organization to “commit” to Murray long-term. Murray, the first overall pick in 2019, hinted in April that both sides appeared to be repairing the relationship when the quarterback tweeted, “I wanna win Super Bowls with the Cardinals, AZ is home.” Murray has only missed three games over his three-year career with the Cardinals. He’s thrown over 3,700 yards each season and has rushed for 1,786 yards in his career. A two-time Pro Bowler, Murray has also logged 70 passing touchdowns and 20 rushing touchdowns. Though Murray got his first taste of the postseason during the 2021 season, he will now be fighting for Super Bowl titles with Arizona through 2028 at least.
