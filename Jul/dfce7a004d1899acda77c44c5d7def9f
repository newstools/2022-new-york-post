A flashy Brooklyn bishop was robbed in the middle of his live-streamed service Sunday when gun-toting crooks accosted him at the podium before fleeing with $400,000 in jewelry, cops said. Targeted Rolls Royce-driving Bishop Lamor Whitehead last made news in May — when he tried to negotiate the surrender of an accused subway shooter but authorities separately nabbed the suspect. On Sunday, Whitehead was in the middle of his sermon at the Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries in Canarsie around 11:14 a.m. when three masked gunmen burst in, police said. “How many of you have lost your faith because you saw somebody else die?” Whitehead asked his congregation — right before spotting the armed intruders. “All right, all right,” Whitehead then said several times before hitting the floor on his hands and knees. The men took $400,000 worth of jewelry from Whitehead, his wife and possibly churchgoers, according to police. Whitehead, dressed in a maroon suit with a gold-trimmed collar and sleeve cuffs, was wearing a long gold chain and a large ring on each finger at the time. The robbers fled East on Avenue D after the crime. Two months ago, Whitehead had said he was trying to negotiate the surrender of Andrew Abdullah, 25, in the fatal shooting of Goldman Sachs employee Daniel Enriquez aboard a Manhattan-bound Q train. Whitehead showed up at the Fifth Precinct in a Rolls Royce to supposedly usher in the surrender, but Abdullah was instead nabbed by cops at the Legal Aid Society offices in Manhattan.
