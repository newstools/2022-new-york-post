Keanu Reeves may just be the nicest — and most patient — man in Hollywood. The actor is being described as a “class act” for his response to a young fan’s intense questioning following an international flight from London to New York on July 4. The exchange was captured by TV producer Andrew Kimmel who tweeted the exchange, which has been re-shared over 21,000 times. Kimmel said the 57-year-old “happily” responded the the “rapid-fire questions” the young boy was asking. “The man could not have been nicer, especially after an international flight,” Kimmel wrote. According to Kimmel, “The Matrix” star said he was in London filming a documentary and went to the Grand Prix, and although he doesn’t drive Formula 1 cars himself, he does ride a motorcycle. He also said he would be catching a Broadway show in New York (“American Buffalo! Mamet!”) and staying in Midtown. “By this time the kid was running out of questions, so Keanu started grilling him,” Kimmel recalled. “Why were you in Europe? What galleries did you go to in Paris? What was your favorite?” Reeves has gone viral in past years for being a “gentleman,” amid a surge in popularity some called a “Keanussance.” “I thought I’d share this because the dude is a class act and little moments like this can make such a big difference in people’s lives,” Kimmel shared. “We need more Keanus!”
