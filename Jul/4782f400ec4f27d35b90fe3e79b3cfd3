This diamond in the roughage is throwing the internet for a “loupe.” Competitive puzzle enthusiasts are straining their eyes trying to solve this optical illusion, in which the object is to find a hidden gem on a farm. The visual treasure hunt, originally posted on Reader’s Digest by jeweler William May, challenges viewers “find a lost diamond ring in this garden” — like a human metal detecting device of sorts. This task seems especially difficult as, at first glance, the colorful illustration depicts a pastoral farm scene with carrots, a few bunny rabbits, flowers and a wheelbarrow with seemingly no diamond in sight. Still cant spot the sparkler? Keep scrolling for the big reveal. [Warning: Spoilers Below] Fortunately, WM provides some handy tips on spotting the karats amongst the carrots. “Note: This puzzle is not to scale,” they write, adding that “the ring’s band is yellow, and it has a good-sized white diamond.” Still can’t find the diamond in the roughage? Not to worry, William May includes a spoiler image below that shows the infinitesimal bejeweled band wrapped around one of the carrots between a wheelbarrow and the last sunflower on the right. This isn’t the first visual jigsaw to throw puzzle lovers for a “loupe.” Last week, brain teaser buffs blew a gasket trying to solve this compilation of trippy illusions, which included a snake camouflaged in a tree, and a butterfly hidden amongst a pile of leaves.
