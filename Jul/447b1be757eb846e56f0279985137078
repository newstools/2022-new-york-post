The Elicto ES-800 serves as both a powerful cordless wet-and-dry vacuum and a spin mop for floors and other surfaces. It lets you clean efficiently, with a dual spin mop attachment that provides effective wet cleaning and dust absorption simultaneously. An inbuilt automatic water supply system lets you wet and dry clean at the same time, too. Aside from getting multiple types of deep cleaning done, this vacuum spin mop also works as an air purifier! The double H13 HEPA filter system has five stages of micro filters, so it collects fine dust particles and blocks 99.9% of the fine dust from inside so that your space sees dust relief and air pollution reduction with each use. Want to see what you’re cleaning? There’s a cool feature where a UV light lights up any surface while you disinfect, so you can see the deep cleaning as it happens. You can also choose between five different nozzle attachments that are prepared to get to even your most narrow nooks and crannies. Unlike many complicated vacuums on the market, this one designed to be easy to use and a great multi-tasker.
