Two sea lions brought a new meaning to “locals only” at a San Diego beach Friday, viral video shows. A video posted to TikTok shows the pair of marine mammals chasing away beachgoers who packed a small stretch of sand at La Jolla Cove on Friday. The sunbathers dart down the beach and out of the way as the sea lions waddle after them, the video shows. The animals eventually dive into the water and swim off without harming anyone, the video shows. The woman who filmed and posted the TikTok told NBC San Diego that the frenzied scene unfolded after the creatures were awakened from their slumber by a human who got too close to take a photo. “I started recording because it was really funny to watch for me because to see all these tourists getting blown away by these giant sea lions,” Charlianne Yeyna told NBC. The video has garnered more than 8 million views and over a million likes since she posted it Saturday. La Jolla Cove lies within the San Diego La Jolla Underwater Park Ecological Reserve, which protects marine life. The cove is known for its popularity among sea lions and seals that sunbathe on the rocks nearby and signs are posted warning visitors to give the wild animals their space.
