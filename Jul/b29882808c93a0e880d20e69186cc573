Paul Rudd has finally addressed the wild fan theory that suggests how Ant-Man could have easily killed Thanos in 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” in one quick swoop. Rudd — who plays Scott Lang-slash-the miniature bug man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — explained why the theory didn’t work out. The 53-year-old appeared in a video alongside “Ant-Man” co-star Evangeline Lilly (a k a Hope van Dyne and the Wasp) that plays on the Disney Wish cruise ship. He touched upon the idea that because Ant-Man can shrink himself to the size of an insect, he would have been able to murder Thanos (Josh Brolin) easily by crawling up his butt. “I’ve heard a lot of chatter out there asking why I didn’t shrink down, go in, and uh … kill Thanos in a really creative way,” Rudd said. “First of all: gross. Secondly, it’s much more complicated than that. Allow me to explain — ” the “Knocked Up” actor asked. “If only we had the time!” Lilly-as-Hope added. The video has made the rounds on social media, with fans sharing clips of the promo vid when they were aboard the cruise. “I sat down to dinner at Disney Wish’s Marvel-themed restaurant and the VERY FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS is Ant-Man explaining why he couldn’t explode Thanos by climbing inside his butt. This is the best thing Disney has ever done, 100000/10,” a fan tweeted on Wednesday. Another joked: “Thank you, Ant-Man, for trying to explain during dinner why he didn’t shrink down and enter Thanos’s a–hole and then expand from the inside.” Someone else argued that Ant-Man could have easily taken a trip into Thanos’ mouth instead of up his behind. The user scribed, “OMG the [Thanos] theory is just stupid. Thanos wore tight-fitting pants. Ant-Man getting into his butthole would have been a whole movie in and of itself. It’s obvious he should have flown into Thanos’ mouth. That was open ALL THE TIME.” “Now that Disney has acknowledged the joke the joke is dead, sorry,” another person sighed.
