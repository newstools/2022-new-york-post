Finally, some news about Mekhi Becton that isn’t entirely negative. Robert Saleh told the media on Wednesday that the Jets’ 2020 first round pick will be moving to right tackle for the 2022 season. Still, the head coach says that his days at left tackle “aren’t over.” “Mekhi is a gifted young man who can do both,” Saleh said. “It doesn’t mean that Mekhi’s left tackle days are over, but right now he’s young enough, just like AVT, to make that transition.” Becton showed plenty of promise to start his career in 2020, but injuries and weight problems have hampered his progress. He has only started 14 games in his first two years. However, now recovered from the MCL tear that ended his 2021 season after Week 1 and removed from the PUP list, Becton has a chance to solidify his place on the offensive line. George Fant played well in Becton’s place last season, which is likely a reason as to why he’s getting the position. Becton doesn’t mind the repositioning, saying: “Whether it’s right or left… as long as I’m on the five, on the field.” 2022 is a prove-it year for Becton. If he can come out and show the promise he had when the Jets drafted him 11th overall, he can lift them to one of the better lines in the league. A group of George Fant, Laken Tomlinson, Connor McGovern, Alijah Vera-Tucker and a healthy Mekhi Becton is sure to leave few scratches on Zach Wilson.
