It’s unclear when Hornets guard LaMelo Ball and model girlfriend, Ana Montana (née Analicia Chaves), started dating, but they aren’t keeping it quiet anymore. Chaves, 33, and the 20-year-old All-Star guard have yet to publicly discuss the details of their relationship — although, their flirty exchanges on social media indicate they are indeed an item. On Tuesday, Ball gushed over Chaves on Twitter, when he reacted to sultry snaps of the model posing in a sheer one-piece by Fashion Nova. Ball — the 2021 NBA Rookie of the Year — retweeted the photos, adding heart and flame emojis. Chaves replied with a red heart emoji in a tweet that read: “yours!” Back in January, Ball showed off the fashion influencer in a photo on Instagram that showed her modeling a hoodie from his LaFrance clothing line. Ball — the No. 3 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft — averaged 20.1 points, 7.6 assists and 6.7 rebounds last season. The point guard will change his No. 2 jersey number to No. 1 for the 2022 NBA season, according to The Athletic. Ball wore No. 1 his entire basketball career before entering the NBA in 2020. “I feel like No. 1 is just me, so I just want to be me out there,” Ball said last September. “Playing at No. 2, it just doesn’t it doesn’t feel right. I mean last year was cool because my brother, I said I’ll be No. 2 for him because he ain’t play his rookie year or whatever, I think he got hurt or something, so I wore No. 2 for him, but it doesn’t feel right.”
