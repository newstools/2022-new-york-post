Looking to live in a boutique building with big-name neighbors? Financier John Silvetz and model Deon Bray are listing their apartment at the famed Whitman, at 21 E. 26th St. by Madison Square Park, for $13.75 million. The intimate condo, built in 1924, consists of four floor-through units, including one duplex. Jennifer Lopez owns the penthouse, as Gimme reported exclusively, while the fourth floor is owned by Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky. The second floor belongs to NASCAR champ Jeff Gordon. Silvetz and Bray bought their third-floor unit for $10 million in 2013, as Gimme exclusively reported. It first went on the market for $15.95 million with a different brokerage two years ago. Silvetz, formerly of Deutsche Bank and BlueCrest Capital, is now at Eisler Capital, which came under fire after Russia invaded Ukraine. That’s because a Russian oligarch who is now under EU and UK sanctions, Mikhail Fridman, helped Ed Eisler launch his firm — one of the biggest startup hedge funds in Europe — in 2015 with $100 million from LetterOne Holdings, according to Bloomberg. Eisler then returned the money, according to reports. (Fridman founded LetterOne Holdings with sanctioned oligarch Petr Aven in 2013. That’s the same year they made billions — together with their partners, sanctioned oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and non-sanctioned oligarch Len Blavatnik — selling their shares in a Russian-British oil company, TNK-BP, to Russia’s state oil company Rosneft.) The 5,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, 5½-bath loft is smart-wired and comes with a private elevator landing that opens to a foyer with a long hallway leading to an open living/dining room and a chef’s kitchen. There are also 12-foot-4-inch-tall ceiling heights, wide-plank oak floors, a media room, a home office and views of Madison Square Park. The Whitman was built in 1924. The listing brokers are Jared Seligman of the Corcoran Group and Eleonora Srugo of Douglas Elliman.
