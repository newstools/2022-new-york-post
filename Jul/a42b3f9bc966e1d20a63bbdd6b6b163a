LAS VEGAS — The Taj Gibson era with the Knicks has come to a close. The veteran center, a Tom Thibodeau favorite going back to their days with the Bulls, was waived on Friday, the team announced, creating $5.1 million in cap space. The 37-year-old Gibson, who spent the last three seasons with the Knicks, is expected to sign with the Wizards, The Athletic reported. The Knicks have three centers on their roster in Mitchell Robinson, newcomer Isaiah Hartenstein and Jericho Sims, making Gibson somewhat expendable. Even at his age, Gibson is still a quality defender and has improved as a 3-point shooter, hitting 15-of-38 attempts last season. The Knicks have yet to announce their free agent signings — the team has agreed to deals with free agent point guard Jalen Brunson, Hartenstein and Robinson — despite the moratorium being lifted on Wednesday. Gibson’s release cleared a second roster spot for the Knicks, who already have Trevor Keels and Feron Hunt on two-way deals.
