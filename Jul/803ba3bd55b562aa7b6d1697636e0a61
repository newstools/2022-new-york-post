Andrew Wiggins is vaccinated against COVID-19, but the Golden State Warriors star would prefer it if that wasn’t the case. “I still wish I didn’t get (vaccinated), to be honest with you,” Wiggins told FanSided on Monday. For much of the NBA season, local ordinances in San Francisco precluded any unvaccinated person over the age of 12 from partaking in indoor events; that included games and practices at the Chase Center. After the NBA denied his application for a religious exemption, Wiggins received the vaccination in October. He was the last Warrior to get vaccinated, and noted at the time that it felt like he was “forced to” do so. Wiggins went on to post the best season of his career, averaging 17.2 points per game and becoming a first-time All-Star and NBA champion. When his $147 million rookie extension expires at the end of next season, the 26-year-old will be in line for another lucrative payday. “I was an All-Star this year and champion, so that was the good part, just not missing out on the year, the best year of my career,” Wiggins said. “But for my body, I just don’t like putting all that stuff in my body. So I didn’t like that and I didn’t like that it wasn’t my choice. I didn’t like that it was either get this or don’t play.” Wiggins previously mentioned that he is the only member of his family that is vaccinated, saying “it’s not really something we believe in.”
