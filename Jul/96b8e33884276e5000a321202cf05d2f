Could John Wick also be Batman? After voicing the superhero in the film “DC League of Super-Pets,” Keanu Reeves told “Extra” that he would love to play Bruce Wayne in a live-action film. “I love Batman, as a character. I love him in the comic books, in the films, so to get the opportunity to voice, to play Batman was awesome,” Reeves said at the “Super-Pets” premiere in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Complimenting Robert Pattison’s recent portrayal in “The Batman,” the 57-year-old “Matrix” star said he would jump in the Batmobile if they needed an older hero. “But there’s … Pattinson’s got Batman right now and he’s doing awesome, so maybe down the road,” he said. Of course, Reeves also would have to beat out “Batman” alum Christian Bale, who recently said is open to doing another movie — as long as Christopher Nolan directs again. “I have a small part in this film, a bit of a cameo,” Reeves noted in talking about his current animated role as the Dark Knight. “But even that — just to be a part of a project that [Dwayne] Johnson and Kevin Hart are a part of is awesome, and I got to play Batman.” The new animated flick follows the pets of various superheroes including Superman and Batman as they try to stop a villainous plot after the Justice League is captured. Johnson voices Superman’s pal, Krypto the Super-Dog, and Hart plays Batman’s companion Ace, who also has the nickname Bat Hound. The family-friendly film hits theaters on July 29.
