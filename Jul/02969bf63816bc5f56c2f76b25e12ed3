“My husband has been betting on your picks since the beginning of the year. Just saw his account, exactly the same as yours. You truly are a learned man!” Kathleen, Clifton, N.J. … It’s a thin line between “learned” and “lucky,” Kathleen. Thank you. Your husband is a brave, brave man. The Phillies? Playoffs? The Cubs visit and Philly should pad the win column. Chicago’s Justin “The Animal” Steele allowed three runs over six in his last start, a 7-1 loss to the Orioles. Steele has made six road starts. He’s 0-2, surrendering 18 runs over 27 ²/₃ innings. Philly’s Kyle Gibson made two strong starts prior to the break, allowing one run over 13 total innings and he’s 4-1 at home. 10 units on the Phils.  Texas toasted the Fish 8-0. Pablo Lopez (five runs, five frames) struggled. The Rangers’ Jon Gray (four hits, six innings) thrived. Attendance: 9,500. Truth is there were more people at Brooklyn’s McCarren Park Pool. Stitches (and Kathleen’s husband) are up +1,928 palmeiros.
