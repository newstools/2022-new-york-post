It’s over. No, not Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter. No, not Bidenflation. It’s the race in the AL East. The Yankees have clinched and the battle is for second. The Bombers are at Fenway. Jameson Taillon (9-2, 3.63), not the strongest link in the Yankees’ rotation, has surrendered 14 runs over his last 16 innings. But really, like the Twitter deal and Bidenflation, who cares? The longball Yanks have his back. The Bosox’s Nick Pivetta (8-6, 3.68) is coming off his worst start of the season. The Rays scorched Nick for seven runs over 5 ²/₃ innings. Pivetta had allowed only six runs over his previous 28 innings. We’re doggin’ it again. Take the Red Sox for 10 units. Good game. Great result. Down 3-0, the Reds (yes the Reds!) knotted the score in the eighth inning then scored twice in the tenth to X the Rays. Final, 5-4. Mini miracle has our account at +1,604 geronimos.
