A man armed with two Molotov cocktails was arrested near Union Station in Washington DC Wednesday afternoon after he threw one at officers as he attempted to light it, police said. Bernard McCutcheon, 26, was busted shortly after 3:30 p.m. after he tried to flee from two officers after tossing the crude device, according to the US Capitol Police. The other Molotov cocktail, which he dropped, was a tequila bottle stuffed with a sock and a  petroleum-based accelerant, according to authorities. Police don’t believe McCutcheon was targeting any congressperson or the US Capitol. He was also not involved in any protest, police said. Two other bottles of liquid in his bookbag were also recovered at the scene, police said. The two Capitol Police officers were treated for minor injuries. “Thankfully they are going to be ok,” said acting Assistant Chief of Police for Uniformed Operations Sean Gallagher in a statement. “We appreciate their quick action that, without a doubt, kept the community safer.” McCutcheon, of Washington, DC, was charged with two counts of assault on a police officer, one count of possession of a Molotov cocktail, and one count of assault with a deadly weapon.
