There’s no other person perfect enough to don Ken’s sexy abs, iridescent blond hair and plastic smile than Ryan Gosling. The Canadian actor, 41, is starring as the iconic Mattel doll alongside Margot Robbie in the upcoming “Barbie” flick — but he only realized the role was truly meant for him after witnessing a striking omen in his backyard. “Best script I’ve ever read,” the “Gray Man” star said of the comedy by Greta Gerwig, who had emailed him a copy to look over before accepting, as he divulged during an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” “I walk out in the backyard. You know where I found Ken, Jimmy? Face down in the mud next to a squished lemon,” Gosling told the host. He had stumbled on his daughters’ toy lying in the dirt, so he saw it as a good sign — and took a photo of the doll and texted it to the “Lady Bird” director, writing: “I shall be your Ken, for this story must be told.” He also touched upon the reactions to photos that have dropped showing him and Robbie, 32, in full — oft-neon — Barbie couture. “I was surprised how, you know, some people were clutching their pearls at my Ken as though they ever thought about Ken for a second before this,” he said. “They never played with Ken. Nobody plays with Ken, man. “He’s an accessory and not even one of the cool ones,” the father of two declared. Gosling also recently suggested his character is a bit of a loser in an interview with “Entertainment Tonight.” “That Ken life is even harder than the ‘Gray Man’ life, I think,” he revealed, referring to his hunted spy character in his new Netflix film. “Ken’s got no money, he’s got no job, he’s got no car, he’s got no house. He’s going through some stuff,” he added. However, he clarified his comments to Fallon, saying: “Those are not plot details. These are just objective facts about Ken. That’s the Ken life.”
