Big Apple cheaters will have to find a new spot for their clandestine quickies. The Liberty Inn – Manhattan’s most famous short-stay, hot-sheets motel, and the only one with High Line cachet – is up for sale, The Post has learned. The owners, listed in public records as Duanco Inc., hope to fetch in the mid-$20 millions through sale brokers B6 Real Estate Advisors. The Liberty at 500 W. 14th St. has 6,735 square feet but can be demolished for a building nearly twice as large under zoning rules, according to sources. Couples seeking private space for their prurient needs have slinked into the triangular, three-story brick hideaway for more than 40 years, confident that it’s cleaner and safer than standard no-tell motels. Walk-ins can pay in cash. The Liberty touts itself as “the highest-rated romantic short-stay hotel” in the city. It boasts “Amour Rooms” where “stylish colorful décor with romantic accents” make for a “unique and lively experience and pricier “Romantic Interlude Rooms” with “eye-catching murals, mood lighting and a two-person Jacuzzi.” Rates are $95-135 for two-to-four hours for Amour digs and $115-$160 for Romantic Interludes. In the early 1980s, The Liberty shared part of its ground floor with the notorious gay S&M club The Anvil. But it’s now a prime Meatpacking District development site.  The Liberty stands between the High Line Park and the Little Island, the park-on-a-pier in the Hudson. It’s close by the Whitney Museum, Google headquarters and scores of trendy stores and restaurants. But its lusty days are coming to an unhappy ending.
