Newlyweds Sean McVay and Veronika Khomyn stepped out in style for the 2022 ESPY Awards on Wednesday. The Los Angeles Rams head coach, 36, posed alongside his new wife on the red carpet at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where McVay donned a light grey suit with a blood orange-colored lapel and white sneakers. Khomyn, who is a luxury real estate agent, dazzled in a silver cut-out dress that featured a plunging neckline and sheer floor-length skirt. The Ukrainian-born beauty accessorized with a pair of white open-toe heels and a beige clutch. Khomyn took to her Instagram stories on Wednesday to share a red carpet photo with McVay at the ESPYs, which is believed to be one of the couple’s first public appearances since they tied the knot in June. Khomyn also posted a snap from the nearby Hollywood hotspot The Nice Guy, where she and McVay posed with Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris and his wife, Nicole Marie. McVay and Khomyn’s ESPYs appearance comes just a few weeks after they enjoyed a romantic getaway, where she documented the coach partaking in watersports over Fourth of July weekend. McVay has been living his best life this summer after he coached the Rams to a Super Bowl title against the Bengals in February. Last month, he and Khomyn became husband and wife in a lavish ceremony at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where the newlyweds celebrated with family, friends, and a few Rams players. In fact, free-agent wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. — who won his first Super Bowl with the Rams — crashed the wedding, as McVay recounted on the “I AM ATHLETE” podcast. McVay and Khomyn dated for several years before they wed, with the coach making an appearance on her Instagram page as early as 2016. They got engaged in 2019. McVay, who is entering his sixth season as head coach of the Rams, is gearing up for training camp that begins on Wednesday.
