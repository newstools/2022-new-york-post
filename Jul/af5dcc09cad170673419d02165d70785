New surveillance footage captures two men wanted in connection to the shooting this week of a 12-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy in the Bronx. The clip, released late Tuesday, shows the duo inside a moving dark-colored sedan before the car stops and the driver gets out. He can be seen lifting the hood and fiddling with something before getting back inside and riding off. Police say a gunman inside the car opened fire, striking the boy in the chin and the girl in the arm and side. The teen boy, Denzel Gamboa, told The Post that he was hanging out on Rev. James A. Polite Boulevard near East 163rd Street in Woodstock around 11:30 p.m. Monday near the girl when both were shot by someone who rolled up in a car. In an interview from his hospital bed, Denzel said that the bullet that hit him traveled through his chin and up to his eye socket, where it’s now lodged. Surgery is scheduled for Thursday to remove the bullet. “When I got shot, we were just talking standing in front of the high school. It all happened really quick,” the teen said. “A car came up, and I heard the shot.” “I only heard one shot, and my chin started hurting, and I started bleeding from my mouth and my nose,” Denzel said. Cops have yet to reveal a motive for the shooting that injured the kids, whose families said didn’t know each other. It was unclear who the suspect intended to shoot, police said. “[My daughter] said they were just walking home, and a black car pulled up, and two guys were asking if they were from around here, and when my daughter and her best friend looked at each other confused, they pulled out a gun and started shooting,” said Emely Victoriano, the mother of the pre-teen girl. She said her daughter was with her best friend for a sleepover and was struck as the pair walked along the street. “The mayor and the police commissioner, they need to do better,” Victoriano said. “They need to get these kids with guns off the streets.”
