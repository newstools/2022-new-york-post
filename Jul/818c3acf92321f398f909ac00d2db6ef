Conan Gray grabbed everyone’s attention with his performance of the national anthem during Monday’s Home Run Derby, albeit for all the wrong reasons. The 23-year-old Gray — a YouTube singer-songwriter-turned-pop star — quickly drew the ire of baseball fans everywhere. Following Gray’s rendition, fans took to Twitter to recount other stunningly bad anthem performances. Several drew a comparison to Fergie’s flop at the 2018 All-Star Game, in which a number of players — headlined by Draymond Green — struggled to keep a straight face. Gray, who has become a popular voice on TikTok, boasts over 21 million monthly listeners on Spotify.
