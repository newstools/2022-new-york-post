The All-Star Game that most closely approximates what its sport looks like throughout the year still belongs to Major League Baseball, perhaps more than the unwatchable versions in the NFL, NBA and NHL combined. MLB, though, still hasn’t figured out a way to alter the Midsummer Classic to stem what has been a whopping decline in viewership since its heyday during my childhood in the 1970s and 1980s. Following an unseemly 7-7 tie in the 2002 showcase event, MLB attempted to incentivize winning the All-Star Game by attaching home-field advantage in the World Series. That lasted from 2003-2016 before switching to the team with the better regular-season mark in 2017. That did little to stem the tide of declining interest.
