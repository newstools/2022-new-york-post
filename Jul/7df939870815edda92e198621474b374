A woman went viral on TikTok for flying to Turkey to get her teeth done and documenting part of the process. A 19-year-old named Anya flew to Turkey, which has become a hot spot for crown and veneer procedures, in May. In a video titled “worst pain of my life,” which has been viewed 4.2 million times, she bared her pearly whites all filed down and stubby looking. It was part of the process to get crowns on all of her teeth. Anya is hopping on the trend of what some smaller-scale influencers have been doing: sharing their experiences of flying abroad to get what they call “veneers” but are actually crowns. According to Insider, getting crowns requires two or more millimeters of a tooth’s enamel to be filed down into a peg shape and are normally only performed on decaying or broken teeth. Dr. Shaadi Manouchehri, a dentist based in London, told her TikTok followers that the procedure has the ability to damage a tooth’s nerve, which is why it isn’t recommended to be done on healthy teeth. Many of Anya’s commenters shared similar opinions, as one commented, “girl I work as a dental nurse and before then I wanted my teeth done too but in a few years you’ll be spending thousands on root canals and implants!!” One person even told her she would come to regret it, but Anya called the procedure the “best decision I’ve ever made.” Another told her that she wouldn’t have the same opinion on her teeth 10 years from now, to which she replied, “Get them changed every ten years so I’m pretty sure I will.”
