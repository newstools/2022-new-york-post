Todd Bowles was a quality football player, spending seven years in the NFL before becoming a coach. His son Troy has the potential to be even better. Troy, a consensus top-50 recruit and the nation’s second-ranked linebacker in the 2023 class, has verbally committed to play for defending national champion Georgia. He took visits to Ohio State and Oklahoma and held scholarship offers from basically every major program in the country. “It’s mainly because of player development and definitely the opportunity there,” Troy told 247Sports. “People think that they get all these linebackers, so you are not going to play. But it’s not like that. I think I can come in there and work, and I feel like the opportunity is there to get developed with the lifting, nutrition and support. Just all that stuff factors in and then, obviously, the coaching is great. Athens is also a great college town, but it’s quiet at the same time. So, you get the best of both worlds.” Troy, listed at 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds, has played all over the field at Jesuit High School, in Tampa, spending time at safety, linebacker and edge rusher. His older brother, Todd Bowles Jr., is a defensive back at Rutgers. Their father previously coached the Jets and is now getting a second shot at being an NFL head coach. He will enter his first season as Buccaneers head coach this fall after serving as their defensive coordinator under Bruce Arians the last three years.
