A third suspect was arrested this week in connection to the broad-daylight fatal shooting of a man during a Bronx motorcycle sale, cops said. Leonardo Hernandez, 25, was nabbed at his Bronx home Tuesday and charged with murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon in connection to the May 18 murder of Jefferson Hernandez, 20, police said. There is no apparent relationship between the two men. Jefferson Hernandez, of Spring Valley, Rockland County, drove down to East 144th and Exterior streets in Mott Haven with three other men to buy a Kawasaki motorcycle they found on Facebook Marketplace, authorities said. He was blasted in the head around 3:40 p.m. and rushed to Lincoln Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, cops said. The trio who drove down with the victim — in a black Chevrolet Trailblazer with a U-Haul flatbed trailer attached – were unharmed. Two other men have previously been arrested in connection to the slaying, cops said. Joan Vasquez, 32, was charged with murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon, cops said. Manuel Reyes, 23, faces murder, manslaughter, assault and weapon possession charges in connection to the deadly shooting, police said. Cops initially said they were looking for a total of four people in connection to the slaying – but didn’t have information on any outstanding suspects Wednesday.
