Josh Allen’s first practice of Bills training camp got off to an awkward start. Allen and his teammates took the field on Sunday at St. John Fisher University, where they were met by a packed crowd of fans and reporters, one of whom was legendary NFL columnist Peter King. Following an interview with King, Allen went to shake the sportswriter’s hand, only to be awkwardly left hanging. As King continued to deliver his outro to the camera – unaware of Allen’s looming hand – the star quarterback looked around in shock, seemingly unable to comprehend what was transpiring. After the agonizing situation lingered a few moments longer, King and Allen finally shook hands, prompting the 26-year-old to hilariously ask the cameraman if he had captured the interaction. Fans on Twitter were quick to poke fun at King, with one user writing, “You know you’re a big-time writer when you can leave the best QB in the league hanging.” Allen was not spared from the banter either, with another fan commenting “Josh holding the Bills franchise collection of Super Bowl rings.” King took the embarrassing interaction on the chin, taking to Twitter himself to write, “You know, that was a tad awkward. Sorry for that one, Josh Allen. Thanks for being a good sport.” The Bills’ pass-slinger, who is currently the favorite to win the NFL MVP at +700 odds, is starting to grow accustomed to getting left hanging. Earlier this offseason, his high-five attempt was ignored by fellow quarterback Matt Barkley as the duo golfed.
