Michael Fuchs, the ex-HBO chairman and CEO, has sold his East Village penthouse for $4.72 million. The buyer, we hear, is a tech founder. Fuchs, famed for fighting three baby mamas who wanted him to pay for child support, has owned the penthouse for decades. The apartment, at 130 E. 12th St., is 4,869 square feet. It features a 40-foot atrium and a private rooftop terrace with panoramic city views. Fuchs hosted many parties at the loft over the decades, including Oscar after-parties in the 1980s and 1990s with guests including Billy Crystal, Diana Ross, Bette Midler and the late Robin Williams. The three-bedroom, 3½-bath loft boasts a large screening room. The listing broker, who also repped the buyer, was Luciane Serifovic of Luxian International Realty. The penthouse was originally on the market as a triplex asking a higher $7.85 million. But when there were no serious buyers, Fuchs split part of the apartment off and is now selling a 1,705-square-foot, sixth-floor apartment separately for $1.99 million. That two-bedroom, two-bath unit boasts a gallery primed for an art collection (where Fuchs displayed his), a woodburning fireplace and a library that could convert to a third bedroom. The seven-story building dates to 1905.
