Rapper Diddy’s longtime New York City condo, which he lived in from 2005 to 2017, has hit the market for $5.99 million. Located in Manhattan’s Midtown West neighborhood, just a few blocks from Central Park, the residence spans roughly 3,000 square feet. The three-bedroom, 3½-bathroom apartment is in the building known as The Park Imperial, located at 230 W. 56th St. Diddy, born Sean Combs, purchased the home for $3.82 million in 2005. Twelve years later, he scored $5.7 million in an all-cash deal, records show. But he had a hard time getting there. The “Coming Home” singer, 52, first listed the home in 2014 initially hoping to score $8 million. It had a few price cuts over the years before it finally sold. The unit has undergone a complete renovation, with features that include wide-plank solid wood floors, high ceilings and customized finishes. The kitchen includes top-of-the-line appliances, a vented hood and a Sub-Zero refrigerator, the listing notes. The primary ensuite bathroom features heated flooring. Building amenities include white-gloved concierge service, the Imperial Club on the 47th floor, a fitness center, terrace views that overlook Central Park and onsite valet parking. More than 110 condos make up the building, which was built in 2002, with residences starting at the 48th floor. Whitney Didier and Hannah Tran-Trinh with Douglas Elliman hold the listing. In January, Diddy sold off his longtime California home, where his girlfriend Kim Porter died. Meanwhile, he expanded his footprint in Miami with a $35 million estate in the exclusive Star Island neighborhood.
