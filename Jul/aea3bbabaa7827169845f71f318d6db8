Hunter Biden called his step-mom Jill Biden a “vindictive moron” and “entitled c–t” in text messages after she urged him to go to rehab to kick his drug habit, according to a new report. President Biden’s 52-year-old druggie son made the remarks in a string of text messages that he sent in 2018 as he family were rallying to get him help, The Sun reported. In one particular text sent to his brother Beau’s widow, Hallie Biden, who he was scandalously dating at the time, Hunter went off on the now first lady. “F–k my stepmother for always being as much of a selfish silly entitled c–t as you,” he wrote to Hallie as their brief relationship deteriorated. He also admitted to calling his stepmom a “f–king moron, a vindictive moron” in a separate text exchange with his uncle, James Biden, just days later. In the texts to his uncle, who is President Biden’s brother, Hunter said he had raged to Jill that he was smarter than her. “And you do know the drunkest I’ve ever been is still smarter than you could ever even comprehend and you’re a shut [sic] grammar teacher that wouldn’t survive one class in a ivy graduate program,” Hunter said in the text. “So go f–k yourself Jill let’s all agree I don’t like you anymore than you like me.” In another text to his uncle, Hunter bemoaned that his own father allegedly hadn’t visited him during his prior rehab stints. “Litteraly [sic] has never come to one never actually called me while in rehab,” Hunter wrote of his father. “So that’s a little insane.” The text messages were uncovered on an iPhone that was found backed up on Hunter’s laptop from hell, The Sun reported. The revelations of the brutal messages emerged in the same week Hunter was repeatedly photographed alongside his father and the first lady in Washington. Hunter much of the Fourth of July weekend at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, and was then pictured watching the Independence Day fireworks from the White House’s Truman Balcony with his extended family.
