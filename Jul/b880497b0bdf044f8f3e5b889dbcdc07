Four people were killed on Sunday when two small planes collided at a Nevada airport,  officials said. The pair of single-engine aircraft — each carrying two passengers — crashed into each other at around noon at Las Vegas airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. “Preliminary information indicates that the Piper PA-46 was preparing to land when it collided with the Cessna 172,” the FAA said in a statement. The Piper landed in a field east of the runway, while the Cessna fell into a “water retention pond,” officials said. CBS affiliate KLAS-TV reported that all four people involved in the crash died. “There were no survivors,” the Clark County Department of Aviation said in a statement, according to KLAS-TV.
