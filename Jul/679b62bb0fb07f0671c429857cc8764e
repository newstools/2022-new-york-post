A daring upstate New York driver tried to pull one over on authorities by tacking on a “very poor,” hand-drawn inspection sticker to their vehicle, police said. The motorist had the handmade placard taped to a vehicle that was pulled over following a complaint Saturday in Fulton County, the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office posted a photo on Facebook of the “very poor” counterfeit attempt, showing a cardboard cutout featuring a bogus bar code and 12 squiggly lines intended to denote the months of the year. The phony placard also had “NYS 2022” in large black lettering, the photo shows. Faking an inspection sticker or removing an authentic one is a misdemeanor in New York state. The motorist, who has not been identified, was also charged with driving while intoxicated. The image had been shared nearly 500 times on Facebook as of Friday while generating dozens of blistering replies. “I should’ve went to this guy,” one observer cracked. “How stupid can a person be to put that on the vehicle,” another quipped. “Glad they got caught.” Another commenter said the unregistered driver likely “just had some bad luck” in getting caught — claiming her brother drove a car for more than a year with a torn “square of a newspaper” and a shamrock sticker serving as his inspection placard. “Never got ticketed,” she insisted. A message seeking additional comment from the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately returned Friday.
