Golf analyst David Feherty and NBC have parted ways, and he is expected to join the LIV Golf tour’s broadcasts, The Post has learned. Feherty is expected to be an analyst on the 8-to-10 LIV Golf tournaments each year, according to sources. LIV Golf had previously signed former NBC soccer play-by-player Arlo White as its host. Feherty, 63, has been known for his irreverence, which he first displayed on CBS for more than two decades before moving to NBC and the Golf Channel the past seven years. The Northern Ireland native was a part of NBC’s coverage of the British Open over the weekend. NBC declined comment. Feherty didn’t immediately return a message. The Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour has received blowback because of Saudi Arabia’s connections to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudis’ poor record on human rights. For its next event, the group 9/11 Justice has asked former president Donald Trump to cancel LIV Golf’s next tournament, which will be held at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey. Last week, TNT’s Charles Barkley said he was set to have talks with LIV Golf to be a part of its broadcasts.
