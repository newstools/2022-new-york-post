Mayor Eric Adams on Sunday slammed panhandling on highways as “dangerous” after The Post reported that down-and-out daredevils have been risking their lives to plead for cash from motorists. “It’s dangerous and we’re going to provide people with the services they need,” Adams said at an unrelated press conference in Manhattan, in response to a reporter’s question about The Post’s coverage of the troubling roadway trend. “If there’s an area where there’s repeated panhandling on the highways, that should be part of our track so that we can get the services there,” he added. Post reporters last week spotted brazen beggars approaching motorists in the heart of bustling roadways – including the Harlem River Drive and FDR Drive in Manhattan, and the Major Deegan Expressway in The Bronx. Cops appeared to be doing little to curb the illegal foot traffic – which typically takes place during the evening rush when traffic is bumper-to-bumper and there’s less concern of vagrants getting slammed by speeding vehicles. Adams said cops on the beat should be canvassing “for core issues like that.” The mayor said he had not read the story but would check to make sure officers are aware of the locations visited by The Post.
