Will Murad’s Deep Relief Acne Treatment ($44) actually put your derm out of business? Probably not, and we don’t want it to! But, it sure can replace them when it comes to your gorgeous skincare routine. The all new Deep Acne Treatment is a topical treatment that can be applied directly to outbreaks — especially those deep, uncomfortable ones. Formulated with plant-derived phytosteroid, the Murad solution gives you the accelerated treatment and comfort you’re looking for without the side effects of steroid shots or prescription pills. Simply dip a cotton swab into the treatment and apply directly to the blemish both morning and night. An invisible film will hold the actives in place longer while amino acid technology combined and max-strength 2% salicylic acid target the acne.
