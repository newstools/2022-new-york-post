A polar bear pleaded with humans for help after getting a tin can stuck in its mouth. The 2-year-old female was roaming around northern Russia when her tongue was caught in a can of condensed milk. In order to get help, the bear wandered up to a settlement called Dikson and seemingly begged the residents for relief. A video shows a man trying to help the bear, but the can appears to be lodged too deeply in its mouth to make much of a difference. One person told The Mirror, “The bear got so exhausted with the can, it was coming to us and sticking its tongue out. “But it was impossible to help without traumatizing the bear, so people gave up.” Eventually, a team from the Moscow Zoo showed up and was able to use a dart to safely tranquilize the bear, remove the can and treat any cuts on its tongue. “We hope that everything will be fine. We left some fish near the bear because she had been without food and water for quite a long time,” Svetlana Akulova, director general of Moscow Zoo, told Reuters. A vet from the zoo said that, although the bear seemed emaciated and dehydrated, she should be able to fully recover from her injuries. She is set to be released back to her habitat after a few days of monitoring. Experts say that the bear likely came across the can while trying to search for food in an Arctic outpost. A polar bear would likely never approach humans like this, but the experts are assuming that this was a result of how desperate she was for help and how weak she was from hunger.
