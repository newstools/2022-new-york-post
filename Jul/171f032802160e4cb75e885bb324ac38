The shooter who allegedly opened fire on a suburban Chicago Fourth of July parade was dressed in women’s clothing to disguise himself and aid his escape, police said Tuesday. Robert “Bobby” E. Crimo III, 21, is accused of killing 6 innocent parade-goers and injuring at least 30 others after he allegedly climbed onto the roof of a business in the wealthy suburb of Highland Park on Monday and fired off 70 rounds from a high-powered rifle. He then ditched the legally purchased weapon on the roof so he could blend in with the crowd as he fled during the chaos, Lake County Major Crime Task Force spokesman Christopher Covelli told a news briefing. “Crimo was dressed in women’s clothing and investigators do believe he did this to conceal his facial tattoos and his identity,” Covelli said. Police said charges were expected to be filed against Crimo on Tuesday afternoon. “We do believe Crimo pre-planned this attack for several weeks,” Covelli said, adding that investigators were still trying to determine a motive. “We have no indication to suggest at this point that it was racially motivated, motivated by religion,” he said.
