MLB All-Stars weren’t the only ones taking swings during this year’s Home Run Derby. In a now-viral video, a Los Angeles fan wearing a Clayton Kershaw jersey can be seen scuffling with a fellow spectator in the stands at Dodger Stadium on Monday. As the brawl continued, some attendees attempted to separate the brawlers while one guest can be heard saying, “You made your point,” and “Enough.” Elsewhere on the field, Nationals outfielder Juan Soto — who is currently at the center of trade talks — usurped the reigning Home Run Derby champion, the Mets’ Pete Alonso, for this year’s title. Soto recorded a total of 53 home runs in the three rounds. Fans certainly stole the spotlight during this week’s All-Star festivities, including an adult autograph seeker, who appeared to battle kids when attempting to score the signature of Astros pitcher Justin Verlander. The All-Star festivities concluded Tuesday night with the American League defeating the National League, 3-2. The Yankees’ Giancarlo Stanton was named the game’s MVP.
