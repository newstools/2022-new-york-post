Start your stopwatch. Puzzle enthusiasts are going wild over an eerie optical illusion in which one has to try and spot the 25 animals incorporated into the image in under two minutes. The illusion, created by an unknown artist, shows a man’s head made up of more than two dozen animals. It appears to have been inspired by 16th-century artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who famously painted portrait heads consisting entirely of objects such as fruits, vegetables and flowers. While the image has been circulating on the internet for almost a decade, it has recently gone viral on TikTok, with one user claiming that puzzle solvers could be in the top 0.01% if they manage to spot all the animals in the two-minute timeframe. [Warning: Spoilers ahead.] An elephant at the top of the image is perhaps the easiest to spot, while a viewer’s eye is also drawn to an obvious kangaroo and grizzly bear, both at the bottom of the painting. A tiger, a tortoise, a horse and a white rabbit are also commonly spotted in the center of the illusion, but things get more tricky from there. Some clever TikTokers have been able to identify the 25 animals included in the illusion, but few are able to find them all in two minutes. The successful puzzles solver are able to spot a goose, an elephant, a hedgehog, a dolphin, a snail, a gopher, a fox, a sloth, an alligator, a snake and a tortoise. The image also includes a whale, a kangaroo, a parrot, a pelican, a starfish, a grasshopper, a horse, and a rabbit. A tiger, a monkey, a bird, a peacock and a bear round out all 25 animals seen in the image. If you’ve managed to master this optical illusion, puzzle busters also loved this recent optical illusion, which asked viewers to find a hidden gem. Elsewhere, brainteaser buffs flew into a flap over this challenge, with only 1% of people able to spot the butterfly in this image of fall foliage.
