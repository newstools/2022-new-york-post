Two attackers pushed a 65-year-old Asian woman to the ground and took her purse as she strolled on a tree-lined Queens street Sunday morning, cops said. The victim was walking at 155th Street and 35th Avenue in Murray Hill when the robbers approached her and shoved her around 9 a.m., cops said. The two crooks snatched the purse out of her hands, cops said. There was no immediate description of the robbers, cops said.
