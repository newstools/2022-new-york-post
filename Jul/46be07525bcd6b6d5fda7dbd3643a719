Actor Brad Pitt has gone coastal with the cool $40 million purchase of a blufftop home in California. Pitt, who last week wore a skirt on the red carpet for his “Bullet Train” premiere in Berlin, snagged the approximately century-old D.L. James House in the Carmel Highlands along the Golden State’s central coast, The Wall Street Journal reports. His closing price marks this deal as one of the most expensive ever to happen in the Carmel area. The property wasn’t publicly listed for sale, the Journal adds, meaning it sold off-market. Before Pitt, Searock — a limited liability company attached to late Chicago financier Joe Ritchie and his wife, Sharon — had owned the property since 1999. Joe Ritchie passed away early this year. The D.L. James House dates to 1918 and was designed by the early 20th-century architect Charles Sumner Greene, who was respected for his influence in the American Arts and Crafts movement. The spread took its name from its first owner, the businessman and writer D.L. James. The house itself was built from local sandstone and granite and has arched windows and a tiled roof. It also looks to wide views of the Pacific Ocean.
