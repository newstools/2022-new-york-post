Let’s just cut right to the chase: you need this car cleaning kit in your life. When it’s sunny outside, you may think, “Wow! I should clean my car!” But, more often than not, you don’t have all the equipment and formulas necessary to get the job done properly. Luckily, with Amazon Prime Day 2022 in full swing, Chemical Guys is hosting 30% off its beyond-amazing 16-Piece Car Wash Kit. Two weeks ago, I put on my favorite summer shorts, unboxed this exact kit and got to work on my 2013 Volkswagen Passat (which is named Trixie, BTW). After recruiting my boyfriend to wash our cars, they’ve never looked so spotless. Specifically, everything comes in the most convenient bucket that you can fill with its included honeydew snow foam. There’s even a foam blaster if you prefer a more handheld option while skirting around your car’s perimeter. (Related: Best car cleaning products.) This 16-piece kit contains everything you need for a scratch-free shine, including a bucket to store it all in when you’re done washing. Something else you’ll love about this kit is how the entire bundle — collectively — is worth well over $200. For just $91 today, you’re scoring big. Some unique items are in the plastic bucket, including Butter wet wax, a Diablo wheel gel, Silk Shine dressing, a signature glass cleaner, a speed wipe detailer, a cyclone dirt trap (to tackle even the toughest of embedded stains), a short brush, four microfiber towels and more. Oh, and while you’re at it, pick up this life-saving life-changing car-cleaning tool for only $6 to do a clean-swipe of the inside of your car’s vents. So, what are you waiting for? It’s, by far, one of the best Amazon buys we’ve ever had the pleasure of using (and 100% worth the splurge to have on hand). If you want your car to sparkle, this is it.
