Carharrt is more than a popular brand people all over rep. Since 1889, Carharrt has been family-owned honoring the shared values of dependability, honesty and trust. That’s why it was no surprise when Carharrt discounted six of it’s bestselling Knit Cuffed Beanie colors. The Knit Cuffed Beanie, previously known as the Acrylic Watch Hat, came about in 1987 and became a Carharrt icon. Adored by over 2,880 reviewers and originally crafted as a workwear essential, shoppers can enjoy 100% acrylic rib knit and a fold-up cuff. Now, 13 of the original colors are still in full rotation, but we are sad to see six devout colors, such as Blue Lagoon, North Woods, Cantaloupe, Currant, Purple and Hibiscus go. Tip: You’re going to want to wipe your tears and sit up tall for this good news: Carharrt isn’t just throwing all of these gorgeous Knit Cuffed Beanie colors to the wind. Instead, the brand is marking down each discontinued color, meaning you can score a Carharrt beanie for as little as $8 and no more than $10. Depending on the color you select, you can save over 50% off a coveted Carharrt find. And deals this good — especially on brands that you know are worth your buck — don’t always come around. Don’t just take our word for how great this age-old beanie is — take these Carharrt reviews instead. Check out New York Post Shopping for more content.
