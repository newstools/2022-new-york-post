After going undrafted in this year’s NBA Draft, Shareef O’Neal has found a new home. O’Neal — the son of Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal — is signing a six-figure contract with the NBA G League Ignite, according to Shams Charania. O’Neal recently played for his father’s former team, the Lakers, in the NBA Summer League. He averaged 4.7 points and 3.7 rebounds per game over six contests. Before that, the 6-foot-10, 215-pound O’Neal participated in the G League Elite prospect camp in May. Charania noted that “NBA teams were intrigued with O’Neal’s athleticism and pedigree throughout the pre-draft and summer-league process.” O’Neal caused a stir in June when he conceded that his father wanted him to stay in school, rather than enter the draft. “I know he probably doesn’t want me saying this, but sorry. We’re both grown, we’ll get past it,” O’Neal said. “I know he’s an NBA legend. I know he’s my Dad. But it was right in front of me. I had to go get it. So, if he likes it or not, it’s not really going to stop me from doing what I want to do.” O’Neal, 22, played in just 37 collegiate games across three seasons with UCLA and LSU, limited due to a myriad of health issues.
