Scott Piercy entered Sunday as the clear-cut favorite to win the 3M Open with a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round of the tournament. Several hours later, he trudged off the green empty handed. Piercy’s downfall started on the eighth hole and became a full implosion on No. 14.Piercy reached the 14th tee box with a two-shot lead, but his wayward drive plugged in a fairway bunker. He wasn’t able to advance his next shot out of the sand and, upon taking an aggressive line from 163 yards, dropped his third shot into the water guarding the left side of the green. Piercy’s fifth shot from 92 yards away spun into the greenside rough, though the chip almost found its way into the hole. He ultimately tapped in for a seven, pushing him back to 15 under, two shots behind Tony Finau. Finau never looked back after assuming the lead and was later crowned victor after finishing 17-under to win by three. Piercy finished the contest shooting 76, which placed him in a tie for fourth place and the fourth-worst score of the day. It was only a day prior that the golfer had set a tournament scoring record through the first 54 holes, sitting at an impressive 18-under.
