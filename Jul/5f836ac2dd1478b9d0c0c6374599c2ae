The principal of Robb Elementary School where 19 students and two teachers were shot and killed by a crazed gunman two months ago has been placed on administrative leave. The attorney for principal Mandy Gutierrez confirmed the development in a statement to the Associated Press, but did not comment on why the personnel move was made. Earlier this month a Texas legislative committee faulted Gutierrez and an assistant for not fixing a lock to a classroom they knew wasn’t working before gunman Salvatore Ramos carried out the massacre in that room on May 24. This was Gutierrez’s first year in charge of Robb Elementary School after she had been with the district for more than 20 years, KENS 5 reported. She was previously a fourth grade teacher and assistant principal at the school. The Uvalde school system earlier placed its School Police Chief Pete Arredondo on leave and appears ready to fire him. Harrell, the school superintendent, recommended terminating Arredondo amid criticism of the chief’s actions the day of the mass shooting. The school board was supposed to consider firing Arredondo Saturday, but that meeting was delayed, KSAT-TV reported. “In conformity with due process requirements, and at the request of (Arredondo’s) attorney, the meeting to consider Chief Arredondo’s termination will be held at a later date, the school stated.
