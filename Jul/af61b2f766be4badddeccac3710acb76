Turns out Taika Waititi is a fan of Taylor Swift memes. The “Thor: Love and Thunder” director revealed that the sound of the screaming goats came from the popular meme of Swift’s 2012 single “I Knew You Were Trouble.” “The goats were always going to be in [the movie] because they are in the comics, but we didn’t know how they would sound,” Waititi, 46, told Insider. “Then someone in post-production found this meme of a Taylor Swift song that has screaming goats in it. I didn’t even know that existed.” After the release of “I Knew You Were Trouble,” a video was uploaded to YouTube that splices a goat’s screams into the song’s chorus. The video became a viral meme. Almost a decade later, the now-iconic goat scream is featured in the Marvel movie. “One of the vendors that was making the [computer-generated] goats” and for the sound, they put in Swift’s “Trouble,” but “the fan-made one with the goat sounds,” Waititi said. “We just thought it was so funny.” “It was just a shot of how the CG creatures were coming along. It wasn’t meant for the film or anything. It was just an update. And the screams were freakin’ awesome,” he added. Waititi shared that fans think the voices of the goats are actually him. “A lot of people think it’s me screaming,” he added. “It’s not.” “Thor: Love and Thunder” raked in $69.5 million at the box office on Friday’s opening night, according to Box Office Mojo. It’s playing in theaters now.
