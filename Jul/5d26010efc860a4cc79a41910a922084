The Jets on Wednesday added a defensive back just in time for the start of next week’s training camp, signing Craig James, who was released on Monday by the Eagles. James, 26, was undrafted out of Southern Illinois — he spent the first two years of his college career at Minnesota. He spent one season on the Vikings’ practice squad — he did eventually sign to the active roster and get into three games — and was with the Eagles the past three years, playing in 18 games. His only NFL start came in 2019 against the Jets. The highlight of James’ career came when he broke up a pass during the 2019 season thrown by Aaron Rodgers, leading to a game-winning interception by Nigel Bradham at Lambeau Field. James is considered to be a strong special teams player — he was a special teams co-captain for the Eagles in 2020.
