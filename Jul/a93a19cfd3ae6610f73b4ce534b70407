Heavily armed law enforcement officers swarmed former White House adviser Steve Bannon’s Washington, DC, home after an apparent “swatting” incident on Friday, according to police. A prankster sent police into a frenzy after calling 911 at about 10:45 a.m. and reporting that a gunman was inside a home in the 200 Block of A Street near 2nd Street, just steps away from the Capitol, and had shot someone, officials told The Washington Post. The caller then threatened to take his own life if police came, CNN reported. The home was later revealed to be Bannon’s. Members of the Metropolitan Police Department and US Capitol Police arrived on scene but saw no sign of a gunman or shots fired, police said. Cops said that people were in the house at the time, but it’s unclear if Bannon was among them. Police determined it was a “swatting” incident — when someone calls 911 with a false report to trick police into a SWAT operation on a person’s home. The call was not made from Bannon’s home, cops said. The prank call forced police to shut down several streets near the Capitol and Supreme Court while they investigated. Streets reopened by 12:30 after no suspects or victims were found, police said. “The police were terrific,” Bannon, 67, told NBC as he walked up the front steps of his home after police had cleared the block.
