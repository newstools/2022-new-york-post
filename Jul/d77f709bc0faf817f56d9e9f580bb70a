“Thor: Love and Thunder” is still hammering the competition. Since its release on July 8, the Chris Hemsworth-led Disney/Marvel Studios flick is cleaning up at the box office, raking in over $8.3 million this Friday alone, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. Last weekend, the film, which is the fourth installment in the Asgardian’s saga, brought in a staggering $143 million, per Variety. “Minions: The Rise of Gru,” whose henchmen The Post said “bring on the funny,” took home second place, earning close to $5.4 million. “Top Gun: Maverick” fell from the sky a bit by landing in third, with close to $2 million on Friday. A sequel to the Tom Cruise-helmed 1986 action-drama “Top Gun,” it recently flew past “Titanic,” snagging the title of highest-grossing Paramount film in its initial run in the studio’s 110-year history, per Collider. The 1997 James Cameron tear-jerker, which won a Best Picture Oscar, took home $600,788,000 in its first-run release, while “Maverick” raked in $601,919,000, according to Deadline. “Elvis,” the acclaimed biopic, took fourth prize, with the horror thriller “The Black Phone,” following in fifth.
