Thrill-seekers, fasten your seatbelts! The “tallest and longest single-rail coaster in the world” will open at Six Flags Magic Mountain on July 16. The Valencia, California, theme park will add Wonder Woman Flight of Courage to its lineup of coasters, bringing its total to 20. That’s the most of any other theme park on the planet. Brave Wonder Woman riders will travel across the 3,300-foot track, towering 13 stories and reaching speeds up to 58 miles per hour. According to the ride’s description, the coaster exemplifies the superhero’s “fight for truth and justice” and will immerse riders in her story and how she got her powers. The attraction has plenty of dives, banks and rolls, it said. Weary fans can see if their stomachs can handle the real thing by watching Magic Mountain’s render of the ride. “Single-rail” — meaning only rides on one rail compared to two that other coasters ride on — is the key word in noting the record-breaking achievement for Wonder Woman. However, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, will officially remain the tallest roller coaster in the world. Its upside-down U-shaped track bolts 45 stories — or 456 feet — into the sky, going from zero to 128 miles per hour in a startling 3.5 seconds. The track, however, is only 3,118 feet long.
