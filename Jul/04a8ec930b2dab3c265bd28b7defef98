Some staffers at the Amazon warehouse in New Jersey where a worker died earlier this month during the Prime Day rush are fuming over the e-commerce giant’s response — and demanding more information be released. Two employees at Amazon’s EWR9 facility in Carteret, NJ spoke anonymously to NBC News, claiming the man died on an upper floor known for high temperature. One of them said their deceased colleague had worked as a “waterspider,” a job that involves carting goods around the facility. The other said she asked her managers about his death but wasn’t given information — and told not to talk about it. She added that frustration at the warehouse is running high. “It’s scary,” she said. “We should know what happened and how did it happen. It could have been any of us.” The yet-to-be-identified worker’s death occurred July 13 during Amazon’s Prime Day sale, which is traditionally one of the online retailer’s busiest weeks of the year. It has kicked off an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Amazon Labor Union President Chris Smalls, who rallied a company warehouse on Staten Island to a union victory earlier this year, tweeted Thursday that the worker had been “unconscious on the floor for over 20 minutes” and that it was “nearly an hour” before 911 was called. He also said the man warned management he was experiencing chest pains but they refused to let him let him take break despite “heated conditions.” Smalls, who didn’t return messages, called the incident “disturbing” and also tweeted that he will be filing “a complaint with the local OSHA” and that his union “will be organizing EWR9.” Amazon spokesman told NBC News in a statement that the death “was related to a personal medical condition.” The company is investigating the incident, but has yet to reveal findings.
