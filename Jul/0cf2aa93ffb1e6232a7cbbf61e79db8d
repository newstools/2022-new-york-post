Lisa Wilson isn’t mincing words about the internet collectively channeling Sherlock Holmes in the wake of son Zach Wilson’s apparent dating drama. On Friday, the Wilson family matriarch posted a video of herself and a gal pal, telling fans to cease any speculation amid recent rumors that the Jets quarterback was allegedly involved with one of her friends. “This is my cute friend, Suzette,” Lisa began, per SideAction.com. “The people questioning… no. Shut up… I have good friends, you guys are idiots.” Wilson, 22, found himself at the center of wild claims earlier this month after his ex-girlfriend, Abbey Gile, was linked to his former BYU teammate, Dax Milne, who is a wide receiver for the Washington Commanders. Gile, who had dated Wilson for several years, was called a “homie hoper” by an Instagram user following the reports about her and Milne, 23. A short time later, an Instagram handle that featured Gile’s name replied, “He was sleeping with his moms best friend… that’s the real homie hopper.” Gile’s Instagram account has since been scrubbed, and the comments have not been verified. As for Wilson, who is gearing up for his sophomore season with the Jets, he appeared to address the recent headlines in an Instagram post on Wednesday. “Took the boys to @gozzerranchclub in Idaho before camp! Poor cell service…what I miss?” Wilson wrote in the caption. Prior to Wilson breaking his silence, Jets fans bombarded the social media pages of his rumored new gal pal, New Jersey-based influencer Nicolette Dellanno. Wilson was first linked to Dellanno in June when the twosome made an appearance at a Yankees game.
