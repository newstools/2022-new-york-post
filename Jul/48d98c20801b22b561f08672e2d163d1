The Astros are plucking from Monmouth to find their pitchers of tomorrow. The organization known for finding and maximizing pitchers used its fourth-round pick on Hawks lefty Trey Dombroski, who will try to become the sixth Monmouth player to reach the majors. “Houston!! Let’s roll baby!! Here we go,” Dombroski tweeted Monday afternoon. The 21-year-old from Manasquan, N.J., is coming off a MAAC season in which he struck out 120 and walked just 14 in 95 innings with a 3.13 ERA. Dombroski, with a fastball that lives around 91 mph, stands out during an era in which breaking radar guns is valued so highly. “I take a different approach to pitching than most guys,” Dombroski told The Post’s Jared Greenspan recently. “A lot of guys like to grip it and rip it. All hard fastballs, hard sliders. For me, it’s the ability to take something off. You just lean on yourself and trust what you’re good at.” He relies on a slider — his best pitch — with a curveball and changeup also in an arsenal that Houston apparently values. The 6-foot-5, 235-pound Dombroski had not been drafted out of Wall High School in 2019 despite going 11-1 with a 0.27 ERA as a senior.
