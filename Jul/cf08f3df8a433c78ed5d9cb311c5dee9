Famed fashion label Christian Dior is haute under the collar over a couture show near its Rome boutique by rival Valentino that allegedly blocked would-be customers from entering its store. As throngs of onlookers and A-listers — including Anne Hathaway, Kate Hudson, Andrew Garfield and Naomi Campbell — gathered in front of the landmark Spanish Steps on July 8 to watch the Valentino couture show, the nearby Dior boutique “remained empty,”  according to a Women’s Wear Daily report citing a letter that Christian Dior Italia fired off to the Milan-based fashion company. Customers were “refused access and blocked at the barriers” from leaving the Spanish Steps area, according to the report. Dior is demanding 100,000 euros within 15 days – or just over $100,000 — for its lost business. The designer threatened to “adopt all the necessary measures to protect its rights” if Valentino doesn’t pay up, according to the report. The French boutique was unable to “operate from the early hours of the afternoon” on Friday, which ordinarily would be a significant shopping day, according to the report. Christian Dior did not immediately respond for comment, nor did Valentino. In the weeks leading up to the show, Valentino had sought permits and promised officials that the extravaganza would not disrupt regular foot traffic in the area. The show sparked another controversy when “Don’t Worry Darling” actress Florence Pugh drew sneers for wearing a sheer pink Valentino gown that exposed her nipples. “It isn’t the first time and certainly won’t be the last time a woman will hear what’s wrong with her body by a crowd of strangers, what’s worrying is just how vulgar some of you men can be,” the Academy Award-nominated actress said in a statement on her Instagram account.
