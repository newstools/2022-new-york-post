Before we move on, a special thank you to the Reds. Took a lot of heat in the inbox for picking an inferior team against Gerrit Cole. The Yanks were 49-0 (!) leading after eight innings before Cincy snapped the streak. Christmas in July, Stitch Nation! The Pirates are in Miami and I haven’t been this excited since NBC decided to air “Ellen” reruns through the summer.   Pittsburgh’s Zach Thompson (3-6, 4.38) has allowed exactly two runs in each of his last four starts, pitching no more than five innings. The Marlins’ Braxton Garrett (1-3, 4.33) has given up four runs in his last 13 innings. The Bucs have played better of late, taking a four-game winning streak into Wednesday night. Play 10 units on the Pirates. More ninth-inning magic! Jose Miranda hit a three-run homer off Josh Hader and the Twinkies bruised the Brewers 4-1. Hey, I can’t believe it either. Latest victory takes us to +1,883 joemauers.
