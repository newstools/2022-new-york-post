We say: Sorry, Madam Veep, but your “whopping” 69-cent drop pales in comparison to the $2.65 spike in gas prices — from $2.46 a gallon to $5.11 last month — since you and President Joe Biden took office. In fact, your team has overseen the fastest such surge ever recorded in all of US history. And your piddling drop only brings the price 26% of the way back down.This is what you’re bragging about? We say: Bryce Covert blames racism for opposition to new welfare programs, i.e., what she calls “nice things” (as if trapping people in lives of dependency is a “nice thing”). Since minorities disproportionately benefit from government aid, she reasons, anyone who opposes such aid must be racist. Please: People can disagree with the wisdom of these programs — and object to their hefty cost — without harboring animosity toward minorities. Then again, what doesn’t the Gray Lady blame on racism? We say: John Berman thinks Fed boss Jerome Powell might be glad that economic growth was negative for the second straight quarter. Huh? Does Powell work for Russia or China or some other US rival? Why would anyone think negative growth is a good thing? Yes, a cooling economy might help temper inflation — but with a painful cost: recession. And by the way, the stagflation of the ’70s proved that low growth and soaring prices can sock the nation simultaneously, with no upside at all. We say: Hmm . . . Imagine if someone wrote about “disappearing” black baby dolls from his home. We say: Only a privileged (and clueless) Democrat like Rep. Eric Swalwell would think the current $4.28-a-gallon price for gas is “so low.” Sheesh! Some Dems make Marie Antoinette look compassionate. — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board
