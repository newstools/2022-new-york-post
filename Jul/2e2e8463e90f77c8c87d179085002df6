A lifelong Harry Potter fan has been seen as Hermione Granger’s doppelgänger since she was a toddler. Ellie Rowe, 10, has been compared to the fictional character played by Emma Watson for as long as she can remember. Her mother Rochelle Rowe, 28, was told her daughter looked like Granger at her wedding, back when Ellie was 3. “At our wedding, my mother-in-law came up to me and said Ellie looked like Hermione,” Rochelle, a trainee nurse from Cornwall in the UK, told SWNS. “I hadn’t noticed until that moment, but then I thought ‘actually she does quite!’ ” Rochelle said as Ellie started to grow up, she started to look “more and more like her every day.” Ellie began to embrace her likeness to the character and would dress up as Hermione regularly. “When Ellie dressed up in the outfit at around 6 or 7 years old it was quite bizarre as really she looked like Hermione’s double,” her mom said. As Ellie has gotten older, her features have slightly outgrown those parallel to Granger’s, but there’s definitely still a strong resemblance. “I have loved Harry Potter since I can remember and when people started to tell me that I looked like Hermione Granger it was so exciting,” Ellie shared. “I even started to feel like I had magical powers and wanted to go to Hogwarts. I read the books with my mum first and then we watched the films,” she added. “I absolutely loved them at the time and I still do today!”
