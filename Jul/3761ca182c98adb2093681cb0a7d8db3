Aaron Judge, who hit a walk off home run in the Yankees’ 1-0 win over the Royals Thursday night at the Stadium, has started 51 of the Yankees’ first 100 games this season in center field, including nearly on an everyday basis over the last two months. That is expected to change, according to Aaron Boone, who said he envisioned Judge “being a little bit more in right field” over the final two-plus months of the season. Judge has handled center field well, in the midst of an MVP campaign, though the position puts an extra burden on his 6-foot-7, 282-pound frame. He missed a game in Boston this month with calf soreness and has also received occasional rest days to make sure he stays healthy. “By and large, I think as healthy as he’s been … I think that’s been the case this year, especially as much as he’s played center field,” Boone said. “I don’t want to overreact to that, but I also want to be smart as we go into the final couple months.” The acquisition of Andrew Benintendi, who will play regularly in left field, frees up Aaron Hicks, who had shifted to left, to get back to playing more in center field. Giancarlo Stanton is also expected to play some right field when he returns from the injured list. Thursday marked Day 14 of no throwing for Luis Severino, who is on the 15-day IL with a low-grade right lat strain. Boone said the Yankees could make an evaluation by Friday regarding whether Severino is in a position to begin throwing. “I know he’s doing pretty well,” Boone said. To make room for Benintendi on the 26-man roster, the Yankees optioned outfielder Tim Locastro to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
