Have you ever wondered what song the person sitting next to you is listening to? This TikTok trend sheds light on what’s bumping in the ears of strangers. The ‘What song are you listening to?’ TikTok trend began in 2021. TikTok user, Shan Rizwan, started interviewing strangers on the street and asking about their music preferences. Rizwan films the vast majority of his videos in New York and continues to interview people when he’s on the road. Rizwan has become a leader in street interviewing and has prompted other TikTok creators to film similar content. TikTok users are even making parodies of Rizwan’s videos. Shan Rizwan is 19 years of age and from East Hanover, New Jersey. He is a filmmaker and photographer. Rizwan is a sophomore at Boston College, where he studies Economics and Marketing. He has over 150,000 followers on YouTube and over 1.3 million followers on TikTok. Since Rizwan’s rise to fame back in 2021, he has created a variety of fast-paced interview question videos. He has even created a series where he goes around Manhattan guessing people’s jobs and rent prices. Several of Rizwan’s YouTube videos show what happens behind the scenes while he is filming. This provides his audience with a firsthand perspective of just how difficult it can be to navigate the streets of New York.
