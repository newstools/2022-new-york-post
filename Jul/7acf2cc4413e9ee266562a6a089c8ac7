Time-lapse video of the Manhattan skyline captured the moment a boat capsized in the Hudson River, fatally trapping a 7-year-old boy and 50-year-old woman underneath. The video, posted to Twitter by NYC Timescape, shows two vessels side by side jetting through the Hudson River and jumping waves around 2:40 p.m. Tuesday before the boat suddenly capsizes, producing a large splash. Investigators believe the boat capsized after it hit a wake from a passing ferry but a spokesperson for NY Waterways denied that was the cause. They said the closest ferry was four minutes away from the doomed vessel and was not close enough to produce a wake. At least 12 people were on board the Yamaha AR240, dubbed Stimulus Money, on a private charter with family and friends when the boat flipped over. The boat’s owner had been following the vessel on a jet ski. Seconds after the boat capsized, the personal watercraft is seen in the video stopping and turning around to assess the damage. A high-ranking police source said the boat appeared to be overloaded, but the exact cause of the accident is still under investigation. Julian Vasquez, 7, and Lindelia Vasquez, 50, were both killed and another three passengers were left in critical condition.
