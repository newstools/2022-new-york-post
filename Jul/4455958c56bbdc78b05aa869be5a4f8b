Gunfire erupted outside the Dior Boutique in the swanky Manhattan neighborhood of Soho on Monday — wounding the boyfriend of an NYPD employee, law-enforcement sources told The Post. The 27-year-old victim was sitting in a gray Honda sedan in front of the high-end Dior New York Soho shop at 105 Greene St. when the drive-by shooting took place around 5 p.m., sources said. The shooter fired from inside a white BMW with New Jersey license plates that pulled up alongside the Toyota, sources said. The victim was shot in the right underarm and rushed to a nearby hospital by his girlfriend, sources said. The girlfriend is a civilian employee of the NYPD and is on extended leave, the Police Department said. A rep wouldn’t say why the woman is on leave. More than a dozen tourists gathered around the crime scene afterward to gawk and shoot photos and videos. The victim’s life isn’t believed to be in danger, sources said.
