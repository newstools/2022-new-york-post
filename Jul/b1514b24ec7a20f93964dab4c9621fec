Cameron Smith got the Claret Jug and the girl. On Sunday, the 28-year-old Australian golfer won his first major after holding off Cameron Young and Rory McIlroy in the 2022 British Open. Though it remains to be seen what Smith’s celebrations will entail, it’s possible he’ll be joined by his rumored girlfriend, Shanel Naoum. Naoum is said to be a resident of Jacksonville, where Smith has a $2.4 million mansion. The twosome is also believed to have met in the Floridian city, according to Golf Monthly. Naoum, whose social media appears to be private, is a chiropractic physician and went to the University of North Florida and the Palmer College of Chiropractic, according to reports. She is believed to have been with Smith and his loved ones in March after he won The Players Championship. Smith, the world No. 6, is quiet about his personal life and has yet to make his relationship with Naoum public. Prior to his apparent romance with Naoum, Smith dated fellow golfer Jordan Ontiveros, who played on the Symetra Tour. The exes, who appeared to live together in Jacksonville when they dated, would occasionally practice together on the course at the nearby TPC Sawgrass. Smith and Ontiveros are believed to have started dating in 2016 though it’s unclear when they broke up.
