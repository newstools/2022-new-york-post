Observations from Thursday’s Jets training session. The pass rush was on fire on Thursday. Several players got to Zach Wilson and would have sacked the quarterback if tackling were permitted. Bryce Huff, John Franklin-Myers, Jacob Martin and Vinny Curry were all in the backfield frequently. The flip side of the pass rush being good is the pass protection was not. The offensive line struggled through the practice. Mekhi Becton looked gassed, and there was not much fight put up by the O-line. Rookie RB Breece Hall has a smooth running style and is an effective receiver. We’ll know more when the pads come on Monday, but Hall has shown flashes early in camp of what made him a coveted pick by the Jets. LT George Fant and WR Braxton Berrios did not participate in team drills. Coach Robert Saleh was vague about what is bothering them. Fant had offseason knee surgery and did not practice in the spring, so the team may be easing him back in. Berrios was wearing a sleeve on his left leg. Both players participated in the other portions of practice but sat out team drills.
