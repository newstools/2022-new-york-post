Mike Tyson believes at times that his fate is imminent. On his podcast, “Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson,” the former heavyweight boxing champ had therapist Sean McFarland, who specializes in trauma and addiction, on as a guest and told him he feels he’s inching closer to death. “We’re all gonna die one day of course,” Tyson said. “Then, when I look in the mirror, I see those little spots on my face, I say, ‘Wow. That means my expiration date is coming close, really soon.'” The 56-year-old Tyson has become very philosophical and introspective, and before addressing his mortality he spoke about how money does not bring the happiness and security that those who have never had it might suspect. “Money don’t mean s–t to me,” Tyson said. “I always tell people — they think money’s gonna make them happy, they’ve never had money before — when you have a lot of money, you can’t expect nobody to love you. How am I gonna confess my love to you when you have $500 billion? “The false sense of security. You believe nothing can happen. You don’t believe the banks could collapse. You believe that you’re invincible when you have a lot of money, which isn’t true. That’s why I always say money is a false sense of security.” Tyson said he has conversations with his wife, where she says she wants money for security. “What is security?” he asked. “I don’t know. When you put money in your bank and you get a check every week and you can live for the rest of your life, is that security? That means you won’t catch a disease, you can’t get hit by a car? You can’t jump off a bridge. I don’t know. Is that security? Can money secure you from that?”
