Coffee shop workers sometimes take to social media to brutally drag customers for their complicated Starbucks orders or rude behavior, but one barista is causing a stir for a different reason — declaring it to be “low key the sluttiest job.” “We flirt with everyone,” user Josh Salad wrote in overlay text on a now-viral TikTok. “Customers have a crush on me because I am cute to them to get tips.” It may seem like a huge claim, but Salad backs it up with why he believes baristas are, in fact, the sluttiest of workers. “How can’t you fall in love with us when we give you warm drinks in cute cups,” he hypothesizes in the clip that’s been viewed 1.3 million times as of Thursday afternoon. “I’ll flirt with you and your dad at the same time,” he continues. “My co-worker turned a 30-year-old straight woman last week. We slutty as heck and it’s on purpose.” Followers found the declaration hilarious, but many caffeine addicts are now left questioning the relationship they have with their café crushes. “Thought he was in love with me,” one user commented in dismay. “Never sending my man into a coffee shop again,” wrote another, with Salad cheekily replying: “he’s my man now.” “Baristas are romanticized bar tenders,” another TikToker wrote. “As a former barista, this is absolutely true,” confirmed someone else, with another adding: “I make 16.50 cause of tips I can concur.” Others simply want their caffeine fix, then leave. “I don’t really get that … I just take my drink and leave,” one user commented, “Cool, I can’t deal with any of that till I have coffee,” agreed another.
