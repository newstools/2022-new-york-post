Ivana Trump died when she accidentally fell down the stairs of her Manhattan home — where a maintenance man found her body next to a cup of spilled coffee, officials and law-enforcement sources said Friday. A personal aide and a cleaning lady had come to the 73-year-old Trump’s Upper East Side home Thursday and rang the bell and called her phone to get in, but no one answered, sources said. The pair called the building’s super, but he couldn’t open the door because it was double-locked from the inside, sources said. Finally, a maintenance worker was called to the scene, got the door open — and found Trump at the floor of the stairs with the cup of java spilled next to her, sources said. The ex-wife of former President Donald Trump suffered “blunt impact injuries” to her torso, the New York City Medical Examiner’s Office said. Her death was officially ruled an “accident’’ by the ME’s office. The socialite businesswoman had been suffering hip pain and had such trouble walking that she couldn’t even leave her house for a quick jaunt to the Hamptons, a close friend told The Post on Friday. She also was so unsteady on her feet at times that she needed a personal health aide to help walk around her neighborhood, other friends said.
