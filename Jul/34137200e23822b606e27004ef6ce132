Competitive eating is back in Brooklyn for the Fourth of July — as champ Joey Chestnut seeks to finish off the field at Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. Chestnut, better known as “Jaws,” finished off a record 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes at last year’s relocated contest in Maimonides Park stadium, taking home his 14th “Mustard Belt” title. Coverage of the Independence Day tradition kicks off at 10:45 a.m. Monday on ESPN3 and ESPNews with the women’s competition — as thousands are expected to return to the contest’s original location at the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues and relish the eaters scarfing down the dogs. ESPN’s John Anderson will handle play-by-play coverage for both events, with analysis from Major League Eating’s Richard Shea. The 38-year-old Chestnut, known as the undisputed champ of the event, will look to defend his 14 titles on crutches, as he heals from a ruptured tendon. The men’s event is slated to begin at noon. “It’s all right,” he said Friday. “I’ll be able to stand up and eat. I’m excited … I’m not eating with my leg.” Meanwhile, last year’s women’s champ, Michelle Lesco, 38, is seeking to defend her crown after winning her first title in 2021 — when she put away 30.75 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. However, the world’s No. 1 ranked female competitive eater, Miki Sudo, is returning this year after missing last year’s competition because she was pregnant. Sudo’s personal best is an impressive 48 hot dogs. “I’m so excited to be back,” Sudo, who won seven straight titles from 2014 to 2021, said Friday. Weather is also supposed to cooperate at one of New York’s signature events – with partly cloudy skies in the upper 70s as Chestnut and Lesco seek to defend their titles.
