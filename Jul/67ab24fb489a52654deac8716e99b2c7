Ivana Trump was found dead at the bottom of a staircase at her Upper East Side townhouse on Thursday — and police are investigating if she fell down the flight of steps before her death, sources said. Authorities also believe that Trump, the ex-wife of former President Donald Trump, suffered from cardiac arrest, but her official cause of death will be determined by a medical examiner. Officers discovered the 73-year-old’s body at about 12:40 p.m. after being called to her home for a wellness check, cops said. Ivana Trump was set to leave New York for St. Tropez, France Friday in what would have been her first trip since the COVID-19 pandemic, her best friend told Page Six. “She was afraid of getting the virus,” a distraught Nikki Haskel said. A source told The Post that Ivana Trump’s “health has been in decline over the past few years,” but it was unclear if she had been suffering from any specific condition. The Czech-American skier-turned-model and businesswoman married the former president in 1977 and is the mother of his first three children; Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. She held many roles in the Trump family businesses throughout her life. The 80s power couple divorced in 1992.
