This week’s LIV Golf event just outside of Portland, Ore., turned into a family affair for Paulina Gretzky and husband Dustin Johnson. On Thursday, the newlywed, 33, posted a photo of herself behind the wheel of a golf cart on her Instagram Stories, tagging brothers Trevor and Tristan in the snap, as they watched Johnson, 37, tee it up at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club, where the Saudi-backed golf league hosted its first event on US soil. Johnson, who resigned from the PGA Tour last month in favor of its controversial rival, was seen on the course alongside his brother and caddie, Austin Johnson, in posts shared by Austin’s wife, Samantha Maddox. Maddox, who married Austin in 2018, also posted a selfie from Pumpkin Ridge as she modeled a black mini dress. The tournament officially got underway on Thursday with Carlos Ortiz leading the pack after shooting 5-under for 67. Johnson is currently in second place a shot back. The 48-man field is competing for a $20 million purse, along with an extra $5 million prize pool for the team competition. Thursday’s event wasn’t without controversy, however, as family members and survivors of the Sept. 11 attacks traveled to Portland to protest LIV Golf, which is funded by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Johnson, who reportedly received $125 million to defect to LIV Golf, told reporters in June that he “chose what’s best” for his family. “I’ve done well on the PGA Tour, very thankful for what they’ve given me too. I don’t want to play golf for the rest of my life, as I probably would’ve had to do,” Johnson said. “This is something new. I like to do a lot of other things besides golf. I get to spend a lot more time with my family and doing the things I love to do.” Johnson married Gretzky in a lavish Tennessee wedding this past April after getting engaged in 2013. They share two sons, Tatum, 7, and River, 5.
