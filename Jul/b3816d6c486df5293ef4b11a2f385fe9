These two dogs have tied the leash! The yappy couple met while going on leisurely strolls. Two chihuahuas, 8-year-old Chester and 1-year-old Izzy, got married with a garden-themed ceremony and surrounded by their loved ones, including their owners and more than 90 dogs. “Chester fell deeply in love with Izzy from the local walks that we do,” his owner Mandy Willow told CheshireLive. “Chester goes absolutely mad for her, screaming for her and meets her at the car.” Izzy’s owner, Stephanie Rice, came up with the idea for an actual wedding, which was to help raise money for the Cheshire Sighthound Rescue. “A lot of the money we’re raising for the sighthound charity,” Rice said. “We’ve done a lot of themed events raising money: We’ve done RSPCA, the Manchester and Cheshire dogs home.” Willow added that they do several different charity events, including “Santa Paws” at Christmas. “So, we do different things and each time it’s going to be for a different dog charity,” she said. The couple went all out by exchanging rings, sausages and vows. The pooches promised to, “always play together; to care for their puppies, be their one or one-hundred-and-one; to share their favorite toys; to protect their houses from the evil mailman and to only sniff each other’s butts from now until forever,” according to CheshireLive. The officiant was an 18-month old greyhound named Stan who was assisted by “professional celebrant” Rebecca Knapper. “I’ve never done a dog wedding before,” she told CheshireLive. “I want to do this all the time now.” She mentioned, “I spent a fortnight getting in as many dog puns as I could.” They were held by their “parents” to assist them in cutting their eight-tier and dog-friendly cake before being placed in a stroller attached with tin cans as they rode off with their tongues flapping in the wind.
