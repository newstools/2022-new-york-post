At least 9 people, including a teenager, were struck by gunfire during a drive-by shooting in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday night, officials said. The victims were outside of a bodega on the corner of Shepherd Avenue and Clinton Place at about 6:20 p.m. when a fusillade of bullets were fired in their direction, according to Newark law enforcement. Four adults and a 17-year-old transported themselves to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Four other adults were taken by EMS to University Hospital. All nine victims are being treated for gunshot wounds and are in stable condition, Newark Acting Public Safety Director Raul Malave said. A “vehicle of interest” has been identified by police in connection to the mass shooting — a white Honda Pilot that was stolen from Jersey City, he said. It’s unclear what led to the shooting or how many shooters were involved. Police are canvassing the area for surveillance footage. No additional information was immediately available. Thursday’s violence in Newark was the 19th mass shooting across the country since June 20, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a national database that tracks shootings in the US. In those shootings, 12 people have been killed and 90 wounded. Several of those mass shootings occurred in New York City. Last Monday, eight people were wounded and a college basketball star was killed when gunfire erupted in Harlem. On Saturday night, four people were wounded, including an 8-year-old boy, in another mass shooting in which two suspects opened fire at an outdoor gathering in Brooklyn, cops said. In another night of violence overnight Tuesday, at least six people — including two teens — were shot in a series of incidents across The Big Apple, according to police. Overnight Wednesday, at least three people were shot in the city. Among the victims was a young mother who was gunned down while pushing her 3-month old baby in a stroller on the Upper East Side.
