The dirty mind is in the eye of the beholder — according to one picture. A photo posted to Reddit has confused some viewers, who couldn’t work out what, exactly, they were looking at. [Warning: Spoilers below] “Had to do a triple-take while perusing the reviews on Target,” the caption reads. “Thought she was really letting it all out.” The picture shows a woman posing in profile while wearing a pink tank top and black denim shorts. She has her right arm down by her side, facing the camera, but her left arm is bent, with her elbow at chest height and her hand near her face. Although it seems like a perfectly innocent image, some users may have felt like boobs because were distracted by the woman’s elbow, with some thinking it was a different body part. “Professional photography and staging can be expensive. They’re doing their breast,” a Redditer laughed. “Please stop with all these tasteless jokes. Let’s nipple this in the bud,” offered another, while another word wizard quipped, “We’ll always treasure the mammaries of this thread.” Of course, this isn’t the first time viewers have been thrown off by saucy illusions. Italian body-painter Johannes Stötter recently fooled fans when he challenged them to spot a naked woman in an image of a gorgeous flower. Meanwhile, Swiss artist Sandro del-Prete offered a sexy optical illusion in a simple black-and-white drawing from 1987. And in a more blatant example, people were scandalized by this simple drawing that could be viewed in one of two ways — with the most popular version being most certainly NSFW.
