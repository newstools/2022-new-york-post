A surfer was bitten by a shark at on Long Island on Wednesday morning in the second attack this month at the popular beach destination. The surfer was on his board at Smith Point Beach on Fire Island when a 4-foot tiger shark took a bite out of his leg at around 7:30 a.m., according to officials. Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said during a press conference that the 4-foot tiger shark left a 4-inch gash in the surfer’s leg. “This individual was knocked off the paddle board — they were on a paddle board, was knocked off the paddle board, took a punch at the shark,” Bellone said detailing the incident. “[The surfer] saw the shark coming back around toward him after that initial bite occurred and then at that moment, fortunately, a wave hit that carried the surfer and the paddle board into shore and that was the last contact with the shark.” The victim, a 41-year-old man, sought care from a park ranger before an ambulance brought the victim to a local hospital, WABC reported. The popular summer spot was closed off to swimming for a few hours as the second shark attack in 10 days at Smith Point struck fear into the hearts of beachgoers. Earlier this month, a lifeguard was playing a victim in an ocean training exercise at the Suffolk beach when he was attacked. “To have two of these incidents happen for us, for this facility, for this beach is unprecedented,” Bellone said. “We’ve not seen this before.” Bellone said swimming has not been closed off at Smith Point since it opened in 1959.  He cautioned more frequent attacks with tiger sharks could become a “new normal” because that type of shark is closer to shore now. Lifeguards would continue to monitor for nearby sharks, including using a drone to track them. “This is an issue of incredible importance to all of us here in Suffolk County,” Bellone said.
