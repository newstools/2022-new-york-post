Four men were hurt in separate shootings across the Big Apple overnight, authorities said. A 47-year-old man was blasted in the left arm during a dispute on Merrick Boulevard near 224th Street in Laurelton, Queens around 2:20 a.m. Friday, cops said. The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. About an hour earlier, a 20-year-old man was shot in the back by a drive-by shooter on Decatur Avenue near East 193rd Street in the Fordham Manor section of the Bronx, cops said. The victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital and is expected to survive. The suspect fled in a black Subaru, cops said. Late Thursday night, a man was blasted in the chest when two men tried to swipe his gold chain on Newkirk Avenue near East 26th Street in Flatbush around 11:15 p.m., police said. He was taken to the Kings County Hospital Center in stable condition, cops said. The two suspects fled in a gray four-door sedan, police said. In East New York, a 35-year-old man was sitting in the back seat of a parked car at Drew Street and Pitkin Avenue just after 10 p.m. when a man wearing all black walked up to the vehicle and fired into it, cops said. The victim, who was struck in the right leg, was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. The violence comes days after a bloody Fourth of July weekend that saw 51 people shot, seven of them fatally, in 36 incidents across New York City. Meanwhile, shootings were down by 24.2 percent in June, compared to that month in 2021, according to NYPD statistics.
