As anticipation heats up for the “Game of Thrones” prequel “House of the Dragon,” creator George R.R. Martin explained why women have a hard time grabbing power in Westeros. “I get inspiration from history, and then I take elements from history and I turn it up to 11,” the fantasy author said at a Comic-Con panel in San Diego on Saturday, according to Entertainment Weekly. “I don’t think Westeros is particularly more anti-woman or more misogynistic than real life and what we call history,” he continued. “Games of Thrones” has been hit with criticism of sexism over its portrayal of women and sex scenes, including when Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) raped Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner). Some viewers are concerned about something similar happening in the new series “House of the Dragon,” which although does have less sex, the main plot point is a civil war with the goal in stopping Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen from leading the country. The prequel is set to premiere on both HBO and HBO Max on August 21. “‘Game of Thrones’ is, as many people have observed, based very loosely on the War of the Roses. [House of the Dragon] is based on an earlier period in history called the Anarchy,” Martin said. The Anarchy refers to a civil war in England and Normandy that started when King Henry I left his daughter, Empress Matilda, to claim the throne. Actress Emilia Clarke — who recently confirmed another spinoff series starring Kit Harington as Jon Snow — has also spoken out about the show being labeled sexist. “It pains me to hear people taking ‘Thrones’ out of context with anti-feminist spin — because you can’t do that about this show,” she told Entertainment Weekly in 2016. “It shows the range that happens to women, and ultimately shows women are not only equal but have a lot of strength.”
