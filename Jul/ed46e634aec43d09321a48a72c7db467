Gen Z and Boomers may be generations apart, but they both agree that they should keep their items for a good amount of time — and that includes cars. According to a new survey by Ally Financial and OnePoll, seven in 10 of the 2,000 repondents in the 18-40 age group said their cars should last seven years or longer. In addition, 56 percent of participants still drive their first car, and 59 percent said they would rather buy a used car than a new one. Seventy-one percent of the 18-40 age group also prefers used cars. That group cites sustainability (63 percent) and ease of driving (63 percent), and affordability (46 percent) as key factors for their preference. But the respondents were divided on which cars were more eco-friendly. Thirty-two percent believe newer cars with the latest emissions and control technology are better. Meanwhile, 52 percent think keeping their old car instead of using resources to build a new one better helps the environment. When it comes to shopping for a new car, each generation has its own priorities. Nearly half of the younger generation wants a model that’s eco-friendly while 57 and older participants seek out reliability and less maintenance. While older drivers see electronic vehicles as the future, only 28 percent would consider buying one. Meanwhile, 72 percent of respondents aged 18-40 would consider an EV. Four in five (82%) of younger drivers also believe electric vehicles are the future — 72% of those aged 18-40 would consider purchasing one. In comparison, only 28% of drivers aged 57 and older would consider ever purchasing an electrified vehicle even though the majority (51%) still see EVs as the future.
