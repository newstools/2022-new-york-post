New videos show Jason Momoa walking away unscathed in the immediate aftermath of a head-on motorcycle crash Sunday near Los Angeles. The “Aquaman” hunk, 42, was driving his beloved 1970 Oldsmobile along a winding road in Calabasas around 11 a.m. when a motorcyclist purportedly jumped traffic lanes and collided with the actor’s vintage vehicle. The motorcyclist, identified as 21-year-old Vitaliy Avagimyan, was thrown from his bike and flipped over the hood of Momoa’s car. The DC action star subsequently stopped his vehicle and rushed to administer aid to Avagimyan. He was then able to flag down another passing motorist and told them to call 911. Avagimyan was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for “minor, non-life-threatening injuries,” according to CBS News. On Monday, footage of the accident’s aftermath was obtained by TMZ, showing Momoa at the scene of the collision. The video appears to have been taken after an ambulance had escorted Avagimyan to hospital. It appears members of the California Highway Patrol had also come and gone from the scene. According to a CHP spokesperson, Momoa remained at the crash site to assist them for the duration of their investigation.
