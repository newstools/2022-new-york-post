Wedding guests and TikTok users were left speechless by a risky wedding proposal — after a woman was proposed to during her daughter’s wedding. TikTok user Chloe Robinson posted a now-viral video, showing the moment she faked throwing her bouquet and instead ran down the stairs and handed it to her mother. Her partner then came out and popped the big question, getting down on one knee and holding out a ring in front of a gobsmacked crowd. “Dear Mum, it’s your time now,” she wrote in the comment on the video, which has been viewed over 1.2 million times. Although it’s normally a faux pas to get engaged on someone else’s big day, the sweet proposal has users “holding back tears” with the bride sharing why she wanted her mom to share her big day. “She gave me away so I wanted her to match me,” Robinson said in a comment, with users praising the selfless newlywed. The bouquet toss at a wedding is often seen as a symbol of good luck, with whoever catches the bouquet supposedly being the “next” to walk down the aisle. “What a beautiful way to be able to say ‘thanks Mum for all you have done and by my side,’ so sweet,” a user gushed. “What wonderful memories for the whole family … teaching the kids a valuable lesson about sharing joy,” another said.
