John Daly doesn’t stay down for long. Although he missed the cut at the British Open, finishing at 3-over after two days for his second missed cut at a major this year, the 56-year-old was back out on the golf course on Saturday, playing a round with the Manning family. Having won the British Open in 1995 and the PGA Championship in 1991, Daly is exempt into both, despite recent struggles that included him withdrawing from the Bridgestone Senior Players Championship last week and being disqualified from the Regions Tradition earlier this year for failing to sign his scorecard. The eccentric former major champion tweeted a photo of the group, which included Peyton, Eli and Cooper Manning, along with singer Eric Church. They played at Kingsbarns Golf Links, about eight miles down the road from the Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, where the 150th edition of the British Open is being played this week. There were no details on the round and who won, but it’s clear that Daly isn’t beating himself up over the missed cut. It’s also been an eventful summer for the Mannings, with Cooper’s son, Arch, committing to play football at Texas and Peyton involved in rumors surrounding the new Broncos ownership group. That, presumably, was far from their minds on Saturday, though.
