Saweetie brought out her silver and blue diamonds to throw the first pitch in Thursday’s Dodgers game. The Grammy-nominated rapper — who is from Santa Clara in the Bay Area — took the mound while rocking diamond rings, bracelets, and necklaces that matched her custom team jersey which featured her name on the back. Saweetie threw a pretty good pitch for having inches-long nails that were decorated in bedazzled jewels. She also kicked her left leg up in a pitching stance while balancing in sky-high Christian Louboutin heels. Saweetie threw out the first pitch during the Dodgers’ Filipino Heritage Night, in which Los Angeles defeated the Cubs, 5-3. Her mother is of Filipina and Chinese descent. The Dodgers’ Instagram account shared photos and videos of Saweetie’s first pitch, including a snap of the rapper with right-fielder Mookie Betts. “ICY.  Thanks for stopping by, @saweetie!” the Dodgers wrote on Instagram, appearing to reference her debut single, “Icy Grl.” Saweetie then replied, “Can’t wait to come back!!!!” The “Closer” rapper, 29, also filmed her pitching experience in a number of posts on her Instagram Story, stating that Dodgers Stadium has a “special place in my [heart].” Saweetie is set to release her debut studio album, “Pretty B—h Music,” sometime in 2022. The Dodgers will host the Cubs this weekend before traveling to St. Louis for a three-game series against the Cardinals.
