President Biden just can’t help himself: Everything has to be about his pet agenda. Even the death of a former world leader on the other side of the globe. The assassination of Japan’s Shinzo Abe — his nation’s longest-serving prime minister — sent shockwaves around the world. For Biden, it was one more opportunity to fire off glib remarks: “Gun violence,” he said in a statement, “always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it.” “Gun violence”? This was an assassination, an act of world-historical terror. And the pablum about “communities affected” misses the sheer scale of the crime. It’s also clearly an effort to add oomph to Biden’s other rhetoric on gun control. Which is largely irrelevant here, as the assassin used a homemade gun in a country that bans guns almost entirely. The death of an admired politician is not time for crass point-scoring. Left-leaning news outfits also took up the cry, with the AP clucking over Japan’s strong gun laws and NPR decrying Abe first as a “divisive arch-conservative” and then as an “ultranationalist” (despite his commitment to improving relations around the region). A man is dead and a nation is in mourning. The left loves to go on about empathy. It should develop some of its own.
