A majority of Americans now say they support term limits or mandatory retirement for Supreme Court justices, as overall confidence in the high court has fallen by 16 points since April, a poll released Monday showed. Instead of serving life terms, 67% of Americans believe justices should have to step down after a specific number of years — that broke down to 82% of Democrats, 57% of Republicans, and 51% of independents, the Associated Press/NORC poll found. And 64% think the justices should have to retire by a specific age, including 75% of Democrats, 56% of Republicans and 54% of independents. The survey, conducted after the Supreme Court on June 24 struck down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case guaranteeing a woman’s right to abortion, found that the number of people who “hardly” have any confidence in the court increased to 43% from 27% in April. T​he April poll — taken before the court’s draft decision on Roe v. Wade was leaked — found that 18% had a great deal of confidence, 54% said they had some, and 27% said they had hardly any. In July’s poll, 17% say they have a great deal of confidence, 39% say only some, and 43% say hardly any. Americans are evenly divided on whether the court should be expanded beyond the nine justices now sitting on the bench — 34% favor, 34% oppose, while 32% neither favor nor oppose. Democrats by 52% back expanding the court, while only 14% of Republicans do and 33% of independents. The poll surveyed 1,085 adults between July 14 and 17. It has a plus/minus 3.9 percentage-point margin of error.
