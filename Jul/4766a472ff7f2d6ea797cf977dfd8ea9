A Texas congresswoman took a bite out of First Lady Jill Biden for her recent gaff about the state’s Hispanic community and tacos by comparing the remarks to how much inflation has increased the cost of the popular dish. GOP representative Mayra Flores grilled Biden by tweeting a saucy meme that focused on how “taco inflation” during the current administration was squeezing people’s wallets. “Tacos inflation — tacos are unique. Ingredients may vary,” said the meme. The image also included facts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that the price of cheese has increased by 8.7% compared to a year ago. In that same time, lettuce is up 11.4%, tortillas cost 12.8% more and carne asada is up a whooping 17.4%. The meme was a dig at FLOTUS Jill Biden who apologized earlier this week after some were offended by comments she made about tacos and Hispanics during a speech in San Antonio. “The first lady apologizes that her words conveyed anything but pure admiration and love for the Latino community,” tweeted Jill Biden’s spokesperson, Michael LaRosa. The First Lady made the comments during a speech Monday in front of Hispanic advocacy groups. “Raul helped build this organization with the understanding that the diversity of this community — as distinct as the bodegas of the Bronx, as beautiful as the blossoms of Miami, and as unique as the breakfast tacos here in San Antonio — is your strength,” Jill Biden said. While speaking with FOX News, Flores was asked about President Joe Biden’s approval numbers among Hispanics. A recent poll showed a majority — 63% disapprove — of the job he’s doing. Flores said the economy and the border crisis are the reasons Biden’s support among Hispanics is tanking. “They’ve taken us for granted the entire time and nothing they do, moving forward, is going to change that.” said Flores. “We’re going to teach them a strong lesson in November, that (Democrats) do not own our vote.”
