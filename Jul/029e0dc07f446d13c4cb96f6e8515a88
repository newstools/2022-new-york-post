A lightning strike killed a soldier and injured nine others stationed at a Georgia Army base Wednesday, according to reports. The wild incident occurred around 11:10 a.m. at Fort Gordon, a spokesperson told WRDW-TV, as thunderstorms were rolling through the area. The fort’s Department of Emergency Services and Emergency Medical Services responded to one of the training areas where the soldiers were located when the lighting hit, the television station reported. One of injured soldiers later died, WJBF reported, citing authorities. The conditions of the nine other soldiers were not immediately known.
