At least four people were shot – one fatally – as gunfire erupted across the city overnight, cops said. An unidentified man in his 30s was shot dead as he sat in the passenger seat of a silver Acura at Grand Concourse and East Tremont Avenue in Mount Hope around 1:30 a.m. Thursday, police said. The male suspect opened fire into the Acura, striking the victim in the face, cops said. The victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The gunman – described as heavyset and wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans – fled after the shooting and no arrests have been made. Hours earlier, around 9:45 p.m. Wednesday, a 19-year-old man was shot in the leg at Stillwell and Surf avenues in Coney Island, cops said. He was taken to NYU Langone Brooklyn Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Two persons of interest were taken into custody, and a gun was recovered. Earlier in the evening, a 22-year-old woman was shot in the back and thigh inside a parking lot on Victory Boulevard near Clove Road in Staten Island’s Sunnyside neighborhood around 8:20 p.m., cops said. Two men pulled up in a silver Infiniti G35 and shots were fired during a dispute, authorities said. Police could not immediately confirm whether the woman – who was taken to Richmond University Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries – was an innocent bystander. Back in the Bronx, a 28-year-old man was blasted in the leg on Bryant Avenue near Seneca Avenue in Hunts Point around 7:30 p.m., cops said. He was standing outside when a gunman opened fire while driving by in a white Honda, police said. He was taken to Lincoln Medical Center, where he was expected to survive.
