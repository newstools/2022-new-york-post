David Jakubonis clearly has serious mental issues, but that’s hardly reason for him to be walking free after his alleged potentially deadly attack on GOP gov candidate Lee Zeldin. Blame New York’s insane no-bail law and the progressive drive to keep everyone out of jail. All accounts say Jakubonis, 43, went after Zeldin (who’s also a sitting member of Congress) with bladed key-chain “ornament” like ones marketed as a self-defense tool. Yet he was released just hours later, after Monroe County DA Sandra Doorley charged him with second-degree attempted assault, which didn’t allow the judge to set bail, let alone order him detained. Here’s the “logic” of Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, Gov. Kathy Hochul et al: Zeldin fought off the attack (with assists from his running mate, ex-NYPD commander Alison Esposito, and Assembly candidate Joe Chennelly) and so didn’t actually get stabbed — so his attacker isn’t dangerous enough to even let a judge consider locking him up. Well, maybe the judge could’ve had the option if Doorley’s office had been tougher, and charged first-degree assault or attempted murder: A lucky hit might have, say, severed his carotid artery. But the prosecutor has embraced the “decarceration” movement: Facing a George Soros-backed progressive challenger in 2019, she declared, “I understand that locking people up does not promote public safety.” Which makes us at least sympathetic to Andy McCarthy’s argument for a federal prosecution of Jakubonis. Again, it’s entirely possible that Jakubonis belongs in a mental institution, not prison. But he shouldn’t be walking loose: All the facts suggest he remains a ticking time bomb. But New York’s government doesn’t favor locking up dangerous crazy people any more than outright thugs. Isn’t it ironic that the best way to change those perverse priorities is to vote for Zeldin?
