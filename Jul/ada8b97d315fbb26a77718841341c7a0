LAS VEGAS — All signs point to the Kevin Durant era coming to an end in Brooklyn. And no matter what trade package Nets general manager Sean Marks gets in return, it won’t be fair value. It won’t be enough. This is going to end up as a catastrophic failure by management, a stinging disappointment from which it may take years to recover. Now the question — presuming Durant and Kyrie Irving eventually get traded — is whether the failure will be historic or just plain horrible. The choices are not great for the Nets. Most teams have reached out to Marks and Nets owner Joe Tsai to offer proposals for Durant, and some have even called back unbidden to increase their offers. But to date, not one has piqued the Nets’ interest. The Nets have let it be known around league circles that they want a package centered around a legitimate All-Star, as well as other quality players and a haul of first-round picks and pick swaps. The return that Jazz boss Danny Ainge — whose savvy longtime Brooklyn fans can attest to, from Ainge’s days running the Celtics — extracted in return for Rudy Gobert has emboldened Marks to seek a monumental return for Durant.
