Harry Styles is in bed — but not getting much sleep — in his new music video. The 28-year-old pop sensation released “Late Night Talking” from his highly popular album “Harry’s House” on Wednesday, featuring him having some fun in the sheets with many different people. The video — directed by Bradley & Pablo, who also directed his “Watermelon Sugar” music video — starts with Styles in bed, waking up alone before crawling through a sheet tunnel to his second location — a massive bed filled with people. The singer drifts off to sleep and wakes up in a bed in an art gallery before he pops in and out of various frames — eating spaghetti, officiating a wedding and a big pillow fight — before his bed takes him through the clouds. The One Direction member teased the clip a few days ago, sending social media into a frenzy. “How does someone apply to be an extra for a Harry Styles video? Asking for myself,” one person tweeted after the video was dropped. “Who do I have to pay off to have a pillow fight with Harry Styles,” another wrote. “Late Night Talking” is the second single from the Style’s third studio album, “Harry’s House,” which dropped in May. He released the video for “As It Was” in April.
