This is the one time you want to find a snake in the forest. Puzzle lovers are straining their eyes trying to solve this illusion, in which the goal is to spot the serpent hiding in a peaceful tree. “Watch out there’s a snake hiding somewhere around,” challenged a YouTube clip of the visual jigsaw, which was posted by the account Bright Side. [Warning: Spoilers Below] Those who can pass this Adam and Eve-esque eye exam are apparently in rarified company: Only the “1% most attentive” are able to locate it within the allotted five seconds, per the clip. On its face, the photo seems to depict a large tree in the jungle and little else. However, the camera then zooms in to reveal that there’s a nondescript brown snake immaculately camouflaged against the tree roots in the lower right-hand corner. The same video also includes other mind-bending illusions, including another retinal test in which viewers have to spot the butterfly among the leaf litter. Optical illusions such as this are often just intended as a lighthearted diversion from the stresses of modern life — but they also hold actual scientific value for medical professionals. These brain teasers are credited with helping researchers shed light on the complex workings of the human mind and how it reacts to its surroundings. Dr. Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at London’s Goldsmiths University, declared to the Sun that illusions are important to our understanding of the brain: “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you.”
