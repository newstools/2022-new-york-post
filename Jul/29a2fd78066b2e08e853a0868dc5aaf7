AJ Dillon is taking no prisoners, even with mascots. The Green Bay Packers running back barreled into the Kenosha Kingfish’s “Elvis” on Saturday, knocking off the summer baseball league mascot’s head post-tackle. Dillon was in Kenosha for a celebrity softball game that rostered former and current Packers such as Jordan Love and Gilbert Brown. In the viral video, the Dillon and “Elvis” jump off the ground, both sprinting toward each other doing a type of Oklahoma Drill. The running back, with a football grasped in his right arm, decked the poor mascot offscreen — and to the ground — in the video. The Kingfish’s Twitter account said the two’s match “ended as expected.” Dillon’s teammate David Bakhtiari also joined in on the fun, tweeting “911. I’d like to report a dead body.” The 24-year-old running back will enter his third season come the fall after rushing 803 yards during his sophomore campaign.
