Jon Rahm has had better moments. Competing in the second round at the Scottish Open on Friday, Rahm badly hooked a shot that thudded into a wall on the course. He proceeded to react in frustration — with the live broadcast capturing every bit of it. Warning: graphic language “Great draw,” Rahm yelled at himself. “Great f–king draw you asshole.” At the time of his outburst, Rahm sat in 13th place at 2-under. “I don’t think he liked it,” the TV commentator quipped afterwards, adding some levity to Rahm’s meltdown.
