Well played, Zach Wilson. The Jets quarterback, 22, appeared to poke fun at the wild rumors regarding his love life on Wednesday in his Instagram return, days after he was accused by ex-girlfriend Abbey Gile of allegedly sleeping with his mom’s best friend. “Took the boys to @gozzerranchclub in Idaho before camp! Poor cell service…what I miss?” Wilson quipped in the post’s caption. For his trip out west, Wilson was joined by Jets teammates Braxton Berrios, Joe Flacco, Garrett Wilson, Trevon Wesco, Jeff Smith, Elijah Moore and CJ Uzomah, who signed a three-year, $24 million deal with the team during free agency in March. Much like rumored gal pal Nicolette Dellanno, who was bombarded with social media comments in the wake of the alleged drama, Jets fans immediately celebrated Wilson’s online return. “That’s my QB,” one fan responded while another replied, “ talk.” Over the weekend, Wilson’s ex-girlfriend, Abbey Gile, was linked to Washington Commanders wide receiver Dax Milne, who happens to be the quarterback’s former BYU teammate. When a social media user called Gile a “homie hopper,” an Instagram account that featured her name in the handle responded, “He was sleeping with his moms best friend… that’s the real homie hopper.” Gile’s Instagram account has since been deleted. Wilson, who is gearing up for his second season in New York, was most recently linked to Dellanno, a social media influencer based in New Jersey. The twosome took in a Yankees game together in June. Wilson was selected second overall by the Jets in 2021.
