The American Broadcasting Company stole an image of a mural for an episode of “The Bachelor,” an artist couple claims in a Manhattan Federal Court lawsuit. Painter Victor Fung and photographer Lisa Beggs claim the show reproduced a photo of their mural “Greetings From Knoxville,” and aired it for a Feb. 2020 episode without their permission. Fung and Beggs left New York City in 2015 and have traveled the country in an RV ever since as Greetings Tour Inc., painting more than 55 murals in 25 states. Fung painted “Greetings From Knoxville” in 2017. ABC swiped an image of the art and superimposed the ABC logo on it for the show, according to the lawsuit. “Greetings Tour is a nationwide mural project creating interactive &timeless landmarks through public art. Using the classic large letterpostcard style, our artwork captures the pride of locals for theirhometowns and sparks the interests of visitors alike,” according to the Greetings Tour web site. The lawsuit against ABC seeks unspecified damages. “Our client’s artwork was used without its permission for commercial benefit by ABC in its programming for ‘The Bachelor.’ Our creators have no choice but to enforce their rights here, and we look forward to protecting our artists’ rights in their work,” said attorney Laura Zaharia, who reps the artists. The network didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.
