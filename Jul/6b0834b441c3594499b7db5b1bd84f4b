Jennifer Aniston shared her condolences — and a GoFundMe page — Thursday for a member of the “The Morning Show” crew who died from injuries in a tragic motorcycle accident. Gunnar Mortensen, 39, served as a camera assistant on the Apple TV+ series and died Monday in Southern California. “This past week we suddenly and tragically lost Gunnar Mortensen,” 53-year-old Aniston, who is also an executive producer of the show, posted to her Instagram story. “One of the bright lights on our @themorningshow set. As a camera assistant, he was so skilled and dedicated to his job. We are going to miss you, Gunnar.” According to the online fund-raiser set up by his Local 600 union, Mortensen leaves behind his wife Keely and his 2-year-old son, Lars. As of Friday, the GoFundMe raised $130,245 of its $20,000 goal. Mortensen also worked on  the TV series “Transparent,” “The Rookie,” “I’m Dying Up Here” and “Sons of Anarchy.” He also worked with “The Morning Show” star and producer Reese Witherspoon on her upcoming romantic comedy with Ashton Kutcher titled “Your Place or Mine.” Season 3 of “The Morning Show” has been confirmed, but a release date has not been set.
