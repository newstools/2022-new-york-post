Sonja Morgan is bringing in the big guns when it comes to selling her townhouse this time around. On and off the market for the past 10 years with various real estate brokerages, the “Real Housewives of New York” star has decided to list her Upper East Side pad again — for $8.75 million — only this time with someone who specializes in townhouses in particular. Coming from a year off the market, The Post first reported, 35-year real estate veteran Thomas Wexler with the brokerage, Leslie J. Garfield & Co., now holds the listing. “Back when Sonja Morgan (and her husband) purchased the house, we represented the sellers at the time,” Wexler told The Post. “We have sold this house three times before, way back in the day, including the time we sold it to Sonja.” “She now has the best townhouse broker that you can find anywhere,” Wexler said with a laugh. “I think this is a good time to put it on the market. The house is priced well and it should sell.” Morgan remodeled the home during the pandemic. On the fourth floor is another bedroom with a walk-in closet and an expansive terrace. The top floor contains two more bedrooms and the wet bar. It also holds the washer/dryer area. Sonja first put the home for sale back in 2013 for $9.95 million amid her divorce from J.P. Morgan heir John A. Morgan. Morgan, 58, found a buyer in 2017, but decided to turn down the offer because she felt her daughter, Quincy, needed stability while going through her parents’ separation. The reality star and entrepreneur was allowed to keep the townhouse in 2015 after she settled her five-year-long bankruptcy case following her divorce. But now she is hoping this will be the last time she will have to put the home on the market. “At this point, this house is nothing more than a financial drain, an emotional drain,” she explained on Season 12 of “Real Housewives of New York.”
