A daughter’s touching final act for her dying dad in hospital has touched hearts across Australia. Pennelope Ann filmed herself giving her terminally ill father a final sip of his favorite drink, Bundaberg Rum. Her TikTok video shows her cracking a can of Bundy and using a syringe to collect a small amount of the booze. “I came prepared for the send-off,” she says. “Give him a little taste here.” The man’s wife then tells him they are going to give him a final drink. “We brought you rum dad,’ Ms. Anne says. “We’re going to put it in the injection and put it in your mouth.” She then squeezes a small amount of the rum into her dad’s mouth and asks if it tastes good. He manages to nod, causing the two women to laugh. “Hell yeah,” Ms. Anne says. “Hell yeah.” She captioned the heartwarming video: “One last drink with dad before his spirit returned to the universe. Until we cross paths again old man. I love you.”
