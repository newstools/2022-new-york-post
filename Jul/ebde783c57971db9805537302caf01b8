A man who allegedly attacked and hurled racist comments at two women of Asian descent in a Midtown Manhattan subway station was indicted on hate crime charges Wednesday. Derrick Johnson, 40, approached the women at the Rockefeller Center station on May 8 and doused them with an unidentified liquid during his intolerant tirade, prosecutors alleged. “You f—ing Chinese. I don’t know why you’re here in America,” Johnson allegedly barked at one of the victims before he charged at her, causing her to fall to the ground, according to law enforcement sources. The suspect then allegedly spit at her as she laid on the ground, sources said. The 26-year-old woman’s fall resulted in “significant bruising” to her arms and legs and “substantial pain and swelling to her head and jaw,” according to a press release from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Johnson was charged with assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment, ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation and remanded to jail at his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court. “The subway is central to our city, and riders of all backgrounds deserve safety when they travel,” Bragg said in a statement. “The rise of bias-driven crimes is unacceptable. We are expanding our Office’s Hate Crimes Unit to enhance these prosecutions while increasing community engagement and other preventative measures.” Johnson was also arrested last month for attacking two officers who were responding to a call for a lewd male in Chelsea, police sources said. In that attack, he allegedly got on top of one cop and repeatedly struck them in the face before hitting another officer in her face, sources said. Attacks on Asian-Americans skyrocketed in New York City and across the country during the pandemic after some elected officials blamed the coronavirus on China.
