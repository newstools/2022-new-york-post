CLEVELAND — Manny Bañuelos will be seeing the Yankees again soon — just from across the field. The Yankees traded the left-hander to the Pirates on Sunday for cash considerations, two days before the two teams begin a series in Pittsburgh. Bañuelos, the Yankees’ former top prospect who finally made the team a decade later, had been designated for assignment last Tuesday after posting a 2.16 ERA across four appearances out of the bullpen. The 31-year-old was removed from the roster to make room for JP Sears, who came up to make a spot start against the Athletics. Manager Aaron Boone had been hopeful the Yankees could keep Bañuelos, but instead he will join a rebuilding Pirates team.
