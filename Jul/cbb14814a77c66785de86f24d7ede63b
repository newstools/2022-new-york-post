Anthony Richardson, one of the top college football quarterbacks in the country, is taking a stand against assault rifles in his own way. The Florida signal-caller said on Sunday that he will no longer go by his “AR-15” nickname as part of his personal brand because he doesn’t want to be associated in any way with the assault rifle that has been used in mass shootings. “While a nickname is only a nickname and ‘AR-15’ was simply a representation of my initials combined with my jersey number, it is important to me that my name and brand are no longer associated with the assault rifle that has been used in mass shootings, which I do not condone in any way or form,” Richardson wrote in a post on his official website. “My representatives and I are currently working on rebranding, which includes the creation of a new logo and transitioning to simply using ‘AR’ and my name, Anthony Richardson.” The rifle was used in the killing of 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in May. After the advent of college athletes profiting from using their name, image, and likeness (NIL last year), Richardson started an apparel line. It involved jerseys, long-sleeve shirts, and wristbands, among other things. He will no longer use the scope logo. Richardson split time with Emory Jones a year ago and showcased an explosive ability as both as a runner and a thrower. He scored nine touchdowns in limited duty but will be the guy for the Gators this year after Jones transferred to Arizona State.
