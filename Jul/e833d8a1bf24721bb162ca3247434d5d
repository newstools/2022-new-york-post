Tim Tebow offered high praise for former Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral at this week’s SEC Media Days and appeared to forget the Manning family in the process. When discussing the state of the Rebels’ football program entering the 2022 season, Tebow lamented the void left by Corral, a third-round pick by the Panthers in this year’s NFL Draft. “You’re also trying to replace probably the best quarterback in school history,” Tebow, a former standout for SEC foe Florida, said on “SEC Now.” Tebow’s declaration is noteworthy mainly because of Ole Miss’ vaunted quarterback pedigree — or, more accurately, it’s Manning pedigree. Giants legend Eli Manning starred for the Rebels from 2000-03. During his time in Oxford, Manning set or tied 47 program records, including most passing yards (10,119) and passing touchdowns (84). And Eli’s Dad, Archie Manning, played for the Rebels from 1968-70, twice netting a top-four finish in Heisman Trophy voting. Both Mannings have their number retired by the program. Corral, meanwhile, was a dynamic collegiate player in his own right. He led Ole Miss to a 10-win season in 2021, throwing for 3,349 yards and tallying 31 total touchdowns during his last hurrah as a Rebel. But while it’s certainly true Corral will be difficult to replace for this year’s Ole Miss team, perhaps Tebow jumped the gun a bit placing him atop the school’s Mount Rushmore.
