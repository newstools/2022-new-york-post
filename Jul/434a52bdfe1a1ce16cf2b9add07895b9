Adoree’ Jackson’s tenure in Tennessee did not pan out as both parties had hoped, and the current Giants cornerback faulted his inability to “jell” with Titans coach Mike Vrabel. “I really got tested with adversity after my rookie season because everybody on the staff got fired,” Jackson, a first-round pick by the Titans in 2017, said on Tuesday’s episode of the “Cut To It” podcast. “… Vrabel got there and, at the end of the day, I had to get used to him and what he wanted — the type of player he wanted and the style he wanted, as that being my first time trying to get used to it. “We didn’t jell. It didn’t mesh right. My play didn’t work and the way he was coaching didn’t work for me.” Jackson still emerged as one of the league’s top outside corners in Tennessee. Since 2019, he boasts the fifth-lowest target rate in the NFL at just 12%. Last season, in his first with the Giants, Jackson posted a PFF grade of 74.9 — up from 58.7 the year before. The Titans released Jackson in March 2021, allowing him to sign a three-year, $39 million contract with the Giants. And while the cornerback may have lacked chemistry with Vrabel, he maintained that the relationship is still one of respect. “The thing he taught us the most was about second chances,” Jackson said. “He was like, ‘Man, a lot of people don’t get second chances. If you do, make sure you make the most of it.’ I say that all the time now. “At the end of the day, even though we didn’t mesh as a player and coach, as people, I can resonate with some of the things he was saying. At the end of the day, I can never bash him or say anything bad.” Vrabel has led the Titans to three playoff appearances in four seasons, posting a 43-27 record. Jackson will now go through a coaching change with the Giants with Brian Daboll replacing Joe Judge. Jackson and Daboll will head to Nashville to take on Vrabel’s Titans in the season opener on Sept. 11.
