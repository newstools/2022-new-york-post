President Biden is experiencing body aches and other minor symptoms that “continue to improve” with treatment, three days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, his doctor said in a letter Saturday. “His primary symptoms, though less troublesome, now include sore throat, rhinorrhea [a runny nose], loose cough and body aches,” presidential physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor wrote. “His voice remains deep. His pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain entirely normal. His oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room air. His lungs remain clear.” O’Connor also noted that Biden completed a second day of treatment with Paxlovid and will continue receiving the anti-viral drug. Biden on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 — one day after giving a gaffe-filled speech that spurred health concerns and less than a week after returning from meetings in Saudi Arabia with killer Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Biden, 79, is the oldest-ever American president and his advanced age puts him at elevated risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, though he has received four shots of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, reducing the risk, and is being treated with antiviral drug Paxlovid. He managed to evade the virus for more than 2 1/2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by campaigning for president largely from his home in Wilmington, Delaware.
