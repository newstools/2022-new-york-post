The Mets and Cubs will play the second of a four-game series Friday at Wrigley Field and I’m choosing to back the visitors as road favorites. Cubs starter Marcus Stroman has not pitched very well this season at Wrigley Field. In his four home starts, the Cubs are 0-4, with Stroman carrying an ERA of 5.20. Expand the sample to include all of Stroman’s starts this season, and the Cubs would be 2-8 overall. Plus, six of Stroman’s eight allowed home runs this season have come at Wrigley, where he’s also surrendering an opponents’ batting average of .369.  The Mets are expected to throw Taijuan Walker, who arrives in great form and has been fantastic away from Queens. In his nine road starts, the Mets are 6-3 outright and are giving Walker about 3.5 runs. Walker’s last two starts have proven strong as well. In those two outings, Walker has allowed only 10 total bases and an opponent batting average of .234. Plus, In seven starts against NL teams with losing records, Walker has allowed 5.3 total bases on average and has surrendered an opponents’ batting average of just .249. The play: Mets -130 BetMGM.
