Wins for a starting pitcher — once the standard for measuring a hurler’s success — have gradually become less relevant in an era defined by the extensive use of bullpens and a deeper analytical dive into numbers that reflect performance over the unpredictable nature of run support. Max Scherzer is close to joining the 200-win club for his career, which would place him with Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke among active pitchers who have reached the milestone. For his career, Scherzer is 196-98 with a 3.13 ERA over 15 seasons with the Diamondbacks, Tigers, Nationals and Mets. Behind Scherzer on the active list in wins are Clayton Kershaw (192) and Adam Wainwright (190). Then there is a significant drop-off — veterans such as David Price (155), Johnny Cueto (139) and Madison Bumgarner (132) would need significant late-career magic to reach 200. Gerrit Cole, who is 31 and owns 126 career wins, might be the active pitcher with the best shot of getting to 200 after Scherzer and Kershaw — Wainwright is leaning toward retirement after this season and would need 10 wins in the second half — but may need everything to break in his favor. Scherzer recently spoke to Post Sports+ and offered his thoughts on approaching 200 victories as well as his ideas to get starting pitchers (and by extension starters’ wins) back into the headlines.
