President Biden made a shocking gaffe about the Holocaust as he arrived in Israel on Wednesday — saying it’s important to “bear witness” to the “honor of the Holocaust.” Speaking moments after he landed in Israel on Air Force One, Biden spoke about his plan to go to the “hallowed ground” of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem later in the day. “I will once more return to the hallowed ground of Yad Vashem to honor the 6 million Jewish lives that were stolen in a genocide and continue — which we must do every, every day — continue to bear witness, to keep alive the truth and honor of the Holocaust,” the blunder-prone president said, before correcting himself to say “horror of the Holocaust.” The president continued, “[and] honor those we lost so that we never, ever forget that lesson and to continue our shared, unending work to fight the poison of anti-Semitism wherever it raises its ugly head,” the president said. Biden — whose trip to Israel is his first as president — laid a wreath ​at Yad Vashem to remember the millions killed in the Holocaust, before meeting with two women who survived the Nazi death camps. The president, wearing a skullcap, got down on one knee to directly address the women, Rena Quint and Giselle Cycowicz. Joined by Prime Minister Yair Lapid and President Isaac Herzog at the memorial, Biden signed the visitors’ book. “It is a great honor to be back — back to my emotional home,” Biden wrote​, the Times of Israel reported​. “We must never, ever forget — because hatred is never defeated — it only hides. We must teach every succeeding generation that it can happen again unless we remember. That is what I teach my children and grandchildren. Never forget.”
