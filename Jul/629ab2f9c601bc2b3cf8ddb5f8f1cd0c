This beauty tip may sound intoxicating, but it could help you feel like your younger self. A skin care expert has gone viral on TikTok for using the Japanese alcoholic drink sake on her body to help her look more youthful. Posting under the handle @naturalfacebible, the skin care guru revealed her “Japanese skin beauty secret” in a video with nearly 210,000 views in under a week. The snap showed her painting a mixture of sake, powder and water onto her face and neck. “[This] Japanese skincare routine to fade dark spots, prevent skin aging,” the 46-year-old captioned the clip. “If you only drink Sake, your skin is missing out on its superpower skin benefits,” she noted. She later added in her comments section: “[I’m] obsessed with Japanese beauty secrets and this brightening, spot fading, moisturizing, pure Sake mask.” The influencer also explained to her viewers how sake is, in fact, acceptable to use on your skin since the Japanese drink is made from yeast, fermented rice and koji. “[The] nutrients left from the [sake] yeast remains, including carbohydrates, protein, fibers [and] vitamin B,” she stated in her comments. A bottle typically contains about 14% to 16% of alcohol. Although skin care has taken TikTok by storm, it has caused much confusion over which tips and tricks are actually better for your skin. Dermatologists are warning users not to believe everything they watch on the social media platform in regard to their beauty routines. New York dermatologist Hadley King, MD, spoke to The Post recently about misinformation on the app, revealing that deciding which “hacks” to use requires a good amount of skepticism. “There are lots of board-certified dermatologists providing great educational posts on TikTok, so there’s plenty of good information out there, but there’s misinformation too,” King said. “Remember to consider the source and their qualifications, and look for expert advice from qualified professionals!” she advised.
