Three years ago yesterday, Kevin Durant altered the landscape of the NBA by agreeing to join the Nets. Yesterday, Durant rocked the league again, requesting a trade out of Brooklyn — less than one year after signing a four-year extension with the team and just days after co-star and close friend Kyrie Irving opted into the final year of his contract with the Nets. For the third time since 2016, teams are lining up for a chance to acquire Durant and become the favorite to win next year’s championship. After Durant signed with the Warriors in 2016, Golden State won back-to-back titles. Last year, Durant’s toes — as well as injuries to Irving and James Harden — sabotaged his best chance to bring a championship to Brooklyn. The Nets entered this past season as the title favorites. Then, Irving solidified his reputation as the league’s most unreliable teammate. Harden forced his way to Philadelphia in exchange for the league’s second-most unreliable teammate (Ben Simmons). And the Nets were embarrassed in a first-round sweep against the Celtics. Durant, who turns 34 in September, knew his window to bring a championship to Brooklyn had closed. The Nets (rightfully) sacrificed everything — a promising young cast, a talented young coach and an enviable culture — for a chance to land the best player in the world. The gamble failed. Durant’s two healthy seasons with the team resulted in one playoff series win.
