A Bronx man who fatally strangled his mother-in-law with a computer cord in a dispute over custody of his kids was sentenced Wednesday to 25-years-to-life in prison for the shocking crime. Angel Montanez, 42, was accused of killing 65-year-old Lidia Herrera in her apartment in a brutal 2019 attack that woke his children – two of whom witnessed their grandmother’s death, Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said. “The defendant killed the grandmother of his children while his three children were in her home,” Clark said in a statement. “Two of them witnessed the murder and are living with that trauma. A jury found him guilty of second-degree murder and he will spend many years in prison for destroying so many lives in a single heinous act.” Herrera allegedly had an order of protection against her son-in-law He went to her Morrisania apartment at around 3 a.m. on July 3, 2019, and an argument broke out as his three children — two boys ages 10 and 6 and a 4-year-old girl – slept in a room nearby. Montanez then allegedly punched his mother-in-law in the head and wrapped an HDMI cable around her neck. Herrera was found with a fractured bone in her neck, broken thyroid cartilage and abrasions on her face and body, the DA said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
