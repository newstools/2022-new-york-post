Dozens of people were injured when a school bus overturned on a Bronx parkway early Thursday, authorities said. The bus was heading north on the Hutchinson River Parkway just before 6 a.m. when the driver tried to turn from the middle lane and get off at Exit 1a — Bruckner Boulevard West — causing it to overturn, cops said. No kids were on board, but the 36 adults riding the bus were hurt, cops said. Thirty-three of them were listed in serious but stable condition, with the three others suffering minor injuries, the FDNY said. Striking photos show the yellow bus on its side with injured passengers scattered on the ground next to the vehicle. Mayor Eric Adams said the bus was carrying drivers for the city’s summer school and camp program for 110,000 school-aged kids, Summer Rising. “The safety of every member of our community is our top priority and thankfully, at this time, no major injuries have been sustained on board,” Hizzoner said. “Additionally, no students were on the bus.” Schools Chancellor David Banks said that morning and afternoon bus routes for the city’s summer camp-school program, Summer Rising, may be impacted. “The safety of every member of our community is our priority, and thankfully no major injuries were sustained in this morning’s bus accident in the Bronx,” Banks said. “The incident involved employees of one of the DOE’s contracted busing providers – no students were on the bus.” The bus company, Consolidated Bus Transit Inc., covered half of the 34 routes impacted by the accident, ABC7 reported, and expected to double up on more than a dozen routes.
