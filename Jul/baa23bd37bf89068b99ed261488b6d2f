The Pac-12 was dealt a significant blow last week after USC and UCLA announced their plans to join the Big Ten in 2024. Now, the struggling conference is looking to join forces with the ACC in an attempt to keep their head above water. The ACC and Pac-12 are considering a “loose partnership” that would likely entail an inter-conference “championship game” at the end of the season in Las Vegas, according to CBS Sports’ Dennis Dodd. The idea, which many believe was proposed by the ACC, is viewed as a method to generate more money for the conferences through ESPN, their mutual media rightsholder. Albeit a step in the right direction, the proposal would likely bear little impact if it came to fruition – ESPN possesses cost certainty with the ACC through 2036. The scheme would more so be seen as a “strength in numbers” move, allowing the 24 combined ACC and Pac-12 programs to muster a modest challenge against the growing financial gap between them and the 32 teams in the SEC and Big Ten. The Pac-12 is already feeling the negative monetary effects of two of their team’s departures. Following the Trojans and Bruins’ shocking exodus, rights for Pac-12 teams have dropped from $42 million all the way down to $30 million annually. With the Pac-12 and Big-12 dwindling in numbers (Texas and Oklahoma are leaving the latter conference in 2025), midsized conferences such as the ACC are scrambling to ensure they too don’t fall victim to the SEC and Big Ten. Circulating rumors theorize a combination of Clemson, Florida State and Miami could be the SEC’s next targets if they choose to expand again. The Big 12 is contemplating adding up to six Pac-12 schools in an attempt to reinforce itself, with Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, Utah, Oregon and Washington being likely targets. As for the Pac-12, the ailing conference is just looking to remain relevant – the league recently announced it would market early to work out the rights for its ten current teams.
