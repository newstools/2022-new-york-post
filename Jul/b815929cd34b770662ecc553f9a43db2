We have a new leader in the American League MVP race as Shohei Ohtani is now the odds-on favorite (-105 at BetMGM) after tossing another gem this past week to pick up his sixth straight win. Ohtani has allowed just two earned runs during that span of 39 ²/₃ innings. Through 15 starts, Ohtani is 9-4 with a 2.38 ERA and a 0.99 WHIP. Ohtani’s advanced numbers are exceptional, given his 2.27 FIP and 2.42 xFIP. In 2021, he won the AL MVP award after leading all of baseball with a 9.0 WAR. As a hitter, his WAR value was 4.9 and 4.1 as a pitcher. This season he leads the American League with a composite 4.9 WAR — 3.2 as a pitcher, 1.8 as a hitter, and -0.1 for defense. Thus, it’s almost as if Ohtani can take two separate routes to the MVP award whenever he steps on the field. And given his dual-threat ability, he’s an instant threat to win the award each year. With Ohtani now the favorite, Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge has the second shortest odds at +160. And while this MVP award seemed to be almost a lock for Judge, given his 33 home runs, it is now Ohtani’s to lose. We’ve seen players put up prodigious home run numbers in baseball. But you’d have to go back to 1919 (The Babe, George Herman Ruth Jr.) to find a player as dominant at the plate and on the mound. As a result, it’s impossible to overlook Ohtani’s unique skill as a ballplayer. And I don’t expect it to go unnoticed by MVP voters. The play: Ohtani to win AL MVP (-105).
