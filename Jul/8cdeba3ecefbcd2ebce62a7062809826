The Cardinals couldn’t stop belting homers Saturday. St. Louis made history by smacking four consecutive homers in the first inning of their 7-6 win over the host Phillies at Citizen Bank Park. Dylan Carson, Juan Yepez, Nolan Gorman, and Nolan Arenado all contributed to the cause. “It was really cool just being a part of that,” Arenado said. “It was almost surreal. You didn’t really believe it. Those moments are special. I’m very thankful for them.” The Cardinals tied the MLB record for any inning with four in a row. It was the first time they had done it, and the 11th time overall in big league history. “That was incredible,” Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. “Guys took some good swings. They were on attack.” Kyle Gibson, the unlucky Phillies pitcher who let up the four homers, started the inning with two outs before Paul Goldschmidt singled to right field. The first baseman’s hit eventually allowed the Cardinals to push to an early 2-0 lead when Arenado hit a shot to left-field. Gorman, Carson, and Yepez followed after, pushing the lead to 5-0 in just the first inning. The Chicago White Sox were the last team to hit four consecutive homers, a feat that happened back in 2020. Their opponent, ironically, was the Cardinals. — with AP
