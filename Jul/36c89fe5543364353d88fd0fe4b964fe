The countdown rolls on. We are counting down the Jets’ top 25 players as training camp nears. There are 14 new players in this year’s top 25. Here is a list of the players who dropped off from last year’s list with their 2021 ranking in parentheses: Marcus Maye (2), Jamison Crowder (6), Keelan Cole (9), Jarrad Davis (10), Denzel Mims (11), Folrounso Fatukasi (12), Chris Herndon (15), Vinny Curry (16), Bless Austin (17), Tevin Coleman (18), Tyler Kroft (20), La’Mical Perine (23), Greg Van Roten (24), Alex Lewis (25). As you can see, there has been plenty of roster movement in the past calendar year. There are plenty of new faces in this batch of Jets, as well as several second-year players who were not eligible for last year’s list. A reminder: We do not rank rookies because it is too difficult to project how they will play without ever seeing them compete in an NFL game or training camp.
