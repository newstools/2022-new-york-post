Shopping for knives can be confusing. Take out the guesswork by going with one that’s perfect for every purpose of cutting in the kitchen. The Kiru Knife Kitchen Master is a multipurpose traditional Japanese blade, used for everything from slicing fish to chopping vegetables. It’s even capable of doing tasks that are usually reserved for a special Chef’s knife. A lightweight, double-bevel edge is ready to get your slicing done precisely, in any cutting style. It’s created in the traditional Japanese Honbazuke method, meaning it’s sharpened and polished by hand in three stages with precision-forged blades that have an ultra-premium imported Japanese VG10 cutting core. Good knife-makers know that the handle is just as important as the blade. This has been taken into account with the Kiru Knife Kitchen Master, as it’s equipped with a G-10 Garolite handle that’s highly impervious to heat, cold, and moisture with military-grade strength and life-long durability. It’s also ergonomic, allowing for superior hand control, agility, and comfort. Get yourself one go-to kitchen knife that works for all purposes and can last you a lifetime, from this summer of cookouts and well beyond.
