A California woman was caught on video setting a man on fire at a local park, according to police. Patricia Castillo, 48, doused her victim with gasoline as he lay on the grass in a park in Sanger near Fresno shortly after 9 p.m. Thursday, then set the man ablaze, cops said in a Facebook post. “The video shows Castillo approaching the victim and throwing a liquid from a cup onto [him] and she and the victim appear to argue before Castillo sparks a lighter and lights the victim on fire,” the Sanger Police Department wrote. The victim was rushed to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Castillo has been charged with attempted murder, arson and conspiracy, police said. The surveillance footage was released by police. Police said a second person, Leonard Hawkins, was also arrested for allegedly providing the flammable liquid to Castillo. It is not immediately clear what Hawkins was charged with. Police have not said if Castillo and the victim knew each other or what the motive was. A spokesman for the Sanger Police Department said Sunday that the incident remains under investigation.
