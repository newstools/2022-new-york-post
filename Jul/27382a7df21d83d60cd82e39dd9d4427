A woman’s unusual engagement ring sparked a slew of comments on Facebook. The woman, who has not been identified, sent a photo of her ring to a private Facebook group, which has over 117,000 members, called “That’s it, I’m ring shaming,” according to the Sun. Typically, an engagement ring is a single or double band. Her ring looks like several bands that went to her knuckle. The comments showed no mercy. “Call it what it is, shackles for your finger. The old ball and chain really took that literally,” the jokes started. “When you get engaged at 8 p.m. but your finger has to go into battle at 8:15,” one person commented. Another chimed in: “A moment of silence for that knuckle.” “Ring? It’s like a chastity belt for ya finger,” one person said. A common insult was that the ring looked like a combination lock that someone would find on a briefcase and that the real ring was underneath it all. “That ring is a combination lock and if you line up the numbers correctly it pops off and you can put on a decent wedding ring,” one person said. Another agreed. “Yeah you twist it for the right combo and marital bliss pops out… or self-respect?” It was assumed that the woman liked her ring, and one commenter who watched her engagement video seemed to think that each band signified something for the couple. “I don’t remember the whole explanation now but basically [she] got a new ring for every thing… first two were engagement ‘set’ next was wedding and then a bunch of other stuff that you don’t usually get rings for.”
