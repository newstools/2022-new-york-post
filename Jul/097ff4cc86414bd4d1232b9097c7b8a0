Newlyweds Brooks Koepka and Jena Sims are officially in honeymoon mode. The 33-year-old actress and philanthropist gave her Instagram followers a peek Tuesday at the couple’s sunny getaway, one month after she and Koepka, 32, tied the knot in Turks and Caicos. In one post, Sims — who recently announced her fashion collab with One One Swimwear — joked about Koepka’s skills as an Instagram husband as she posed for a photo in a black and white bikini while eating sushi. “Hey want me to get a pic of you in your swim line??” Sims captioned the shot before immediately following up with, “Better @bkoepka.” Koepka later cozied up to Sims on a lounge chair near the water as he relaxed in a pair of animal-print swim trunks. Before jetting off to paradise with Sims, Koepka competed in the 150th British Open at St. Andrews. The golfer, who recently defected to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf, failed to make the cut. While Koepka hit the links, Sims turned to TikTok, where she recently posted a cheeky video depicting a lingerie fantasy versus reality. “What my husband thinks he’s coming home to after a long day of golf…,” Sims wrote of the video, which featured her wearing a silk black camisole before a quick transition to sweats. “Sorry Brooks,” she later added. The longtime couple now appears to be enjoying some time off following months of wedding planning and tournaments. In the days following their destination nuptials, Koepka competed in the U.S. Open, which he won in 2017 and ’18.
