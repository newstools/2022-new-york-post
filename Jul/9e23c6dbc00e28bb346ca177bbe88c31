A drought in Northern Ireland helped uncover an ancient manmade island fit for a king. Members of the Northern Island historical group Loup Historical Society happened upon the settlement, known as a crannog, near Lough Neagh, the largest lake in the British Isles, the BBC reported. The medieval dwelling place, housed in a swamp, was discovered after hot weather dried up the area southeast of Londonderry. Archaeologists are calling the find an important one because the crannog is made of stone. The ancient homest were typically created out of materials such as wood or clay. “They reckon this is a place for the highest of the highest king at that time,” Sean Corey of the Loup Historical Society, told the BBC.
