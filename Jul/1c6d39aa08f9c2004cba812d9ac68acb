Olympic hopeful and Japanese triathlete Tsudoi Miyazaki, 25, was killed Wednesday in France while at a training camp after competing in the Pontevedra World Cup in Spain last weekend. Miyazaki was allegedly riding her bike during a practice session near Orleans — a city 69 miles outside of Paris — when she was fatally struck by a car, Triathlon.org reported. French police are still investigating the incident and have not released any information regarding the accident. The Japan Triathlon Union has dispatched additional resources to help in the investigation. Miyazaki was born in Toyama City, Japan, and began competing while she was in college, winning the Japan U23 Triathlon Championships in 2019. According to sources, Miyazaki was aiming to be selected for the 2024 and 2028 Olympics — set to held in Paris and Los Angeles. The aspiring Olympian was ranked 142 in the women’s World Triathlon Rankings at the time of her death.
