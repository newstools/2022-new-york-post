Jalen Brunson is in “paradise.” The point guard is celebrating his four-year, $104 million Knicks deal in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Ali Marks. Marks chronicled a sweet moment between the couple as they embraced poolside on Sunday night. “From our first night in paradise,” Marks captioned the photos. Brunson commented with two white heart emojis. Brunson and Marks are high school sweethearts, dating since 2014. The couple is in for a major life adjustment after Brunson opted to spurn the Mavericks for his huge Knicks offer. Brunson emerged as a valuable contributor for the Mavericks this season and had a breakout postseason helping Dallas reach the Western Conference Finals. The Knicks also added Clippers center Isaiah Hartenstein and re-signed fellow big man Mitchell Robinson in NBA free agency.
