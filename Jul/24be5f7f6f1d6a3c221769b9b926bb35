A UPS driver died after collapsing in the Southern California heat on the job — just one day after his 24th birthday, a new report said. Esteban Chavez Jr., 24, was delivering packages around Pasadena last Saturday afternoon when he passed out in his truck as temperatures soared into the upper 90s, according to KABC-TV. Chavez’s family believes he may have suffered from heat stroke and was comatose for more than 20 minutes before someone noticed and called for help, the affiliate reported. “This is all so sudden,” grieving dad Esteban Chavez Sr. told the station. “He just turned 24 on Friday and he ended up passing away the day after, which was the 25th.” “It kind of hurts that I wasn’t there to pick up my son. It hurts a lot. But I like to think God had a calling for him. They say the good die young. I’m sure my son was one of them,” Chavez continued. “It hurts, it’s a pain that’s never gonna go away. And that’s something I wish on nobody, having the experience to lose your child.” The cause of the young man’s death was still under investigation by medical officials, according to the report. Chavez — a die-hard Los Angeles Dodgers fan who once took a selfie with manager Dave Roberts on a delivery — had reportedly been with the company for four years and loved his work. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our driver Esteban Chavez, and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We are cooperating with the investigating authorities and are respectfully deferring questions about this incident to them,” a UPS statement read, according to the station.
