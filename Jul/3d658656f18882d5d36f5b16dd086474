Disturbing video released by the NYPD Sunday shows a man being hit by a car and then robbed as he lay splayed out on the ground struggling to survive. The 39-year-old victim was walking on the sidewalk at 898 East 169th Street in the Bronx when a black, four-door sedan slammed into him around 6:40 a.m. Saturday, according to police. The video shows the victim being thrown into the air before he lands on the street. Two men who were inside the vehicle that hit him then got out and went through his pockets, taking his belongings, cops said. “The individuals returned back to the scene and check the victim’s pockets before fleeing to parts unknown,” the NYPD said in a release. An emergency crew took the victim to Lincoln Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition, cops said. The first robber was a “male, dark complexion, thin build, Afro hair,” the NYPD said. He was last seen wearing black pants, black sneakers and a hooded sweatshirt. The second was also described as a “male, dark complexion, thin build, Afro hair.” He was last seen wearing light colored sweatpants, a black hooded sweatshirt and sneakers. A third man inside the car was described as a “male, dark complexion, thin build, short hair.” He was last seen wearing black pants, and a light colored hooded sweatshirt.
