Bryson DeChambeau will still be teeing off at this week’s Open Championship with his usual Bridgestone golf ball. But he’ll be doing so without the company as a sponsor after it dropped him over his affiliation with LIV Golf. The shocking move came on Tuesday, when Bridgestone announced it was dumping the 2020 U.S. Open champ after he bolted from the PGA Tour for the controversial Saudi Arabian-backed rival circuit. “The PGA Tour is an extremely important part of professional golf, and Bridgestone has a sports marketing relationship with this highly visible series of tournaments,” Bridgestone said in a statement to Golf.com. “In considering that Bryson DeChambeau will no longer be participating in these events, Bridgestone and Bryson have agreed to end their brand ambassador partnership.” The 28-year-old eight-time PGA Tour winner has been a close partner with Bridgestone ever since he turned pro in 2016. He signed a long-term extension with the company in 2020 which included influence in the development of Bridgestone Tour B golf balls. “I’ve seen a lot of other guys sign up just to be spokesmen for a brand and collect a check,” DeChambeau said. “I have a much deeper role in mind with Bridgestone. I want to be a bigger part of their R&D process and help develop golf ball technology for the future of the game while pushing the limits of golf ball designs to benefit the full spectrum of players.” Other players Bridgestone sponsors include Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, Jason Day, Lexi Thompson and Matt Kuchar.
