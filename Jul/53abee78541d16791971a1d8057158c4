An influencer is being praised for the way she handled being fat-shamed by a stranger in public. TikToker @Strawberryifme — whose account is dedicated to reviewing strawberry-based desserts and fruit — was filming herself about to eat a piece of strawberry shortcake and was holding it up to the camera when she was interrupted by a man. “Mademoiselle, are you going to eat all of that?” he can be heard asking off-screen in the video, which has been viewed over 17 million times. “I don’t know. I think I could,” she responds, unfazed by his interruption. “That’s the reason you are so fat. You know, I’m looking at you,” he continues. “Exactly. That’s how I stay popular, being fat,” she responds, not missing a beat. “Me: unfazed. Try growing up Asian… also called gorgeous the same day,” she wrote on the screen during the interaction. “He said for a big guy like him people think he eats a lot so his mind might be zoomed in on weight maybe,” she wrote in the comments. “For me, imma eat the cake.” The 17-second clip has garnered over 27,500 comments from users praising the user for her cool, calm and collected demeanor throughout the interaction. “She didn’t even flinch or get bothered or have a nervous laughter,” one impressed follower wrote. “I have no idea why strangers have the need to comment on someone’s body,” wrote another incredulous user. In a follow-up video, the TikToker said she started the account because of her love of strawberries. “Strawberrifyme is about finding your own strawberry in your life,” she wrote, adding it’s “something that makes you smile and happy.” “Thank you for your kind words,” she added, telling everyone to be “kind to themselves.”
