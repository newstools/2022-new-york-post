Ivana Trump, the ex-wife of former President Donald Trump and a first lady of New York City society, is set to be memorialized at her funeral Wednesday in a historic church in her Upper East Side neighborhood.Family and famous mourners are expected to flock to St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church to pay their final respects to the 73-year-old Czech-born “power blonde,’’ who died last week after a fall down the staircase at her Manhattan home. The scheduled afternoon service was billed as a “Celebration of Life’’ on invitations sent to friends, some of whom were said to have flown in from Europe to attend. The invite featured a photo of a glamourous-looking Ivana, a onetime competitive skier, on the slopes. The beloved famous New Yorker had been unsteady walking in recent weeks thanks to an ailing hip, pals had told The Post. Ivana grabbed headlines as Donald’s wife, particularly in the 1980s as she and the real-estate tycoon became the Big Apple’s ultimate power couple. They were married for 15 years before divorcing in 1990 amid a sensational scandal involving Donald’s then-mistress, Marla Maples. Ivana and Donald — who had three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — ended up reconciling as friends, and she said she became his sounding board, including involving his political aspirations. He won the presidency in 2016 and served four years. She also was an accomplished businesswoman in her own right. While married to the man she famously dubbed “The Donald,’’ Ivana helped him develop the iconic Trump Tower in Manhattan and managed The Plaza hotel in the city after he bought it. When the pair split, she worked at everything from writing advice columns to peddling jewelry and beauty products on home-shopping networks.
