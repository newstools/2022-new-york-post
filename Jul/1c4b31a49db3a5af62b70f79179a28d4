LAS VEGAS — An afterthought at this time last year, Jericho Sims now has a home with the Knicks. The 58th pick in last year’s draft is signing a partially guaranteed three-year deal worth just shy of $6 million with the franchise after being on a two-way contract, The Post has confirmed. The former Texas star appeared in 41 games last year and averaged 2.2 points and 4.1 rebounds. His playing time increased in the second half of the season, and the 6-foot-10 big man registered four double-digit rebounding games. It’s uncertain if the Knicks will use part of their room mid-level exception for this deal. There is also the chance they could free up space if they work out a sign-and-trade with the Mavericks to land Jalen Brunson, who has agreed to a four-year, $104 million contract. Sims figures to be the Knicks’ third-string center, behind Mitchell Robinson and newcomer Isaiah Hartenstein. Tom Thibodeau favorite Taj Gibson is still on the roster, but the Knicks can waive him to free up $5.1 million of cap space. With a two-way now clear, the Knicks are planning to sign second-round pick Trevor Keels to one, The Post confirmed. Both Keels and Sims are in Las Vegas playing for the Knicks’ summer league team. Their first game is Friday night against the Warriors.
