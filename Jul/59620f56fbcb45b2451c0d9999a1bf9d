This grandmother tried to prove she’s still got it, but all she got was stuck. Donna Turner made a TikTok titled, “Mum stuck in tunnel” that showed her mother, Tina, in a wire tunnel at a playground in an attempt to keep up with her grandkids. The video shows Tina trying to shimmy her way out of the tunnel. She kept trying, but no position allowed her to get all the way out. Viewers can hear her daughter in the background yelling, “Just put your head forward.” But Tina said, “I can’t, I’m too fat to get ’round.” Backup then came to the rescue as Sean, Donna’s brother and Tina’s son, also climbed into the tunnel next to Tina and used his feet to try to push her out. Sean then tried to show his mom how to turn herself over, but Tina said she couldn’t. Eventually, the entire playground was invested in Tina breaking free from the tunnel as viewers can hear someone in the background say, “Come on Tina!” Donna thought her phone battery would die by the time the video ended. Thankfully, before any sort of fire department needed to be called, Tina was able to lie on her back and flip herself over to get out. People flocked to the comments to talk about just how funny they thought the whole experience was. “Omg I can’t breath watching this,” one wrote. While another added: “Bless her! I bet she was glad she put her modesty shorts on under her dress.” “This has made my day!” a third commented. “Why didn’t she go [back] the way she came?” someone else asked. To which Donna replied, “My brother told her she couldn’t because there was a queue of children waiting behind her.” Donna said the whole thing started over her mother still thinking she was a teen who could keep up.
