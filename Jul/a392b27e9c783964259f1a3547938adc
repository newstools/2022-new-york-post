Five people were hurt — two critically — in four shootings that erupted across the Big Apple overnight, authorities said. A 19-year-old man is clinging to life after he was shot in the head on Claremont Parkway near Crotona Avenue in the Crotona Park East section of the Bronx around 4:30 a.m. Friday, authorities said. He was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in critical condition, police said. The suspect fled after the shooting, and the motive was not immediately known. Photos show a silver sedan crashed into a wall at the scene of the shooting. About two hours earlier, a 56-year-old man also suffered life-threatening injuries in a shooting on the grounds of NYCHA’s Queensbridge Houses on 12th Street in Long Island City, cops said. The victim was involved in a dispute when he was shot once in the chest, police said. A man in his 20s, with a dark complexion, last seen wearing all black and white sneakers, fled after the shooting, cops said. In the earliest Friday morning shooting, around 12:20 a.m., a 21-year-old man was blasted in the stomach and a 22-year-old man in the left foot on Gates Avenue near Lewis Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, authorities said. Both only reported hearing shots and feeling pain, cops said. Also in Brooklyn, a 40-year-old man was shot in the right leg on St. Marks Avenue near James E. Davis Avenue in Crown Heights around 8:30 p.m. Thursday, cops said. He also told cops he heard shots and felt pain, and went to the same hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
