Wanda Sykes reportedly backed out of a scheduled guest-hosting gig on ABC’s “The View” due to the presence of former Trump press aide Alyssa Farah Griffin on the show’s panel. Comedian Sykes, a frequent guest panelist and noted critic of former President Donald Trump, was slated to appear on “The View” last Friday, according to a report. However, she purportedly nixed the plan after her publicist learned that Farah Griffin would serve as a co-host on the program. “She didn’t want to be part of helping a Trumper launder her reputation,” a source described as a “View” insider told the Daily Beast regarding the turn of events. The View declined to comment on the report. The Post has also reached out to Sykes’ representatives for comment. Sykes, 58, was heckled by fans in New Jersey after she opened a set with a series of jokes about Trump. She also took aim at Trump in her 2019 Netflix special “Not Normal.” Liberal-minded guests could soon have to cross paths with Farah Griffin on a permanent basis. The former White House director of strategic communications is purportedly viewed as the frontrunner to become a permanent co-host on “The View” alongside mainstays Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sonny Hostin and Sara Haines. The next permanent conservative co-host would replace Meghan McCain, who exited her role on “The View” last year. The Post reported earlier this month that The View would likely name a permanent successor before its current season ends on August 5 – with Farah Griffin on a short list of frequent guest hosts thought to be in the running for the job. Former GOP communications director Tara Setmayer, another frequent guest, is also in contention. Farah Griffin has become a vocal Trump critic since resigning from her role in the administration in December 2020. In June, she told CNN that she heard Trump privately admit to losing the 2020 presidential election.
