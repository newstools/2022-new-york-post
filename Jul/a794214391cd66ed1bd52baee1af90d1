Optical illusions can be a window into our personalities. How a person thinks can determine what patterns or shapes immediately stick out to them. What you notice first in this image can reveal a very key component of your personality: whether or not you are a talkative person. [Warning: Spoilers Below] If the first thing that stuck out to you was a woman’s face, it means you’re a talkative person. You’re the kind of person who doesn’t bottle up their emotions and you’re best suited for jobs that involve talking like sales and teaching. You’re a social creature who’d rather be among people than all by yourself. If the first thing you saw was birds, then you’re the kind of person who would rather keep your thoughts to yourself. You’re not one to wax poetic or go on prolonged soliloquies. In short, you’re not much of a talker. You’d like working in the arts or in other jobs that don’t require much communication.
