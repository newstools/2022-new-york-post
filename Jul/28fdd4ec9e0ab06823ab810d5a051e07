Quickly finding a pair of skis in this tropical optical illusion is quite telling about the slopes of your mind. A busy, beachy scene of red lounge chairs, palm trees, umbrellas, dolphins and an airplane features the winter athletic gear hiding in plain sight like that of a “Where’s Waldo” illustration. If you’re sharp enough to find the skis in 28 seconds or less, it will make you a “record holder,” according to The Sun. [Warning: Spoilers below] But be warned: A series of crabs and starfish were inserted into the sand as a way of making the illusion more challenging to solve, the outlet reported. Okay, get your stopwatch ready and — go! Having trouble? You’re not alone. The skis are perched in the photo’s bottom left area and are disguised by being blended in with a chair back. Optical illusions like this one are a fun diversion but also can hold scientific value for medical professionals. They can help researchers shed light on the inner machinations of the human mind — as well as how it reacts to its surroundings. “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you,” Dr. Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at Goldsmiths University in London, previously told The Sun about how illusions are important to our understanding of brain function. The confounding illusion now joins a long list of optical tricks that are perplexing puzzle players.
