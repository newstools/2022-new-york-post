A dead man was found in a Brooklyn driveway Tuesday — dumped there by another guy using a hand truck, police sources said. The unidentified corpse was found at 931 72nd Street in Dyker Heights around 11:30 a.m., according to police. Private security footage shows another man pushing the dead person onto the property with a hand truck around 12 hours earlier, police sources said. There were no obvious signs of trauma, and the medical examiner will determine the cause of death, cops said. Police and emergency workers flooded the scene after the grim discovery. The body, which had been wrapped in a white sheet, was put into a black bag. George Vlachakus said he’s lived nearby his whole life and has always known the neighborhood to be a quiet one. “It’s crazy that something like this happened here,” he said. “This is Dyker Heights, the quietest neighborhood in Brooklyn,” he said. “It’s not something I expected  – never, never, never. You see these things on TV. You would never believe it would come here.”
