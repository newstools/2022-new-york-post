This nauseating illusion isn’t as black and white as you think. At first glance, it appears to have stacked lines of black and white boxes that are off-center, making the lines seem wavy and bendy. The boxes, all framed with gray borders, look as if they’re stacked vertically by color to some, but others are seeing something totally different. [Warning: Spoilers ahead.] Upon closer look, it’s clear they’re in horizontal rows. But that’s not all. The illusion was posted to Reddit with an even more perplexing inquiry: “Do you see diagonal lines?” This isn’t the first optical illusion to stump people — and it certainly won’t be the last. Illusions regularly circulate online and are a fun way to exercise your brain. Take this one, for example. It looks like a line of legs, but what you see first — in either the positive or negative space — reveals how good of a communicator you are. If you spot the trouser, you’re direct. If instead you see the high-heeled leg, you think before you speak. This other illusion, on the other hand, uses color to play visual tricks. In the image, 12 circles appear against a background of various colored lines, but if you think you can see every color in the frame, look again. From afar, the spheres appear to be different colors due to the colorful lines around them, but removing the lines — or just zooming in on the circles — reveals they’re all just beige. Apparently, solving the illusion in under 5 seconds could indicate heightened intelligence. Other popular illusions include counting hidden animals or revealing a trait about you if you can solve this visual riddlecorrectly.
