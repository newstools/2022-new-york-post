Gregory Itzin, best known for his role as President Charles Logan in the series “24” has died. He was 74. Jon Cassar, an executive producer and director on the popular FOX series confirmed the news in a tweet on Friday morning. “My friend Greg Itzin passed away today. He was one of the most talented actors I had the honor to work with, but more than that he was an all around great guy,” Cassar wrote. “He’ll be missed by his 24 family who had nothing but love & respect for him. You made your mark, now Rest In Peace friend.” The veteran actor featured in a slew of TV shows and movies, but was best known for his role on “24” as diabolical politician Charles Logan, who goes on to become President of the United States. “As an actor who longs to be loved and approved of, I am finding this very gratifying,” he told The Post in 2006. Itzin’s impressive resume included roles on the “Mentalist,” “Mob City,” “NCIS,” “Charlie’s Angels,” “Judging Amy,” “Friends” and “Star Trek.” Itzin leaves behind his wife Judie and his children Wilke and Julia. His cause of death is yet to be determined.
