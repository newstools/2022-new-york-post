Former President Donald Trump was off and running Thursday morning at his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or at least driving. Playing with Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson, along with his son Eric, in the pro-am ahead of this week’s LIV Golf Series tournament at the property, Trump teed off to a smattering of applause from a small crowd of a few dozen officials and other guests (no fans are allowed Thursday). Then he sped up to his approach on the second hole that landed short of the green, nearly driving his cart onto the putting surface before Johnson yelled out from behind for him to move because he hadn’t yet hit his approach. Also among the gaggle, which included secret service and a dozen golf carts for the players and others, were Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump on the hot and humid day. How many holes Trump will play was unclear. Through his first four holes he was 2-over par with two bogeys and two pars with players using the best drive of the group for the pro-am format. One of those pars included Trump scooping up a 5-footer on the par-3 fourth. Trump spoke throughout early parts of his round with Johnson and DeChambeau — two of the better-known faces in the controversial upstart golf league that is funded by Saudi money.  After finishing one hole, Trump chatted briefly with a woman and bragged about the renovations to his Doral, Fla., course that will hold an LIV event later this year. That Trump, whose group also included a Saudi gentleman, chose to play with DeChambeau and Johnson in the first group off at 10 a.m. was hardly a surprise. He has played with both on multiple occasions in South Florida. Other notables playing elsewhere in the pro-am were Charles Barkley, Caitlyn Jenner and Lawrence Taylor.
