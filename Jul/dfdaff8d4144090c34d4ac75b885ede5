A teen previously busted for two hate-crime attacks on Sikh men in Queens was stabbed to death in Brooklyn this week, cops said. Vernon Douglas, 19 — arrested less than three months ago in connection to the hate crimes — was stabbed in the chest on Rockaway Avenue near Lott Avenue in Brownsville just before 9 p.m. Thursday, police said. Witnesses reported he was involved in a dispute with another man before the fatal attack, police said. He was rushed to Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. No arrests have been made. Douglas was arrested on April 14 in connection to the unprovoked April 3 attack on Nirmal Singh, police said. Singh was walking around 6:45 a.m. at 95th Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard in Richmond Hill when Douglas socked him in the nose, causing pain and bleeding, according to cops. The attacker did not say a word and fled after the assault, cops said. Singh, who was wearing traditional Sikh attire at the time of the attack, was treated at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and released. He had only been in the US for two weeks on a visitor visa when he was attacked — and has since returned home to India, according to his family. Douglas was arrested the same day in connection to an April 12 case, cops said. At the same intersection, Douglas — along with Hezekiah Coleman, 20 — beat two men with wooden sticks, pummeled them, snatched off their turbans and swiped some cash, cops said. Both Douglas and Coleman were charged with robbery as a hate crime, assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment based on race or religion, cops said. The Queens DA’s Office did not immediately comment on the circumstances of Douglas’ release, but online records show he had another court date scheduled for July 27 in connection to the April 12 case. The Thursday slaying did not appear to retaliatory or connected to Douglas’ hate-crime arrests, cops said.
