This guy really did have something up his butt. A married man from Iran is recovering after doctors removed a 7 ½ inch water bottle from his rectum. The suspect suppository was discovered after the 50-year-old arrived at the hospital with his wife, who grew concerned once he stopped eating and began to suffer from abdominal pain and constipation. The man continued to successfully hide his painful secret, right up until it was revealed to doctors via CT scan. According to an article in the Clinical Case Reports Journal, the man avoided mentioning that he’d inserted the object himself, due to “embarrassment,” and “fear of his wife.” The case study said that he had inserted the bottle with the bottom going in first, in order to use the top as a grip to pull out. But when the time came to do so, the unfortunate object wound up trapped in the man’s large intestine. Doctors at the Imam Khomeini Hospital in Sari did not mention why exactly how the bottle got stuck there, but did say that sexual gratification is usually behind these sorts of situations. The man was also known to have a history of depression, according to the Clinical Case Reports. He was rushed to emergency surgery to remove it. Surgeons were able to slowly drag the bottle out without causing damage to the intestine. The unfortunate adventurer was discharged three days later and referred to a psychiatric clinic. The man was reportedly back to normal and experiencing no problems one month later. According to medical professionals, similar cases have been reported in men around the world aged 30 to 40. Other objects retrieved from the anus include light bulbs, bottles, truncheons, body spray cans and turkey basters, they said.
