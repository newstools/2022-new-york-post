An off-duty NYPD officer was robbed at gunpoint of his firearm and police identification in the Bronx Wednesday, police said. The 23-year-old had just parked his car around 12:30 a.m. at Garrison Avenue and Barretto Street in Hunts Point and was removing items from his trunk when the masked robber approached, police said. The crook was holding a black firearm and said “hands up,” police sources said. The robber then asked, “Are you a cop?” The thief took his wallet from his left front pants pocket and his Glock 17 from his off-duty holster and fled on Garrison Avenue, the sources said. The wallet contained his police i.d., credit cards, cash and keys. The crook was a male believed to be in his 30’s, with a medium build, black hair and last seen wearing a black shirt, black shorts, white sneakers, a black face mask and a fanny pack around his chest, cops said. Police released video of the crime. The city’s Police Benevolent Association called the robber “brazen.” “We are thankful that our brother is OK, but this situation could have ended much worse,” PBA President Patrick J. Lynch said.  “Not even the sight of a gun and shield will deter these brazen perps. They aren’t worried about consequences, because there are none for them. Meanwhile, cops are definitely thinking about the risks they might face – both the physical danger and the legal consequences – if they try to fight back.” Police said they are investigating the incident.
