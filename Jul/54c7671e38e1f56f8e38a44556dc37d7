The businesses of Marshfield, Missouri, have decided to start a sign war. It began with McDonald’s challenging the local Dairy Queen using a friendly tone, according to BuzzFeed. “Hey DQ! Wanna have a sign war?” the first sign of many read. DQ took the name “war” to heart and went after the infamous McDonald’s ice cream machine. “We wld but were 2 busy makin ice cream,” their sign read. And thus the war began. McDonald’s came back with, “Wow. Salty like our world famous fries.” One of the local banks decided to join in on the fun with an entry of its own. “Don’t be salty on our account,” said Arvest Bank’s sign. But DQ and McDonald’s went back at it. DQ got violent by telling McDonald’s to behave or “we’ll flip you like our blizzards.” McDonald’s hit back with, “That’s cute. Our ice cream makes itself.” DQ decided to reuse their ice cream machine insult with their response, “You mean it actually works? Shocker.” Before the two restaurants knew it, more local businesses were joining in the fun. A place called the Melon Man told people to forget about ice cream entirely because they have watermelons. Mexican restaurant Las Cazuelas pointed out on a sign that they had fried ice cream. Arvest Bank returned to the war by saying, “Ice cream machine broken? We have a loan for that.” But nothing was able to stop McDonald’s and DQ from going after each other. McDonald’s started telling jokes starting with, “What’s a milkman in pantyhose? A dairy queen.” DQ refused to give up and kept fighting back. Their response this time was, “Why dine w/ a clown when u can dine w/ a queen?” McDonald’s then started to go after another fast food restaurant: Sonic. “Sonic makes you eat in your car,” their next sign read. “We invite you in.” But DQ still continued to go after McDonald’s. “Where’s ur meat come from old McDonald’s,” their latest sign said. McDonald’s has yet to post a rebuttal.
