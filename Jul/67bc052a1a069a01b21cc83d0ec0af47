Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers took home his second consecutive NFL MVP trophy in 2021, but after his star receiver Davante Adams left for Las Vegas in a trade with the Raiders, there’s no certainty of a third consecutive award. Josh Allen of Buffalo Bills leads the early betting markets for the 2022 NFL MVP, ahead of some big names. Even though Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off winning his fourth career NFL MVP award, there’s no guarantee he’ll experience the same success after his top receiver darted for Vegas. Because of this uncertainty, we’re seeing other quarterbacks lead the way in the early 2022-23 NFL MVP betting odds. Becoming one of the best young QBs in football after just three seasons has catapulted Allen to the top of the NFL MVP odds for the 2022-23 season. His ability to put up otherworldly numbers through the air while being his team’s most explosive rushing option gives Allen a betting chance. A strong late-season run at the end has placed Mahomes back near the top of the MVP race, where he’s likely to be a fixture for the better part of the next 10 seasons. Swapping Tyreek Hill for JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marquez Valdes-Scantling will be an adjustment, but Mahomes will be fine. The GOAT is back. For those living under a rock, Brady’s brief retirement lasted a matter of days, and he will return to Tampa Bay seeking an eighth Super Bowl ring. Brady has three MVP’s to his name, and needs one more to tie Aaron Rodgers for the most NFL MVP titles. If you fancy the Bucs to make it all the way this year, then look no further than the man who is likely to lead them there.
