A man died after plunging from an escalator rail at The Weeknd’s tour-opening show in Philadelphia. The concertgoer, who has not yet been identified, suffered head trauma after falling about 40 feet at the Lincoln Financial Field on July 14. Officials say the 32-year-old man was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital just after 11 p.m. and was pronounced dead a few minutes after midnight. The tour’s promoter, Live Nation, was also in charge of promoting Travis Scott’s deadly Astroworld Festival which led to 10 deaths and hundreds of injuries. Following an investigation, police told the outlet that the man’s fall appears to have been accidental, with “no foul play suspected,” the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Bob Lange, Senior Vice President of communications for the Philadelphia Eagles team, which operates the Lincoln, said the incident likely happened after the concert was over as people were leaving the building. The Post reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department, Live Nation, and Bob Lange for further comment. The Weeknd’s “After Hours til Dawn” tour showcases the singer’s top tracks from his fourth and fifth studio albums, 2020’s “After Hours” and “Dawn FM” which was released earlier this year. The tour was originally set to kickstart at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, but the gig was postponed due to a nationwide power outage, making Philadelphia’s show the opening concert. The Weeknd’s fans waited long for his tour, which was due to kick off in 2020 but was postponed twice due to the pandemic.
