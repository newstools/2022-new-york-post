A Fire Island lifeguard was bitten by a shark Thursday morning less than a week after another lifeguard was attacked by a shark in the waters off a different Long Island beach. The rookie guard, identified by News12 as 17-year-old John Mullins, was attacked about 150 feet offshore of Ocean Beach during a training exercise at around 11 a.m. He was playing the role of a victim in the exercise when he was bitten on the foot by what officials believe was a 3- to 5-foot tiger sand shark. “I didn’t really feel the bite at first,” Mullins told News12. “My adrenaline was rushing right away.” The other lifeguards helped bring him to shore and he was transported to South Shore University Hospital, where he received a few stitches. Mullins described the terror he felt when he thought the shark was following him and could attack again. “I thought it was following me, so I was freaking out,” the teen said. Guards prohibited swimming at the beach for an hour following the attack. Afterwards, they restricted swimming so that beach-goers were only allowed into waist-deep water. The incident was eerily similar to a shark encounter earlier in the week. In that attack, 33-year-old lifeguard Zach Gallo was also playing a victim during a training exercise off Smith Point Beach Sunday when a shark bit him in the chest and hand. Gallo received a couple stitches for the injuries.
