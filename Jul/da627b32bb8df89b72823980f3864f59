A Florida woman who allegedly hurled xenophobic remarks and pepper-sprayed four Asian women in the Meatpacking District last month was indicted on hate crime charges Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court. Madeline Barker, 47, of Merritt Island, Fla., wore a bright fuchsia dress when she walked up to four Asian women standing outside on Hudson St. and yelled “Why don’t you just go back to your country,” and then began attacking the group with pepper spray. As a result of the assault, all four victims experienced a burning sensation to their faces or eyes as well as substantial pain, according to a press release from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Barker — who pleaded not guilty — was charged with assault as a hate crime. “Hearing the hateful and discriminatory words, ‘go back to your country’ is deeply painful and these women allegedly heard them before enduring the physical pain of Ms. Barker’s pepper spray. People of all backgrounds deserve to feel safe, which is why my Office is enhancing these prosecutions through the expansion of the Hate Crimes Unit,” said Bragg. “Just yesterday, we also announced the indictment of Derrick Johnson, another individual who yelled anti-Asian slurs as he attacked two women. These bias-driven incidents have no place in Manhattan,” the DA continued. Barker is being held at Rikers Island on $20,000 bail because her out-of-state residency made her a possible flight risk.
