Who said dogs couldn’t be cultured? Demi Moore raised some eyebrows after bringing her pet pooch inside the world-famous Louvre museum — despite its strict no animals policy. The 59-year-old Hollywood star shared images of her visit to the Paris gallery on Instagram, showing fans how she and her chihuahua Pilaf soaked up the culture. The pair posed in front of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa painting and later admired the iconic Venus de Milo sculpture. “Pilaf takes the Louvre,” Moore captioned the images shared with her 2.9 million followers. Little Pilaf could be seen tucked into Moore’s shirt. The star’s snaps suggested she and her pooch were the only ones admiring the works of art in what could have been a private tour of the museum. The museum has a strict rule prohibiting animals from being brought inside the building, with the exception of guide and assistance dogs. Listed under the museum’s prohibited items are “all animals, with the exception of guide dogs or assistance dogs accompanying persons with motor or mental impairment.” It wasn’t long before fans questioned Pilaf’s unexpected attendance. “How on earth are you allowed to bring a dog into the Louvre?” asked one fan. “Celebrities think rules aren’t for them,” another wrote. “Sad when celebrities abuse their fame and take their pets in places we common folk can’t,” one fumed in the comments. “The Louvre has a no pet policy with a service animal exemption. Demi Moore you should know better.” Moore’s reps and the Louvre did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
