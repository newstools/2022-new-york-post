Astronaut Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin saw an out-of-this-world bid on Tuesday when his Apollo 11 jacket sold for a record-breaking price. The spaceflight jacket, worn by Aldrin when he accompanied Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins on the iconic space mission to the moon in 1969, was bought by an unidentified bidder for a whopping $2,772,500. The massive bid surpassed what the auction house estimated the item would sell for by nearly a million dollars. The jacket was a part of Sotheby’s “Buzz Aldrin: American Icon” collection, which was a highlight of Sotheby’s Geek Week and boasted historic items consigned directly by Aldrin, who carefully preserved materials from his famous space missions, including Gemini XII and Apollo 11. Joining the extraordinarily priced space jacket was the infamous broken circuit breaker that nearly ended the lives of the Apollo 11 crew, mission documents that accompanied the crew in space, and the famous “Go Army, Beat Navy” banner Aldrin brought with him on his Gemini XII spacewalk. Flight plans for Apollo 11’s mission sold for $819,000 while Aldrin parted ways with his Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, which he received in 1969, for $277, 200. According to Sotheby’s, a selection of 10 lots in the legendary sale of space items were accompanied by a MIRAImage™ NFT, a unique digital identifier that’s linked to the object’s identifying “DNA.” The historic bidding, which went on for nearly 10 minutes, made the Apollo 11 jacket the most valuable American space-flown artifact ever sold at auction, according to Sotheby’s.
