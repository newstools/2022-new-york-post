Over the last two years, comfort and convenience have been a major driving force in fashion. As the athleisure trend rages on, it’s only fitting that the bathrobes get an upgrade, too! The ladies have leggings, and now the guys have the DudeRobe. This genius invention that has been featured on Kickstarter and “Shark Tank” gives the old bathrobe a modern twist. And right now during Deal Days, you can score one for over 30% off at just $100 for a limited time. There’s no coupon needed — just act before July 14th to lock in this savings. The DudeRobe gives the average bathrobe a major upgrade, turning it into a go-to wardrobe staple for men everywhere. It’s not only perfect for when you hop out of the shower, but also can be worn to walk the dog or run errands, thanks to its cool hoodie detail. The outside is made from premium sweatshirt material, so it certainly doesn’t look like the robes of yesteryear. But the inside is made of an extra absorbent, soft fabric that does the robe’s usual job on the sly. The non-floppy arm cuffs make it look like a fashion statement outside the house, while the above-the-knee length is the perfect silhouette to look more like your favorite lived-in jacket. The creators of DudeRobe really thought of everything. Not only did they make this robe stylish enough to wear outside, they also upgraded some other features like the robe’s belt. This one includes a permanently attached belt that is impossible to lose. And there’s even a hidden pocket inside to pop your wallet or keys in and keep them secure and safe.
