Former South Carolina quarterback Phil Petty has died after a brief illness. He was 43. Petty starred for the Gamecocks from 1998 to 2001, emerging as an essential component of the program’s turnaround. Across Petty’s first two seasons, South Carolina managed just one victory; the Gamecocks then went a combined 17-7 from 2000 to ’01, capturing a pair of Outback Bowl victories over Ohio State. Petty ended his South Carolina career with 5,656 career passing yards — the seventh-most in program history — and 28 passing touchdowns. “Phil Petty typified what a Gamecock truly is,” South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner said in a statement Thursday. “A native South Carolinian, he was a fighter on the football field, a tremendous person off the field and beloved by all Gamecocks. He was a great friend to many and a wonderful dad and husband. My prayers go to his wife, Morgan, children, Sage and McCoy, and his many friends.” After his playing career, Petty transitioned into coaching. He spent five years as an assistant coach at East Carolina under Skip Holtz, whose father, Lou, coached Petty at South Carolina. Most recently, Petty was coaching high school football at Gray Collegiate.
