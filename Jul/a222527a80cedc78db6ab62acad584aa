A 16-year-old Texas girl has been arrested after her friend was fatally shot while they were showing off firearms on a livestream, police said. The teenager, who has not been identified, had been holding two handguns as her friend, Princess Omobogie, 18, used to film her for the livestream broadcast at an apartment complex in Garland, police said Thursday. During the live social media broadcast Tuesday, one of the guns went off and struck Omobogie, police said. She was taken in critical condition to the hospital, where she died two days later. After her death, her 16-year-old friend was taken into custody and charged with manslaughter. She’s currently being held at the Dallas County Juvenile Detention Center. Police have declined to release her name since she is a minor. However, police have obtained a copy of the livestream and will be using it in their ongoing investigation.
