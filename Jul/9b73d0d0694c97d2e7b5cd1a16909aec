The Phillies and Cardinals conclude their three-game series Sunday in what is expected to be a good pitching matchup — Philadelphia’s Zack Wheeler (6-4, 2.89 ERA) versus Adam Wainwright (6-5, 3.07 ERA) for St. Louis. Despite their combined 12-9 record, both Wheeler and Wainwright have pitched well this season. Wheeler has allowed three earned runs or fewer in 11 straight starts since April 28. The Phillies’ bullpen has struggled at times, with an ERA just under 4.00 heading into Saturday, but Wheeler has pitched at least six innings in nine of those 11 starts, helping take some pressure off Philadelphia’s relievers. Wainwright is coming off an impressive outing against the Marlins in which he didn’t allow a run over seven innings of work. That ended a two-game skid in which Wainwright give up 14 hits and eight runs over 11 innings. The Cardinals have won eight of Wainwright’s past 10 starts. Each of these pitchers have had success against their Sunday opponent. Current Cardinals hitters are batting just .097 in 33 plate appearances against Wheeler, and Wainwright has held current Phillies hitters to a respectable .244 average in 82 career at-bats.   I see this being a low-scoring game between two strong starting pitchers, but I don’t want to risk the Phillies’ bullpen giving up runs in the later innings. For that reason, I’ll take the under first five innings and hope both starters are on their games Sunday. The play: Phillies-Cardinals Under first five inningsOdds courtesy of BetMGM.
