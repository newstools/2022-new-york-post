Ivana Trump’s funeral will be held Wednesday at a historic Catholic church in the Upper East Side neighborhood where she lived. Ivana’s three children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, plan to attend the service at Manhattan’s St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church — though it’s unclear if her ex-husband, former President Donald Trump, will also be in attendance, sources told The Post. “Donald talked her regularly and sent flowers on every birthday and other occasions,” a source told The Post. “I’m told he’s very upset.” The source added that if the former commander in chief does attend the service, he will come solo, without wife Melania. Ivana died Thursday at age 73 when she accidentally fell down the stairs of her Manhattan home. Pals said she had been suffering from hip problems and had trouble walking in the months and weeks leading up to her death. She suffered “blunt impact injuries” to her torso in the deadly tumble, the New York City Medical Examiner’s Office has said. Sources said mourners will be flying in from Europe for the socialite businesswoman’s funeral. The service — set to begin at 1:30 p.m. — was announced in a “Celebration of Life” invitation obtained by The Post and featuring a stunning, glamorously dressed younger Ivana skiing. She was once a competitive skier. “In lieu of flowers. It’s requested that donations go to the big dog rescue,” a source said. Ivana’s funeral was first reported by Showbiz411 on Saturday evening.
