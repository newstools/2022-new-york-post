Is a sailor’s life the life for thee? In what looks like a scene out of Martin Scorcese’s “Shutter Island,” a decommissioned World War II fort in the middle of the ocean is being auctioned off for first time, starting at just $60,000. Located in the Humber Estuary of Northern England, the concrete vessel was initially constructed between 1915 and 1919 for naval defense during World War I, though it wouldn’t go into use until WWII. Considered a historic listing, the property is defined by the United Kingdom as a “grade II” building or structure that is “of special interest, warranting every effort to preserve it.” Savills National Auctions will present the unique marine dwelling for bidding on July 19. The ship once featured 12-inches of armor on one side and a battery of weapons on the other — enough to support a garrison of up to 200 soldiers, according to the listing. The armor and weaponry were stripped from the site back in 1956. Known as Bull Sand Fort, it stands alonside a smaller sea fort about four yards away, known as Haile Sand. The sea fort is made up of three floors with a basement and a chamber below sea level. It also features a central two-story observation tower. The listing notes that fresh water supply is available at the fort via an artesian well. It also has a balcony and jetty. “In need of refurbishment throughout with potential for development /alternative uses, subject to consent.” the listing explains. “Access by private boat only.”
