Tyler Perry doesn’t care what the naysayers think about his upcoming drama, “A Jazzman’s Blues.” The 52-year-old filmmaker has been working on the 1940s period drama since 1995 and he has something to say to the actors who didn’t want to work with him on it. “With this film, I went to a bunch of up-and-coming young artists who were getting a lot of attention and I asked them about doing the role,” the “Gone Girl” star told People in its recent cover story. “They read the script, they loved the script, but I think there was a reservation or hesitation about working with me in particular on this film, because I guess they didn’t know how it would turn out.” Perry has made a name for himself in Hollywood by creating the effortlessly hilarious character, Madea — having released countless projects and films involving the old woman. However, Perry noted, “Too bad, so sad for them.” Even though several people turned down a role in “A Jazzman’s Blues,” his current cast brought his vision to life. Amirah Vann, Austin Scott, Milauna Jemai Jackson, Brent Antonello, Brad Benedict, Kario Marcel, Lana Young and Ryan Eggold take center stage in the film. “A lot of times these teams don’t necessarily understand the power of my audience and what I bring. The people who are in [A Jazzman’s Blues] made it exactly what it was supposed to be,” he said. “It’s better than I ever thought it would be, but it’s always been very important to me to break new faces. And that has opened the door for me to be able to help so many people,” Perry went on. The “Don’t Look Up” star first began penning the script in the mid-90s, when he was struggling to make ends meet as a playwright. “A Jazzman’s Blues” drops on Netflix on Sept. 23.
