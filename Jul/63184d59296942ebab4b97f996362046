Disturbing video obtained by The Post shows two young men brazenly opening fire on a Manhattan sidewalk in broad daylight, the NYPD said Wednesday. The footage shows one of the shooters throwing his e-bike to the ground at West 114th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem around 1 p.m. Tuesday before engaging in a brief fistfight with another male. Both appear to be teenagers or young adults. The shooter then falls backward onto his buttocks in front of the New Life Juice Bar and Lounge before jumping up with his pistol in hand and wantonly firing at an unseen target down the sidewalk. Meanwhile, a second gunman rides up on an e-bike with a pistol drawn and begins firing in the same direction. Police responded to a 911 call of shots fired at the location soon after, cops said. “Upon arrival officers discovered that an unknown individual(s) created a substantial risk of serious physical injury or death by firing multiple rounds in the direction of an unknown individual,” an NYPD spokesperson said. “There are no arrests or reported injuries at this time.” The investigation is ongoing.
