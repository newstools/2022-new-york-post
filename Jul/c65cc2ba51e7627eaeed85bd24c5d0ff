What will the future of the American workplace look like? According to one TikTok user,  the traditional 9-to-5 is going to look a little different when millennials and Gen Z are in charge. TikTok user Chase posted the now-viral video last month, sharing his thoughts on where corporate America is heading. “Where corporate jargon is no longer a thing. Where glossaries of acronyms are part of your onboarding & PTO (paid time off) isn’t looked down upon by boomers,” he theorized over the top of the clip, which has been viewed more than 756,000 times. “You aren’t feeling okay today & need a mental health day? We gotchu. Out of PTO but need an extra day? Not an issue,” he continued, listing things he hoped would happen in future workplaces. “Soon the boomers be out of here and it’s up to us to set the standard,” he concluded the post. The clip garnered thousands of comments, many in support of Chase’s ideas. “I can feel it coming! 4 day work weeks & fully remote options!” one user cheered in the comments. “As a Millennial manager, it’s a lot more accepted now! It’ll still take a while though … but it’ll eventually get there,” encouraged someone else. Others defended how current workplaces are run, warning millennials and Gen Zers that they might find themselves working differently once they are in managerial positions. “As someone with middle management experience, I can’t wait for y’all to find out why Boomers are the way they are,” the user commented. “They’ll conform just like every other generation,” another agreed, while someone added that it’s going to take a lot longer than two generations to radically change a workplace. “The more things change the more things stay the same,” someone pointed out. “I am a Gen X’er. I hear it all the time, millennials being for themselves. I am starting to see their way,” one user observed.
