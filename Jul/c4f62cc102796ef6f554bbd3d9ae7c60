She got the Medal of Freedom — and a coloring book! A flight attendant offered Simone Biles a coloring book when the seven-time Olympic medalist was mistaken for a child on her flight home from accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week. The 4-foot-8 gymnast, who is 25 years old, shared the embarrassing interaction on her Instagram story along with a selfie in which she made a face in disbelief. “Not the flight attendant trying to give me a coloring book when I board….. I said ‘no I’m good I’m 25,'” Biles captioned the pic, which was screenshotted and shared on Twitter. Biles is tied for the most decorated gymnast in history and had just been in Washington, D.C. Thursday to receive the nation’s highest civilian award among 16 others. The athlete became the youngest person to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom when President Joe Biden placed the award around her neck during a ceremony at the White House and joked that she’ll need to find room for the new medal among her 32 Olympic and World Championship medals. Biles was likely on a flight from D.C. to her home state of Texas when the age mix-up happened. She said another crew member delivered her an alcoholic drink — but asked if she was legal drinking age — after the coloring book incident. “The other flight attendant gave me a mimosa so we’re in the clear,” she wrote. The screenshot of Biles recounting the experience has gone viral on Twitter with more than 160,000 likes. “[I]’m crying at the thought of a flight attendant giving simone biles [sic] the most decorated gymnast in history a coloring book because she is 4’8″,” @mattxiv wrote in the tweet.
