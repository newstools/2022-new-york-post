LAS VEGAS — Kevin Durant’s status has figuratively dominated summer league. Cam Thomas’ scoring has dominated it literally. Which is fitting. It was Durant who was instrumental in the Nets’ decision to draft Thomas last offseason, and Durant who reportedly expressed his desire for Brooklyn to hold onto Thomas at this past season’s trade deadline. Now, on the precipice of winning his second straight Las Vegas Summer League scoring title — the most prolific summer league scorer ever — Thomas is hoping to not just carry that bucket-getting momentum into the regular season, but demonstrate an improved all-around game as well.
