A Staten Island mom was arrested for allegedly assaulting a safety agent at her children’s school Tuesday morning, police said. Aleena Abrams, 43, was charged with one count of assault after she allegedly grabbed the 35-year-old man in a “bear hug” and threw him to the ground at I.S. 49 Berta A. Dreyfus, cops said. The dispute had started after the woman’s 14-year-old son went to the school to pick up his 12-year-old sister. He was turned away because of a policy that prohibits the school from releasing children to other juveniles, police sources said. The mother then went to the school and got into a dispute with the school safety agent, an NYPD employee, cops said. She was arrested later at home. The safety agent was treated for unknown injuries.
