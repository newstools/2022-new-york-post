Jet-setting celebrity DJ Marjorie “Mad Marj” Gubelmann, the socialite and entrepreneur, has quietly sold her posh Upper East Side digs and, we hear, is moving downtown. The residence at 50 E. 77th St. was not officially on the market, but was circulating as a so-called “whisper listing” for $10 million. It sold for $9.69 million last month in an off-market deal. The spacious 3,500-square-foot, ninth-floor home boasts double-height 16-foot ceilings in the living room. It also features three bedrooms, 4½ baths, a dining room, a library, a home office and a staff room. The home is in the Carlyle House, a 17-story residential co-op built with the famed Carlyle Hotel nearly a century ago. Residents have access to hotel-style perks, including room service and the hotel’s gym. Gubelmann was a college DJ who rediscovered her love of spinning in her 40s, following a divorce and a successful career heading Vie Luxe, a candle company that she founded, whose clients included designers like Carolina Herrera, Calvin Klein and Oscar de la Renta. Mad Marj now works at parties around the world where stars like Drake, Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé enjoy her sounds; she has opened for Cardi B, Katy Perry, Mary J. Blige and Rita Ora, among others. Emily Beare, of Core, repped Gubelmann in the apartment sale while Emily Chen, of Olshan Realty, repped the buyer. Neither Gubelmann nor the brokers could be reached for comment.
