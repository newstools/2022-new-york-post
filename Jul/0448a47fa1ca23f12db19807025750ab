The first look at Ana de Armas’ portrayal of  Marilyn Monroe is here. Netflix released the trailer for the upcoming NC-17-rated Monroe biopic “Blonde” Thursday, which follows the rise and demise of the world’s most famous sex symbol. Mostly filmed in black-and-white, the two-minute clip starts with a man knocking on Monroe’s dressing room, telling her it’s time to face the paparazzi storm outside. Dolled up in the starlet’s signature blond hairdo, de Armas blows a kiss into the mirror and forces a smile before pleasing the crowd. “I know you’re supposed to get used to it,” a troubled Monroe says of her skyrocketing fame, “but I just can’t.” A slow, haunting version of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” from the film “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” accompanies a montage of de Armas in some of Monroe’s most iconic outfits, including her pink dress from the same film, and the Halloween-worthy white halter dress from “The Seven Year Itch.” But the clip also foreshadows tragedy for the starlet — who died from an overdose at 36 in 1962 — including tantrums, a fire and a car crash. “Marilyn doesn’t exist. When I come out of my dressing room, I’m Norma Jeane,” de Armas says, referencing her birth name in Monroe’s trademark whisper in the dramatic trailer. “I’m still her when the camera’s rolling. Marilyn Monroe only exists on the screen.” Julianne Nicholson, Xavier Samuel and Evan Williams all star in the film while Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tracey Landon and Scott Robertson all serve as producers. On Wednesday, de Armas posted behind-the-scenes stills from the movie to Instagram, showing her freakishly similar resemblance to Monroe. “Blonde” premieres on Netflix Sept. 23.
