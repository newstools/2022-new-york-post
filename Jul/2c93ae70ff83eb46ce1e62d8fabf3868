Hollywood is coming to Bedford, New York. While Ben Affleck got hitched to Jennifer Lopez in Vegas, his best buddy Matt Damon was celebrating his recent $8.5 million property purchase in Westchester, The Post can report exclusively. The stone-and-clapboard colonial mansion comes with its own saltwater pool, a stream and spring-fed pond, hiking trails, boardwalks and rope bridges — all over 13½ acres. There’s even a tree house. Damon and his wife, Luciana Barroso, bought it through an LLC that shares a Santa Monica, California, address with Damon and Affleck’s Pearl Street Films, at 2401 Main St. Since growing up together as best friends in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Damon and Affleck went on to win Oscars for “Good Will Hunting,” which they wrote and starred in. They are currently working on a Nike film about a groundbreaking sneaker deal/athletic partnership between the shoe brand and Michael Jordan. Damon plays sneaker salesman/executive Sonny Vaccaro, while Affleck plays Nike co-founder Phil Knight. The film will also star Oscar-winner Viola Davis and actor Jason Bateman. The four-bedroom, 5½-bath colonial home is 7,190 square feet. Built in 2004 and renovated last year, it comes with an elegant layout. On the main level, all of the rooms open to covered stone terraces — including an open chef’s kitchen designed by Christopher Peacock. The main bedroom boasts an ensuite spa-like bathroom, gym and coffee bar, while a private porch and balcony overlook the stream and pond. The family-friendly grounds — and the couple do have four kids — also boast a greenhouse, an antique barn and a tennis court. The listing broker is David Turner of Compass, while Muffin Dowdle, of Ginnel Real Estate, repped the buyer.
