Tim “Sharky” Ward, who fled from Queensland, Australia for Thailand in 2009, has long been known for his bodybuilder physique. But in a recent photo which has been shared on TikTok, the former millionaire looks almost unrecognizable. “Sharky lost his size,” one user commented. The dramatic weight loss comes after Ward returned to the Gold Coast, a move which appears to be prompted by the pandemic. Ward became known as the “Shark of Papaya” and developed a cult-following among locals. He has amassed significant wealth at various times of his life, including owning at one stage three Lamborghinis in an incredible rise to fortune which began as an orphan in New Zealand. Part of this was due to the extreme interest rates he was known to charge on his loans – in some cases as much as 200 percent. There were reports Ward went to Thailand after learning of an Australian Federal Police investigation into his activities. Ward has openly admitted to sleeping with sex workers in Thailand and said he enjoyed how easy it was to pay off police on the island paradise. “I don’t have to wear a shirt. I don’t have to abide by the rules and if I do break the rules, I just pay,” he was quoted as saying previously. On his Facebook page, which has 60,000 followers, Ward says “I been flat broke and I been a multi millionaire. The happy place is definitely somewhere in between.” After growing up orphaned in New Zealand, Ward moved to Australia in 1990. This part of Ward’s upbringing has been credited with Ward’s well-known habit for feeding stray dogs on the streets of Papaya. Ward has signaled his desire to return to Thailand, but only once the country steps away from its vaccine requirements.
