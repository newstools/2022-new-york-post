Must be the new math. The NYPD revealed crime numbers for June. The city saw a 12 percent decline in shooting incidents year-to-date and released a statement. “We are encouraged by this downward trend in gun violence as summer gets underway.” Hmmm. The annual running of the bulls continues in Pamplona, Spain … and the bull is still running rampant here as well. More numbers that don’t add up: The Reds have won four in a row, and the Yankees have lost two straight. Cincinnati is at the Stadium. Gerrit Cole (8-2, 3.26 ERA) is on the hill. Cole won his last two games but allowed seven runs over those 12 innings. The Reds go with rookie Graham Ashcraft (4-2, 4.35). Graham cracked two starts back. Left Wrigley faster than Serena Williams left Wimbledon after seven runs scored but held firm, limiting the Mets to two runs next out. Taking a shot. Ten units on the road-dog Reds. Max Scherzer (one run, nine Ks, seven innings) outpitched Max Fried (two runs, five Ks, five innings) and the Mets chopped down the Bravos, 4-1. Up +1,711 harrelsons.
