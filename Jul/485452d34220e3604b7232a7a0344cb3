From inflation to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, there are plenty of reasons why Americans may feel stressed. A new study has found that some areas of the country are more stressed than others. On Monday, WalletHub published a report that found the most and least stressed cities in the U.S., based on work stress, financial stress, family stress and stress related to health and safety. For its report, WalletHub compared 182 cities – including the 150 most populated U.S. cities and at least two of the most populated cities in each state – based on 40 metrics. Aside from its overall ranking, WalletHub found how cities ranked within specific metrics. For example, WalletHub found that Reno, Nevada has the lowest job security, while Orlando, Florida, has the highest job security. Detroit, Michigan, was found to have the highest poverty level, while Pearl City, Hawaii, was found to have the lowest poverty rate. El Paso, Texas, was found to have the highest percentage of adults in fair or poor health, while Sioux Falls, South Dakota had the lowest. Meanwhile, two cities – Springfield, Missouri, and Birmingham, Alabama, – tied for the city with the highest crime rate. Port St. Lucie, Florida, was found to have the lowest crime rate.
