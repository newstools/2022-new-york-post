On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Marlins 3-2 and extended their winning streak to four games. What’s interesting about Pittsburgh is that it has the second-worst run differential (-124) despite being in third place in its division. Although that tells me the Pirates can be an all-or-nothing team, I can’t help but view them favorably, especially after watching them sweep the Dodgers on the road back in May. Teams can be very streaky in baseball, so you must strike while the iron is still hot. And with the Pirates amidst one of those streaks, I think they’re well worth a look as underdogs yet again. Odds provided by BetMGM Moneyline: PIT (+145) vs. MIA (-175) Spread: PIT +1.5 (-150) vs. MIA -1.5 (+125) Total: Over 7 (-105) | Under 7 (-115) JT Brubaker (4.34) vs. Pablo López (2.91) The Pirates opened as high as a +170 underdog, and we’ve seen a rush of sharp money on the visitors to push their odds down to +145. My model makes Pittsburgh’s odds no worse than +140, so there’s still some value that remains at the current price. While JT Brubaker might be 2-8 on the year with a 4.34 ERA, his advanced numbers suggest he’s been even better given his 3.91 FIP and 3.95 xERA. He’ll need to cut down on his walks (3.93 BB/9) for the Pirates to have a chance at winning this game. However, he might catch a break against this Miami team that has the sixth highest chase rate in the league at 34.2 percent. Brubaker could get the drop on this Marlins team as he’s yet to face them in his career. Only five players on Miami’s roster have ever stepped foot in the box against Brubaker, and they’re 1-for-5 in that limited sample size. If we turn to Pablo López, the Marlins right-hander is 6-4 with a 2.91 ERA. However, his advanced metrics point to some regression, evidenced by a 3.60 FIP and a 3.79 xERA. The Pirates are familiar with López, given their 19 plate appearances. A closer look reveals that Pittsburgh hit .333 with a .425 wOBA in those at-bats.   Moreover, Pittsburgh is having much better success at the plate of late. Over the past 14 days, the Pirates’ offense has an above-average wRC+ value of 106. Using the same metric, Miami ranks 29th with a below-average value of 74 during that span. With the NL East so competitive, I think there’s been a bit of a letdown with the Marlins when they step out of the division. Miami is 41-45 on the year but 24-16 within the division. However, in games outside the division, Miami is just 17-29 and 3-8 when facing teams in the NL Central. As for the Pirates, they’re 6-7 against teams in the NL East. The head-to-head numbers also favor the Pirates as they’re 4-1 in the past five meetings and 5-1 as visitors in Miami. I think we’re catching the Pirates in a decent spot as this plus-price is too good to pass up. While it looks like the market has finally settled, you can still find value on the road dogs at +140 or better. Pirates ML +145 (BetMGM)
