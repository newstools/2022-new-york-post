Mary Jane Thomas, the wife of country singer Hank Williams Jr., died from a collapsed lung just one day after having liposuction surgery, officials said. The 58-year-old former model was found unresponsive on March 22, just one day after undergoing the fat-removal procedure on her back, arms, and stomach, People reports. Her cause of death was ruled accidental, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner. Thomas, who lived in Nashville, traveled to Jupiter, Fla., for the procedure. She was released from the facility on March 21 and taken to a recovery facility nearby. There, Thomas became unresponsive while sitting upright in bed, according to the outlet. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A representative for Bafitis Plastic Surgery did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Thomas was married to singer Williams, 72, for over 30 years. After meeting in 1985 at one of Williams’ shows in Washington state, the pair tied the knot in 1990. The pair raised two children — daughter Katie Williams-Dunning and son Samuel Williams. Williams-Dunning died in 2020 in a car accident in Tennessee. Her husband, Tyler Dunning, was in the vehicle and survived with critical injuries. Mary Jane, who appeared alongside Williams Jr. when he was recently inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, is survived by the singer, their son, and three grandchildren.
