Buffalo Bills guard Rodger Saffold “injured some ribs” during a recent car accident, head coach Sean McDermott told reporters on Sunday, and he won’t be practicing with the team at the start of training camp. Saffold, 34, will be placed on the non-football injury list. The Bills signed Saffold to a one-year, $6.25 million contract in March after he was released by the Titans. Saffold earned his first Pro Bowl nod in 2021, his 12th year in the NFL. He spent the first nine years of his career with the Rams, who drafted him in the second round (33rd overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, $44 million deal with the Titans in 2019.
