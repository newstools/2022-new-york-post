Finders keepers still applies, right? A woman stumbled across a precious stone on Wednesday in Madhya Pradesh, India, in the village of Purusottampur. She was venturing out to gather firewood when she discovered the diamond. With the gem in hand, she ran home to tell her husband. At first, the couple couldn’t identify the sparkling stone and sought help from Anupam Singh, a diamond expert. Video footage shows the woman, named Genda Bai, dressed in a red sari and cradling the diamond in her fingers before giving it to an accompanying official. The gem weighed in at 4 carats and is estimated to be worth $25,067.66. The gem is set to be sold at an upcoming diamond auction, hopefully garnering some cash for Bai’s family, who live in dilapidated housing. Prior to her precious find, Bai sold firewood to afford repairs on her home, which she described as in very poor condition. She has four sons and two daughters who will soon be married, and with the money from her diamond discovery, Bai thinks she’ll earn enough funds for her daughters’ marriages. So far this year, a few noteworthy gemstones have been auctioned, including the largest fancy vivid blue diamond — also called the De Beers Cullinan Blue — which was sold at $57.47 million one year after its discovery. And in May, the largest white diamond ever auctioned, dubbed the Rock, was sold for $21.9 million and weighed in at 228.31 carats. On the same day as Bai’s find, the largest pink diamond found in 300 years was unearthed in Angola. Called the Lulo Rose, the 170-carat gem doesn’t have an estimated value just yet, but similarly sized rocks have sold at auction for millions. In 2017, the 59.6-carat Pink Star diamond was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million and still holds the record for the most expensive diamond.
