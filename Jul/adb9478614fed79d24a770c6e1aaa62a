Firefighters came to the rescue of a dog who had been cruelly thrown off a bridge into the Harlem River Tuesday afternoon. The FDNY Marine Unit 4 raced to the scene and found a Good Samaritan clinging to the canine from the shore in an attempt to keep his head above the water as he struggled to stay afloat. Firefighters were able to pull the white and brown pooch out of the busy waterway and onto the fireboat. They brought the dog ashore so he could get medical attention. “Without the quick response from both the civilian and FDNY members, the outcome for this animal could have been very different,” the FDNY said in a statement. The pup appears to be a Pitbull mix. The department didn’t have further information on the age or condition of the dog. A woman who works for the city and commented on the FDNY’s Instagram post about the rescue said the dog was brought to the Animal Care Center of Brooklyn and has already been adopted from the shelter. The FDNY was unable to confirm this.
