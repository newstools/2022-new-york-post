Nick Kyrgios and girlfriend Costeen Hatzi are having some fun on an island in the sun. Over the weekend, Hatzi shared a collection of snapshots from the couple’s tropical getaway to the Bahamas, days after Novak Djokovic defeated Kyrgios, 27, in the Wimbledon final. “A well deserved holiday,” the 22-year-old influencer captioned a recent Instagram post, geotagging Nassau as the pair’s locale, which is where Kyrgios is said to have a residence. In the photos, Kyrgios is seen lounging at the beach with Hatzi while catching some rays. A bikini-clad Hatzi is also photographed walking out of the water in a separate post. Kyrgios, who reached the Wimbledon final earlier this month for his first career grand slam final appearance, also gave fans a glimpse at his getaway with Hatzi. In an Instagram Story shared Sunday, Kyrgios can be seen leading the way as Hatzi follows on a bike. The Australian tennis star appeared to be in pleasant spirits following his 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3) loss to Djokovic on July 10. Hatzi went on to congratulate Kyrgios, whom she was first linked to late last year, in an Instagram tribute following the match. “Super proud. What an achievement, I love you so much,” Hatzi wrote on her Instagram story. Kyrgios’ recent run at Wimbledon wasn’t without controversy, as he was accused of assaulting his ex-girlfriend, Chiara Passari. News.com.au reported that he’s been charged with assault stemming from a Dec. 2021 incident. “ACT Policing can confirm a 27-year-old Watson man is scheduled to face the ACT Magistrates Court on the 2nd of August in relation to one charge of common assault following an incident in December 2021,” the authorities previously said. A common assault charge carries a maximum sentence of two years in jail. Lawyer Jason Moffett previously told the Canberra Times that Kyrgios “takes the allegation very seriously.”
