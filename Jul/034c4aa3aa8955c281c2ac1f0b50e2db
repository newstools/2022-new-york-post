Visitors to Las Vegas won’t even need to leave their hotel rooms to get a taste of Sin City. VR Bangers, a company that specializes in pornographic films specially tailored to three-dimensional virtual reality headsets, is partnering with several Vegas hotels to offer helmets pre-loaded with adult content to guests eager to indulge their need for instant gratification. Those who have booked rooms in the hotels will have the VR headsets delivered via robot. Daniel Abramovich, the CEO of VR Bangers, told Daily Star that hotels and resorts were initially resistant to the idea because they “don’t want to be associated with porn even though they show 18+ movies on their hotel TV, which is hypocrisy — because what’s the difference, right?” “The idea to use the robots changed everything,” Abramovich said. “Hotel rooms no longer have to store our VR porn, the service became completely voluntary, and still you can have your favorite VR sex scenes delivered if you don’t have your headset.” “We’ve even created some special scenes to ensure that they offer even greater levels of immersion and realism!” The VR headsets, the Oculus Quest 2 developed by Facebook parent company Meta, allow users to match the background with the hotel room in order to allow for total “immersion.” Guests pay $50 per day for the headset, which will be “fully sanitized.” So far, VR Bangers has deployed a fleet of five robots that will be used to deliver the helmets to customers. It is unclear which hotels are offering the VR porn headsets. The Post has sought comment from VR Bangers. The popularity of VR-based pornography has surged in recent years. It is estimated that VR porn has grown into a $1 billion industry, according to the Wall Street Journal. Unlike pornography that is viewed on television and computer screens, tablets, and phones, VR porn has the advantage of offering the user a near-real life experience that makes it seem more realistic.
