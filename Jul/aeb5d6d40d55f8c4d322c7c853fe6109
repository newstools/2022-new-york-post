And the nominees are … The 2022 Emmy Award nominees were announced Tuesday via livestream on the official Emmys website and Facebook page. Melissa Fumero, of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” and 2021 Emmy winner JB Smoove — who both star in the upcoming Netflix comedy “Blockbuster” — hosted the nomination reveal. “Succession” scored the top nods, with the HBO show earning 25 nominations across all categories, with “The White Lotus” and “Ted Lasso” tying for second place with 20 nods each. “Squid Game” also became the first non-English language series to be nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Drama after it captivated the nation. There were several other firsts with performers scoring their first nominations, including Chadwick Boseman (“What If…?”), Jennifer Coolidge (“The White Lotus”), Elle Fanning (“The Great”) and Andrew Garfield (“Under the Banner of Heaven”). For “Squid Game,” Jung Ho-yeon and Lee Jung-jae received nominations. Sydney Sweeney received two first-time nominations for “Euphoria” and “The White Lotus.” As for networks, HBO scored 140 nominations, up from the 130 it received last year. Netflix came in second place with 105, which marks a decrease from last year’s 129 nods. The 74th Emmy Awards take place Sept. 12, at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. Viewers can watch on NBC or Peacock, as well as other live streaming services Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, and Fubo TV, at 8 p.m. Cedric the Entertainer hosted the scaled down, socially distanced ceremony in 2021. In 2020, Jimmy Kimmel hosted to a theater full of cardboard cutouts because of the pandemic. No host for this year has been announced.
