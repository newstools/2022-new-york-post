It’s a good thing these prospective lawyers are going into a lucrative profession. The grub at the Javits Center for the upcoming two-day state bar exam comes at mind-boggling prices, with kosher meals costing more than $50. The majority of the boxed meals, which include  a sandwich, pasta salad, chips, a cookie and a bottle of water, will cost $33. The kosher turkey sandwich and kosher chicken wrap will set the would-be attorneys back a whopping $53 dollars. With tax, that’s $115.41 for both days of the exam. Teachers and students say the costs of the deli subs from the Javits Center’s catering group, Cultivated, are pushing it. “The kosher options are $20 more than the other already-absurdly priced meals,” Sean Silverman, a bar exam and LSAT tutor, told The Post. “Fifty-three bucks for a sandwich? It’s laughably expensive.” Test takers have limited options. They can’t bring backpacks into the exam room and are allowed only a beverage and quiet snack, which are unwrapped and in a clear food bag.
