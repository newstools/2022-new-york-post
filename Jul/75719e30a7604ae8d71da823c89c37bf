Two people were fatally stabbed in separate incidents in Queens and Harlem late Friday and early Saturday, police said. In the most recent incident, a 32-year-old man was stabbed in the head multiple times and a 32-year-old woman suffered cuts to her left arms during a dispute at the corner of 98th Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Corona, Queens at about 3:10 a.m. Saturday, police said. Both victims were transported to Elmhurst Hospital, where the man was pronounced dead and the woman was listed in stable condition, authorities said. A 20-year-old man who investigators suspect stabbed both victims with an unknown object outside of 38-27 98th Street was taken into custody. Charges were pending. Police did not reveal what fueled the dispute. Late Friday night in Harlem, a 35-year-old man was fatally stabbed inside a building on the 3,400 block of Broadway near West 139th Street, cops said. The victim, who was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the neck shortly after 11 p.m., was taken to Harlem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. Cops took a 61-year-old man into custody at the scene and recovered a knife. Charges are pending and “the investigation remains ongoing,” the NYPD said.
