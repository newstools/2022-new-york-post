Leighton Vander Esch lives on the edge. On a recent excursion to the northwest, the Cowboys linebacker shared a video of himself feeding a fish to a wild bear. “Definitely a couple firsts this weekend,” Vander Esch wrote on his Instagram. “Not often you get to feed a wild bear and get a picture with two sturgeon in the same frame. Amazing weekend with family making memories that will last a lifetime! Thank you @killgoreadventures for an awesome trip.” Killgore Adventures, the fishing and ATV rental firm that Vander Esch tagged, is based in Idaho. In a photo after the video, Vander Esch can be seen holding a gigantic sturgeon that was caught on the trip. Vander Esch, who made the Pro Bowl in his rookie season in 2018, is entering his fifth year in the NFL — all of which have been spent with the Cowboys. Last season, Vander Esch had 48 solo tackles, 29 assisted tackles, one sack, and one interception.
