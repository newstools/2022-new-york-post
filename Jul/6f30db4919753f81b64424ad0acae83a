The Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees have been named. Among the 17: Olympian Simone Biles, actor Denzel Washington, and me-first Megan Rapinoe. Bartolo Colon and Stitches will have to wait another year. Cleveland decided to push Tristan McKenzie back a day. He will throw Sunday against the Yankees. Instead of Nasty Nestor Cortes, his opponent will be Jordan Montgomery, who has been bailed out by the Bombers’ bats in his last two starts, allowing nine runs over 12 ²/₃ innings. Staying with McKenzie and the GuarIndians for 10 units. Let’s play two. Ross Stripling starts for Toronto. Ross has been boss, limiting opponents to six runs over his last 30 innings. The Rays are still north of the border. Shane Baz has done an admirable job filling the rotation. He has made four starts and after getting shelled in his initial outing he has allowed only two runs since. Taking the Blue Jays and Stripling for 20 units.  No game Saturday due to the pitching change. Holding at +1,572 bobfellers.
