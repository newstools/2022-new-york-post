New York City’s most expensive listing is back on the market — with a new brokerage firm in tow. The full-floor penthouse, last asking $169 million, is on the 96th floor of 432 Park Ave. on Billionaires’ Row. The sprawling six-bedroom, seven-bathroom skypad is a spacious 8,255 square feet. The seller is Fawaz Alhokair, a Saudi retail and real estate mogul, who plunked down $87.7 million for the trophy home in 2015. The swanky residence comes with a breakfast bar overlooking Central Park, a great room, a library, a fireplace, oak floors, marble counters, a grand piano — and views that never get old. In the past, the unit was marketed to crypto billionaire bros. But as Bitcoin tanks, that marketing strategy has changed. “The price will be on request,” broker Tal Alexander tells Gimme, who left Douglas Elliman to launch Official, a licensed brokerage, with his brother Oren. “We are listing it as price upon request as this asset is for a true collector,” Alexander added. “Like with anything rare — take a coveted piece of art, for example — it’s often referred to as priceless. The market determines its value. With some of these trophy assets, the price can eclipse the story of the offering itself. We want to avoid that.” Amenities at the luxury building are many. They include a lounge, a private restaurant, an outdoor terrace for dining and events, a 75-foot-indoor pool, a gym with a spa, a library, a screening room/performance venue and a yoga studio. There’s also room service and a concierge.
