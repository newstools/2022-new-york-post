Veronika Khomyn is reflecting on her longtime romance with Rams coach Sean McVay, one month after the couple tied the knot. On Monday, Khomyn posted a collection of photos on Instagram from her and McVay’s big day at The Beverly Hills Hotel that featured the newlyweds enjoying a few intimate moments together. “Love is a short word, easy to spell, difficult to define and impossible to live without,” Khomyn captioned the post. Khomyn, a realtor who specializes in luxury properties, wed McVay on June 4, about three years after getting engaged. McVay and his new bride were celebrated by several members of the Rams family, including wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who crashed the lavish affair. Later on Monday, Khomyn gushed over her bridal party, whom she dubbed her “dream team.” “My bridesmaids, sisters, hype women, ride or dies. My dream team,” she wrote on Instagram. Since their extravagant celebrations last month, McVay and Khomyn have been living it up ahead of the Rams’ training camp. Last week, a video surfaced on social media that featured the 36-year-old coach balancing on a hoverboard in the middle of the water. McVay is gearing up for his sixth season with the Rams, whom he coached to a Super Bowl title in February over the Bengals. Khomyn cheered on her then-future husband at SoFi Stadium, where Los Angeles topped Cincinnati, 23-20. “I’ve watched this guy grind nonstop. Day in and day out. No breaks. He always puts everyone else first, and winning this Lombardi trophy for his team, his family, his friends… is a dream come true!!! I love you babe, you deserve this times a million. Victory tastes pretty damn good,” she gushed on Instagram at the time. The Rams will open the season at home against the Bills on Thursday, Sept. 8.
