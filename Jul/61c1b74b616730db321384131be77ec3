An arena football game between the West Texas Warbirds and Dallas Prime ended in a massive fight that sprawled into the stands on Saturday night. The incident took place at Odessa’s Ector County Coliseum and was captured on video. The videos show the fight taking place in one of the end zones and eventually spilling out toward the fans. It was here that someone from the stands was seen with a folding chair, which they used to strike a Dallas Prime player on the back of the helmet. This triggered a response from Dallas teammates, who went up into the stands and began punching the fan. Warbirds president Leif Kertis called the incident “embarrassing, regrettable, and inexcusable,” in a statement to the Midland Reporter Telegram. Kertis added that the organization is working with local authorities. “We are confident that once details emerge many items will be cleared up. We can confirm that as of right now no Warbirds players, coaches, or staff are subjects of the investigations,” Kertis said. Kertis also was sure to make it known that the fan who used the folding chair “is not, and has never been part of our organization in any capacity.” “No matter where fault, blame, or culpability lies we owe the people of the Permian Basin an apology. You should never be concerned for your safety or your child’s safety at our games. We are taking the appropriate steps to mitigate any possibility of reoccurrence in future seasons by working with the Coliseum and ECSO on improved proactive measures as well as response management,” Kertis said. KOSA, the CBS affiliate in the Odessa area, believes the brawl lasted upwards of 10 minutes. Players, coaches, fans and even one of the mascots got in on the action. No injuries or arrests have been reported as of Sunday. The investigation is still underway.
