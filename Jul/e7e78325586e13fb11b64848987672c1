All is right for the Warriors coming off another NBA title, at least for now. Starting Aug. 3, Draymond Green is eligible for a new 4-year extension with Golden State and he wants the maximum deal, according to Anthony Slater and Marcus Thompson II of the Athletic. Unfortunately for Green, it appears that the Warriors have no desire to offer him a max offer and, as a result, extension talks have fizzled. Green has a $27.5 million player option which he can exercise for 2023-24, and the Warriors would rather discuss an extension during that time. Per the report, the Warriors’ hesitation appears to be less about their view on Green’s value and more about their typical timetable on extensions. In the past, they typically have waited until there is one year left on a player’s deal before offering a max extension. Though Green still has two years remaining on his current deal, he can opt-out of that contract before the final year, which could force the Warriors’ hand. If the Warriors don’t offer the max to Green, according to Slater and Thompson, there’s a chance he could explore other options to land the deal he wants. Green also currently has a 15 percent trade kicker if the Warriors move him. There’s also a chance the Warriors could anger Steph Curry if they decide not to keep Green, per Slater and Thompson. If the Warriors do find a way to keep Green, along with Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole, according  to the report, Golden State would be looking at spending near $200 million in luxury taxes by 2024 and $400-500 million in total, something that wouldn’t sit well with owner Joe Lacob.
