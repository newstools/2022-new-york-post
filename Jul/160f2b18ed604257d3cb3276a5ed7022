Model Kelly Kay has paid tribute to her “everything,” late Oregon Ducks tight end Spencer Webb. In a post shared Thursday on Instagram, Kay shared a collection of photos that featured herself and Webb, who died tragically on Wednesday at the age of 22 in an apparent diving accident. “My best friend my twin flame the love of my life,” Kay wrote in the caption. “I’ve never loved anything as much as i love you. You were my everything, you gave me purpose, you showed me what it’s like to be cherished and valued and seen for me.” Kay continued to portray Webb as someone who was selfless. “We had so many big plans. I don’t know where to go from here but I know you’ll be watching over me keeping me strong,” she wrote. “You always put everybody else before yourself and I’ll try to hold the same kindness in my heart  from this life to the next one baby I love you so much and I’ll find you again .” In an Instagram Story from Thursday, Kay wrote, “What I would give to be in your arms one more time.” Although it’s unclear when the couple began dating, they appeared to make their relationship Instagram official this past week. On Tuesday, Webb posted a series of photos with the caption, “Made her fall in love with the kid…” Two years ago, Kay ran onto the field during Super Bowl 2020 between the Chiefs and 49ers in Miami. “Do what you want, when you want, life’s too short to have regrets  Thanks @nfl for having me ” she wrote afterward on social media. In the wake of Webb’s death, Oregon coaches and players have posted heartfelt messages on social media.
