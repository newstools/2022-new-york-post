Chris Russo took the barb in stride. Although Stephen A. Smith is out on vacation, the Mad Dog made his customary weekly appearance on ESPN’s “First Take” on Wednesday. Russo was embroiled in a debate about Kevin Durant with Domonique Foxworth, a former NFL defensive back who was once the president of the NFLPA. Russo didn’t like the idea that Durant, who has four years remaining on his contract with the Nets, could have his trade request indulged. “[Let’s say] I sign a long-term contract with ESPN, and then in two weeks Fox comes to me. Well, I can’t go! I signed a contract with ESPN!” Russo barked. Foxworth explained that the distinction comes down to leverage. “I can tell you the difference: You’re Chris ‘Mad Dog’ Russo. You have a certain amount of value. You are not no damn Kevin Durant,” he said. “Your value is not that. You are not LeBron James. You ain’t none of them dudes.” Foxworth did acknowledge that Russo is not without his value in the sports media business. “You have more power and leverage than I do, but I’m not gonna get over here and complain that Mad Dog’s allowed to do stuff that I’m not allowed to do — because I’m not as valuable as you!” Foxworth said. “Get out of Kevin Durant’s way. You ain’t him. These guys are one-of-a-kind, exceptional once-in-a-lifetime athletes who are having their salaries artificially suppressed [by salary caps and max contracts in the NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement].” In these debates, Russo typically plays the populist role while getting “roasted” by recently retired athletes who defend their modern counterparts’ right to wield whatever leverage they may have.
