The world was hooked by the sexy period drama “Bridgerton” when it was released on Netflix in 2020, but how many can say they conceived a child because of it? Clare Reilly found herself hooked on the show —  which starred Regé-Jean Page as the Duke of Hastings and Phoebe Dynevor as Daphne Bridgerton in the first season — cheekily telling The Sun her husband enjoyed her as a result of her loving the series. “The Duke especially got me really hot under the collar — and then my husband got to enjoy the benefits in the bedroom,” she said. Reilly said she surprised by how graphic the sex scenes were — especially for a period drama. “There are lots of scenes with male characters pleasuring the female characters which is a refreshing change to what we normally see on screen,” she said. When she found out she was pregnant again, Reilly said she was shocked but excited. “I’ll tell Felicity when she’s older that she’s our Bridgerton baby,” she said. Reilly wasn’t the only one who said the show got them in the mood for some late night fun,  with Abi Kay telling The Sun the series is to thank for her baby girl. “Our baby girl is here because watching the show helped me change how I was feeling about sex,” she said. “I’ll always be grateful to it for helping me conceive. Who knows if Season 3 will bring us Bridgeton baby number two?” The first season of the series began streaming in December. There was a spike in births in September, October and November in the UK, according to the Office for ­National Statistics. In the US, the National Center for Health Statistics recorded a jump in births in 2021 for the first time in seven years.
