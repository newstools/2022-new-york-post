Prices aren’t the only thing subject to inflation at Walmart. The mega-retailer is now selling a new line of adult products, all for under $20 each on their online store. Products from Justin Sayne’s “fetish mafia” line are now available to Walmart customers who shop online. The products include his “insanity” male enhancement pills,  the “Weinerschleiden” and “d-AZ” lubricants, and “body bag” condoms. Justin Sayne told AVN that he is selling his products at Walmart to increase brand awareness and support brick and mortar retailers. “The sheer visibility of Fetish Mafia products on the website reaches millions of people which, in turn, supports consumers who may also shop at local adult stores,” Sayne said. Sayne says he deliberately priced the items he’s selling at Walmart so they wouldn’t compete with mom-and-pop adult stores. “I intentionally priced everything at MSRP — or manufacturers suggested retail price – and did not lower my prices in order not to compete with brick-and-mortar stores,” Sayne said. Sayne launched the “Fetish Mafia” brand in Arizona in 2018, and sells a variety of adult products. Walmart sells sex toys and other adult products from different companies as well, it is unclear if Sayne’s products will be sold in stores or just online.
