The city wants a lot of green for a damaged tree in Queens. A pin oak on a leafy street in Kew Gardens sustained a whopping $199,950 worth of damage, the city contends in a lawsuit against the woman who owns the home near the tree, and a Brooklyn-based concrete company. The city-owned sidewalk tree, which was 40 inches in diameter and estimated to be 80 to 100 years old, had its roots cut and needs to be removed, the city Parks Department said. The tree at 113 82nd Ave was damaged in July 2019, according to a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit filed against Zulema Santos, 73, and Bissoon Inc. Records show Santos sold the 82nd Avenue home last year for more than $1.2 million. Pin oaks can grow 60 to 70 feet tall, and take 15 years to reach maturity. Several factors play into the monetary value of city trees, according to the Parks Department, including their size, species, longevity, condition and location, with oaks being among the top-rated city trees. The city takes into account the size, species, condition and location of trees to determine their value. Many of the trees on 82nd Avenue are “coming to the end of their useful life,” said Adam Whiteman, vice president of the Kew Gardens Civic Association, who lives on the block and added, “there are lots of dead branches which are ready to fall.” Santos declined comment. Bissoon didn’t reply to a message seeking comment.
