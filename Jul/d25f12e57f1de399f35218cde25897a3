The suddenly catching-desperate Mets have added a backstop ahead of the trade deadline, but not the one from Chicago or the one from Triple-A Syracuse. On Saturday, the Mets traded for fifth-year catcher Michael Perez in a second trade with the Pirates in as many days, though this one less notable than acquiring Daniel Vogelbach. It’s Perez, not the Cubs’ Willson Contreras (at least not yet) or Francisco Alvarez (at least not yet), who comes to Queens for cash considerations after the Mets have lost their two primary catchers. James McCann is sidelined for weeks with an oblique strain, and Tomas Nido left Friday’s loss with a hand contusion suffered on a cross-up with Max Scherzer, who hit Nido in the left wrist. Nido exited the game “pretty sore,” manager Buck Showalter said. The Mets have not announced anything further on Nido’s status. Without their top two catchers, only Patrick Mazeika is healthy and on the active roster. Perez, a 29-year-old from Puerto Rico, was designated for assignment Friday after hitting .150 with six home runs in 39 games with Pittsburgh. He has bounced between the minors and majors since 2018, his first three seasons with the Rays. Infielder Travis Blankenhorn, who had been called up Friday, was designated for assignment.
