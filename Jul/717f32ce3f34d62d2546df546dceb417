For the fourth time in the past seven years, there is a sense something different is approaching as the Giants prepare to open training camp in two weeks. Indeed, for the fourth time in the past seven years, training camp will be orchestrated by a new head coach. On July 27, Brian Daboll will welcome in the Giants for what will be more than five months of non-stop meetings, workouts, practices, walk-throughs, media sessions, film study and games. There will, of course, be many similarities to how Daboll structures his first NFL camp as the man in charge with those who came before him. There are necessities that must be incorporated into every camp: Practice time. Weight training. Meals. Rest and recovery time. Daboll, like any coach, is sure to tweak things, because everything about the precise, minute-by-minute schedule of an NFL training camp represents and reflects the painstaking detail all prospective head coaches prepare for, planning for the day when they get the opportunity to run their own team. Based on wholly unscientific research — communicating with a random sampling of Giants fans the past few months — there is a stronger-than-usual sense of optimism for what Daboll can install and instill in this team. It’s not so much that there is rampant agreement that the 2022 Giants will be a contender, but there is no small measure of confidence that Daboll — and new general manager Joe Schoen — will bring stability and order to the franchise.
