Evie Evans, 8, was excited to go to an amusement park over Fourth of July weekend — but ended up with 10 stitches on her face. At Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, Evie went on the Twisted Colossus roller coaster with her mother, Della White. On the ride, she was hit between her eyes by an object, which turned out to be a cellphone. White told Fox 11 that Evie’s face was bleeding badly and when she tried to tell a ride attendant, they ignored her. “It was really scary,” Evie told NBC Los Angeles. “I was screaming and crying.” It wasn’t until a fellow passenger told them that they saw a phone fly out of another rider’s hands that they realized what had hit her head. White’s other daughter, Eden, said a man came up to them after the incident looking for his cellphone, reportedly telling them to “stop freaking out” and that it wasn’t “a big deal.” But he quickly left after seeing Evie’s injury. Evie’s father, Josh Evans, said they handed the cellphone over to Six Flags employees and tried to file a report with the local police. However, he was shocked to find out “no crime was committed” so no action would be taken. “You are not supposed to leave” the scene of an accident, Evans told NBC LA. “I thought it was illegal, just like a hit-and-run.” Six Flags told Fox 11 the park’s policy “strictly prohibits all loose articles on rides,” and that “guests must follow all written and verbal instructions for safe riding.” “I guess it was a friendly way to say that they are not taking responsibility for what happened,” Evans said. The Post has reached out to Six Flags for comment.
