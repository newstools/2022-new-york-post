Joey Chestnut acknowledged Tuesday he doesn’t “feel too great” a day after hoovering up 63 hot dogs while cruising to victory in the annual Nathan’s Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest — but downplayed the post-binge bloat, saying it’s similar to the routine soreness other athletes experience. “I probably smell like meat,” the 38-year-old quipped to the hosts of NBC’s “Today.” “I don’t feel too great, but it’s like anything, a marathon runner doesn’t feel too great after a marathon,” added the perennial champion of chomp. “It will take me a day and a half to recover.” Chestnut recorded a record-setting 15th victory at the Independence Day competition Monday. While he trounced the fellow competitive eaters, the 63 franks he wolfed down was below the 76 he guzzled last year — perhaps in part because he momentarily halted his hot dog consumption to fight off an animal rights protester who stormed the Coney Island stage in the middle of the competition. The day after his 2021 win, Chestnut told The Post his clothes fit a little “snug,” and that he had “crazy dreams” reminiscent of the 2010 Christopher Nolan movie “Inception.” In a Tuesday morning phone interview, Chestnut said he didn’t get enough quality shut-eye to recall any visions. “I was having a hard time sleeping last night. I don’t remember any crazy dreams last night,” the California native told The Post. “It wasn’t the best sleep.” Miki Sudo — who on Monday earned her eighth victory in nine years in the women’s competition by devouring 40 hot dogs — told the hosts of NBC’s morning show that she feels “puffy” and “a little bloated.”
