As the Brooklyn Nets look to ship off the pieces from their failed ‘big three’ experiment, another trio in the NBA is looking to ensure they don’t follow suit. LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook reportedly met with one another to get on the same page and ensure last year’s disappointing season wasn’t repeated, according to Yahoo Sports. The Los Angeles Lakers’ big three held a phone call at the start of this year’s NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, during which each player pledged their joint devotion to the team and desire to right the ship, according to the report. The meeting comes on the heels of an influx of rumors surrounding Westbrook’s murky future with the Lakers. The 33-year-old is set to earn $47 million during the 2022-’23 season before he hits the free agent market next summer. Westbrook’s name has been thrown into the trade mix in recent weeks as the Nets could be looking to part ways with their disgruntled point guard, Kyrie Irving. The deal would not only rid Los Angeles of Westbrook’s lofty one-year contract, but also reunite the once-dominant tandem of James and Irving. Despite entering the 2021-22 season with championship expectations, the Lakers and their newly acquired Big 3 struggled mightily, ultimately missing out on the playoffs. The blame for their lackluster performance largely fell on the shoulders of Westbrook, who struggled to produce consistent play throughout the year. Following the disappointing season, Los Angeles parted ways with head coach Frank Vogel in favor of Darvin Ham. The new sideline general has frequently advocated for Westbrook this offseason, harping on the point guard’s vital role with the team this upcoming season. As for Westbrook, the former MVP has made some changes of his own, firing longtime agent Thad Foucher over “irreconcilable differences” last week.
