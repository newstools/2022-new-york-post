Rafael Nadal’s chance at a calendar Grand Slam is still alive. Nadal, who won the Australian Open and French Open earlier this year, battled through an abdominal injury in the Wimbeldon quarterfinals Wednesday to outlast American Taylor Fritz, 3-6, 7-5, 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (10-4). Nadal advances to a semifinal match against Nick Kyrgios. The 36-year-old left the court in the middle of the second set to get treatment. He was clearly laboring with his movement and service velocity throughout the match. The injury has been nagging him in recent days. Nonetheless, after defeating Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp on Monday, Nadal did not want to talk about it. “I am a little bit tired to talk about my body,” he told reporters after the match. “It’s not about that I don’t want to answer your question, but in the same time sometimes, I am tired about myself, all the issues that I am having. I prefer to not talk about that now. Sorry for that. “But I am in the middle of the tournament and I have to keep going, no? All respect for the rest of the opponents. I am just trying my best every single day. For the moment I am healthy enough to keep going and fight for the things that I want.”
