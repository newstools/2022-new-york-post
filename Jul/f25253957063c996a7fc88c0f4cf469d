Major League Baseball returns from its all-star break with a limited, six-game slate. For expert bettors they’re targeting two specific matchups. All the information about to be presented is drawn from the Action Network PRO Report, which provides betting percentages and five “signals” — sharp money, big money, PRO systems, model edge, and expert picks — that help distinguish certain plays. Today’s report sees two sides trigger at least a majority of the above signals. So, without further delay, let’s dive into the report’s recommendations. This will be the second game of a doubleheader between these sides today, and experts are interested in the hosts. We’ve seen sharp action hit the Astros moneyline, which opened at a consensus -115 price and has since ticked up to between -118 and -125 at most shops. Additionally, big money bettors are interested in the Astros as well — as of this writing, Houston has seen only 44 percent of all bets against 75 percent of the total handle. Finally, one top MLB betting expert from The Action Network is supporting the Astros to give them three total signals in their direction.
