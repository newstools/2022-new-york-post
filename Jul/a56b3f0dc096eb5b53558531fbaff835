Jordan Montgomery’s Subway Series start ended way earlier than he wanted. The Yankees starter was pulled in the third inning against the Mets on Tuesday night and admitted that he “sucked” in giving up five runs, including four in the first inning. The left-hander said he deserved to be yanked after the 6-3 loss, but in real-time, YES Network play-by-play man Michael Kay said he thought Montgomery was frustrated with the decision. “That’s going to do it. How about that?” a surprised Kay said on the broadcast. “Aaron Boone wants to stop the bleeding… And Montgomery is staring at him like he cannot believe he’s coming out to get him. He really looked right at him as if to say, ‘really.’” Kay concluded his thoughts after the commercial break. “Montgomery is a really chill dude and he was really angry that Boone took him out,” the longtime voice of the team said. Montgomery had just struck out Mark Canha for the first out of the third inning, but the Mets still had runners on first and second and were threatening to blow open what was already a 5-2 advantage. “I wanted to be out there, but I sucked. Obviously, I needed to be pulled,” Montgomery said after the 71-pitch outing that saw his ERA go up to 3.50. YES Network analyst David Cone agreed with the decision by Boone — saying it was a chance to “protect” the 29-year-old. Cone also agreed that Montgomery had an incredulous reaction to the decision. “He can’t believe it. ‘What’s going on? Why?’ There was no discussion before the move was made. A little discussion after Aaron Boone made the move, but not much,” Cone said. Ron Marinaccio replaced Montgomery and got a freak double play on a Francisco Lindor running blunder to end the inning. The bullpen kept the Yankees in it, but they were unable to rally against Mets starter Taijuan Walker and relievers Adam Ottavino and Edwin Diaz.
