A sixth man indicted in the infamous Central Park Five rape case is expected to have his conviction thrown out Monday — two decades after the exoneration of his co-defendants. Steven Lopez, who as a teenager reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to a lesser charge of robbing a male jogger, is due in court Monday afternoon for a hearing to vacate his case, following an expected motion to dismiss from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Lopez, now 48, was arrested along with five other black and Latino teens in the horrific 1989 rape and beating of then-28-year-old white jogger Trisha Meili. The attack, which left Meili in a coma for 12 days, shook the city at a time of high crime and fears of urban decay. His co-defendants — who became known as the Central Park Five — were ultimately convicted at trial and served six to 13 years in prison before their exoneration in 2002. The convictions were tossed after a nine-month review of the case uncovered significant evidence that was not provided to the jury during the initial trial, including DNA that linked serial rapist Matias Reyes to the crime. Reyes also confessed to the attack and said he committed it alone, but the statement came after the statute of limitations expired. The five sued the city in 2003 for $250 million over their wrongful conviction and imprisonment. Their lawsuit dragged on for more than a decade as then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg opposed striking a deal with the men, a stance later reversed by Mayor Bill de Blasio. City Hall paid $41 million to settle the suit in 2014. The case sparked the critically acclaimed Ken Burns documentary, “The Central Park Five” in 2012 and the 2019 Netflix dramatization “When They See Us.” Lopez — who served about three years in prison before being released in the early 1990s — has not received any settlements for his wrongful prosecution. His case has largely been forgotten since he pleaded guilty to robbery in 1991 to avoid the rape charge. With Post wires
