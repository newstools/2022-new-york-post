Should the Warriors emerge as a potential suitor in the Kevin Durant sweepstakes, the mother of a certain Golden State superstar doesn’t appear to be against a reunion. In the wake of Durant’s bombshell trade request out of Brooklyn last week, several teams have emerged as potential landing spots, with recent reports even linking the 12-time NBA All-Star to his former home in Golden State. Although that possibility hasn’t been warmly received by some fans, Draymond Green’s mother, Mary Babers-Green, believes athletes should play “wherever you want!” “This stuff is hilarious…. Everyone saying who don’t want one of the greatest players to ever play the game!” Babers-Green tweeted Monday, sans specifics. “I wouldn’t care what a spectator/commentator say period! Basketball players play basketball! GO PLAY! Wherever you want!” Durant played for Golden State from 2016 through 2019, winning two titles with the Warriors. He signed with the Nets in June 2019 and asked for a trade three years later. ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski likened the Rudy Golbert-to-the-Timberwolves trade package as a possibility of what it may cost for Durant’s services. “The Rudy Gobert trade to Minnesota started to frame that [package],” Wojnarowski said Monday on “SportsCenter.” “Essentially five first-round picks for Gobert, I think for Brooklyn, that level of picks, pick swaps, teams can do four, and then an All-Star level player.” The Suns and Heat are reportedly among Durant’s preferred destinations. He has yet to be traded as of Wednesday. The Warriors, meanwhile, are riding high following their NBA title win in June — their fourth in eight years.
