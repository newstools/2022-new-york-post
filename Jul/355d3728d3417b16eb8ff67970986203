Lakers governor Jeanie Buss took to Twitter on Sunday night to send a cryptic message to… someone. Was it LeBron James, the team, or the fans? It is unknown who this was actually meant for but we only truly know one thing: she misses Kobe Bryant. “I miss KB,” she wrote, in reference to the late Lakers great, Kobe Bryant who died in a helicopter crash in January of 2020. “He would understand and explain everything that I’m not allowed to,” she continued. “Honestly he was the greatest Laker ever. He understood team over self. Meaning your rewards would come if you valued team goals over your own then everything would fall into place. All can reply.” Just who she’s looking for a reply from, however, is up for debate. It could be meant for LeBron James who is a free agent next season. Perhaps it is a message for impending free agent and highest-paid player, Russell Westbrook who still struggles to consistently hit a jump shot despite being in the league for 14 seasons. It could be a message to the fans who want to compete for a title this season more than anyone. On “The Herd” with Colin Cowherd, Fox Sports’ Ric Bucher dove into the tweet to see the true meaning. They agreed that Buss is signaling to Kyrie Irving, who is training in Los Angeles these days, according to Bucher. “Those around the Lakers that I know believe this is setting the table for Kyrie Irving on the Lakers,” Bucher said. “You are the leader of this franchise, don’t give anyone the impression that there is anything you can’t solve and wish Kobe was here to solve.” If this is truly her way of speculating an Irving move is imminent, the Lakers immediately become one of the most chaotic and interesting teams in NBA history. The Buss family and the entire LA front office will have plenty of work to do to get ready to win a title this season after missing the playoffs last year.
