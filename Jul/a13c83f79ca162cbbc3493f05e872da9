An Upper East Side man has been arrested on an attempted murder charge in the vicious stabbing of a Chase Bank security guard in Manhattan, police sources said. Jorge Santiago, 34, was collared by the NYPD warrant squad on Einstein Loop in the Bronx at 12:30 a.m. Saturday, the sources said. Santiago was brought to the 19th Precinct, where he requested a lawyer when investigators began questioning him, the sources said. Santiago allegedly had two knives at the time of his arrest, but it was not immediately known if the weapons were the same used in the Friday attack, the sources said. The Manhattan DA’s office was expected to execute a search warrant for Santiago’s East 96th Street apartment, the sources said. Santiago was charged with attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, the sources said. In April 2013, Santiago was arrested for slashing another man across the face with a box cutter in the Bronx, the sources said. The victim was treated for his wounds at Jacobi Medical Center. The disposition of that case was not immediately available. In the latest incident, Santiago allegedly visited the Chase Bank on East 86th Street near Second Avenue before it opened and initially demanded the guard let him in, the sources said. He then left and came back later, only to become unhinged when he was later told the services he needed had to be done by phone, cops and law-enforcement sources said. The guard was escorting the man out of the bank just after 9 a.m. when he whipped out a blade and plunged it into the guard’s neck while the two were in the vestibule, cops said. The guard was in stable condition at Weill Cornell Medical Center, police said on Saturday.
