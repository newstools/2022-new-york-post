She’s not dressing to impress. A nurse says she can’t catch a break online after being trolled on the internet for her hip-hugging scrubs that are deemed “inappropriate.” Erika Diaz, 22, showed off her medical uniform, which clearly defined her shapely figure and subsequently went viral on TikTok. In the clip, which amassed 12.7 million views, Diaz stands in front of her camera in her scrubs, hitting back at people who call it “inappropriate” for work. The video then cuts to images of how the scrubs are advertised online, proving her body has different proportions than the women in the photos. “Some people just have an issue with my body not my scrubs and it shows,” her caption read. “Just for clarification I am 5’2” and 107 lbs I’m short and little, y’all can say my body is fake all y’all want it’s not,” she wrote in a follow-up comment, “ask my back problems.” “I literally work 2 jobs, volunteer and I am still studying I’m devoting my life to the improvement of others and anyone’s opinions are irrelevant,” she added. Diaz defended herself against the critics who suggested her outfit wasn’t “professional” and that she should just buy a “bigger” size. “You simply can buy a 1 bigger size to give you space for breath,” commented one person. “I’m an old school director. I’d never allow that on my floor — I don’t want to see nails perfum or style — keep that at home where it belongs,” griped another. But her others followers had her back, advocating for her to flaunt what she’s got without judgment. “She can’t help it that she’s snatched, let a fine woman live,” wrote one user. “Can’t change what you have, doesn’t make it inappropriate,” chimed in another. “Y’all wouldn’t have a problem with it if she had A cups,” stated another viewer. “I ain’t remember the last time I cared what a NURSE looks like when they’re helping me … regardless if you’re a patient or an employee,” argued someone else.
