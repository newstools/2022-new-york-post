The stars chose not to align for a jackpot winner on Tuesday. The Mega Millions winning jackpot numbers were: 2, 31, 32, 37, 70. The Mega Ball number was 25. The next Mega Millions jackpot has grown to an estimated $630 million. No one was fortunate enough to win the jackpot of an estimated $555 million, but others still arguably got a good deal with the second-place prize. Four lucky ticket holders each won a substantial sum of $1 million. None of them, however, hit the megaplier that would have awarded them $3 million. The four second-place prize tickets were sold in Arizona, California, North Carolina and New Hampshire. The most recent Mega Millions jackpot winner received $20 million from a ticket purchased in Pegram, Tennessee over three months ago, on April 15. A cash option of $359.7 million is also available for prospective winners of the next Mega Millions jackpot. The drawing will be on Friday, July 22 at 11 p.m. EST.
