Three men were shot when gunfire broke out in Brooklyn Wednesday morning, cops said. The men were wounded when bullets flew in front of 1115 Rutland Road in Brownsville around 11:30 a.m., cops said. A 37-year-old was shot in his lower back and a 34-year-old was shot in his left buttock, cops said. They were taken to Brookdale Hospital. A 33-year-old was shot in his left hip and taken to Kings County Hospital. All of them were expected to survive. Three male suspects fled north on Rutland Avenue in a black SUV, police said. The three victims all have extensive criminal records, police sources said. The gun violence came hours after Mayor Eric Adams vowed to “think outside the toolbox” with other local elected officials to reduce gun violence amid a spate of Big Apple shootings. Adams made his comments a day after two teen boys were shot — one fatally — in what police believe was a targeted incident in East Harlem.
