A stranger brutally beat a pregnant woman with a wrench in a broad-daylight Bronx attack that cops say may have stemmed from road rage, shocking video released early Friday shows. The footage – released by the NYPD – shows the suspect confronting the 26-year-old woman in the middle of the street on Grand Concourse near East Fordham Road around 5:20 p.m. Monday, and pushing her up against a parked car. He can then be seen repeatedly whacking the victim in the head with the metal tool. He later got into a silver BMW as a crowd gathered, some surrounding the injured victim. The attacker took off in the BMW, and the victim was taken to St. Barnabas in stable condition, with a severe cut on her head. Police say they are investigating whether road rage was the motive behind the attack. Cops were still looking for the attacker Friday.
