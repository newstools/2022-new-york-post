Dana White has apparently had enough Jake Paul talk. White had been on vacation for much of the summer but returned on Saturday to questions surrounding Paul’s boxing match against Hasim Rahman Jr. on Aug. 6 at Madison Square Garden. “Is this still a thing? It’s not to me,” White said. “He’s a pay-per-view turd.” In response to a follow-up question about whether he could ever welcome Paul to the UFC, White said: “I would never say never, but it’s the last f–king thing I am thinking about.” White and Paul have gone back and forth for months. Paul has continually taken jabs at White for fighter pay issues and lack of health insurance for fighters, something that has particularly upset White. Paul even made a diss track that has over four million views on YouTube, where he accuses White of cocaine use. At one point, Paul offered to join the UFC and fight welterweight Jorge Masvidal if he agreed to an extensive list of demands all centered around fighter pay going up.
