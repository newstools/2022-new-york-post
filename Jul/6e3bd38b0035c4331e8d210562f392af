JJ Watt and wife Kealia Ohai are enjoying some R&R on a beach before their baby arrives this fall. On Tuesday, the Arizona Cardinals defensive end shared a series of Instagram photos featuring his pregnant wife — a forward for the Chicago Red Stars of the NWSL — during what appeared to be a romantic vacation at an undisclosed location. “Hang it in the Louvre,” Watt wrote, adding a few heart-eye emojis in the caption of a bikini photo that featured Ohai showing off her growing baby bump by a pool. Watt, 33, also shared a number of bikini snaps of his soccer player wife walking along the beach near the ocean. The couple — who tied the knot in the Bahamas over Valentine’s Day weekend two years ago — posed for a selfie together while walking on the sand. Watt and Ohai announced in early June that they are expecting their first child together, sharing the exciting news through matching social media posts. “Could not be more excited,” Watt wrote at the time, adding that Ohai is due sometime in October. The couple is said to be expecting a baby boy, per ESPN’s Josh Weinfuss. First linked in 2016, Watt and Ohai announced their engagement three years later before tying the knot in early 2020. Watt is entering his second year with the Cardinals, whom he signed with in March 2021 following his release from the Texans after 10 seasons. He was sidelined for much of his debut campaign with Arizona due to a shoulder injury.
