Aaron Rodgers’ new tattoo is still the talk of the internet two days later. On Wednesday, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, 38, unveiled the ink on Instagram, which features astrological signs and lions, among other elements, on his forearm. Though Rodgers vowed to elaborate “a little more” on the piece one day, online sleuths have noticed similarities between his body art and that of his rumored girlfriend, Blu of Earth. SideAction.com recently called attention to a tattoo Blu shared on Instagram in 2019, which features drawings similar to that of Rodgers’ ink. What’s more, the design was crafted by the same tattoo artist Rodgers used, Balazs Bercsenyi. “An initiation. A return to truth. A stand for unconditional love. A right of passage. A reclaiming of my own body,” Blu wrote at the time. “Thank you to my soul brother @balazsbercsenyi for adorning my vessel with your light.” Rodgers, who is gearing up for his 18th NFL season, was first linked to Blu last month, two months after calling it quits with Shailene Woodley, his former fiancée. Though reports identified Blu as a “witch,” she shot down those allegations in a series of Instagram Stories posted in June. “Ps… My name is Blu. Not Blu of Earth,” she wrote at the time, adding, “I do not identify as a witch. Y’all are hilarious.” Rodgers currently followers Blu on Instagram, where she posts about her “DeJa Blue” podcast, which has been described as “a clean reservoir of conciousness [sic] from which souls thirsty for purity, relief and love can drink.” Before his alleged relationship with Blu, Rodgers announced his engagement to Woodley in early 2021 before their breakup this year. He has also dated Danica Patrick and Olivia Munn.
