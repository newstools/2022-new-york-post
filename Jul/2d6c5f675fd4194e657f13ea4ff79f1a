“Baywatch” star Donna D’Errico has slammed trolls who tried to criticize her by insisting that she is “too old” to be posing in a bikini. The clap back came in response to the hate she received after posting a video of herself posing in an American flag bikini on the Fourth of July. “Quite a few women complained about the 4th of July video I posted in a red white & blue bikini because they thought I was ‘classier than that’ and ‘too old to wear a bikini’ and, my favorite, ‘desperate,'” D’Errico, 54, wrote in an Instagram post over the weekend. “Let me tell you something that might surprise you. I can actually wear and do literally whatever I want.” The star, who spent two years running around in the iconic tiny red swimsuit on the hit series, shared another sexy shot of herself in a light pink two-piece bikini. “On that note, here is me in a bikini squatting on a coffee table,” she added. Fans and Hollywood colleagues came to her defense and flooded her comments with support for her hot posts — and further applauded her confidence. “Gorgeous and F anyone who tries to tear you down. You look incredible period,” actress Tracey Bregman of “The Young and the Restless” said, cheering on her friend. “Be you. You are an amazing person no matter what,” David Toborowsky, star of “90 Day Fiance,” commented. Others insisted that her ageist haters must be “jealous” and “need to get a life.” “Good for you! If I looked that good I’d be posting pictures in a bikini every day!” added one fan, while another added, “I smell some ‘jealousy’ going on. You wear it well.”
