Johnny Depp will avoid another highly publicized court battle after reaching a settlement Monday with a crew member who accused him of assault. The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star had been set to go on trial in Los Angeles later this month over the claims from location manager Gregg “Rocky” Brooks, who sued Depp in July 2018. A notice of settlement was filed Monday. The terms were not released, but a hearing to dismiss the case was scheduled for February 16. Brooks accused Depp, 58, of punching him twice in the rib cage on the set of the crime thriller “City of Lies” in April 2017. The skirmish occurred after Brooks told the actor and the director that a scene featuring two of Depp’s friends wasn’t working, according to the suit. During the spat, Depp allegedly screamed at Brooks, “I’ll give you $100,000 to punch me right now!” Depp had been named as a witness in the assault trial according to an October 2019 witness list, though his reps couldn’t confirm if he would have testified. The settlement agreement comes after Depp’s victory last month in his closely-watched legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard. A jury in the defamation case ruled largely in his favor, awarding him $10.35 million in damages. Representatives for Depp and Brooks each didn’t immediately return requests for comment.
