The Buccaneers could be in jeopardy of losing one of Tom Brady’s top protectors. Tampa Bay center Ryan Jensen was carted off the field after suffering a knee injury at training camp on Thursday, according to head coach Todd Bowles and GM Jason Licht. Jensen was taken to the training room and will undergo tests to determine the severity of the injury. Licht said it could take up to several days before a diagnosis is determined due to swelling. The incident changed the whole mood of the practice, according to ESPN Bucs reporter Jenna Laine, who said Jensen’s teammates huddled around him as a golf cart came to get him. Jensen reportedly did not like being carted off the field and struggled while he attempted to walk under his own power. He also threw his helmet when the injury occurred and his teammates took a knee. Robert Hainsey — a third-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft — replaced Jensen at center after the injury. Jensen re-signed with the Buccaneers this offseason on a three-year, $39 million deal. The 31-year-old has played nearly every offensive snap for Tampa Bay since he joined the team in 2018, following four seasons with the Ravens.
