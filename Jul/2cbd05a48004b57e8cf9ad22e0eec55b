Even the actors are obsessed with the real estate in the buzzy HBO series “Succession,” as the homes offer insight into their identities and psyches. In season 3, princeling Kendall Roy — played by Jeremy Strong, who won an Emmy for his role — had a war room in his ex-wife’s downtown Manhattan luxury residence, where he plotted against his father Logan (Brian Cox) in a sort of modern-day form of financial regicide. Family members made pilgrimages there including Siobhan (Sarah Snook), cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), brother Roman (Kieran Culkin), Connor (Alan Ruck) and his new girlfriend, Naomi Pierce (Annabelle Dexter-Jones). Kendall’s home, in real life, was in the landmarked Woolworth Tower Residences, at 2 Park Place in lower Manhattan. That luxury residence, which first hit the market in 2019 and was last asking $23.35 million, just closed for $19.5 million, according to city property records. Known as Pavilion A, the five-bedroom, four-bath, two-powder room home on the 29th floor is 6,712 square feet and features a duplex terrace and 2,770 square feet of outdoor space to lounge, dine al fresco — and, of course, to scheme and plot. Details include an open chef’s kitchen, a curving industrial staircase, arched windows and a large great room. The building features 32 condos from floors 29 to 59, developed by Alchemy Properties. The building itself was designed by Cass Gilbert in 1913 and — rising 792 feet high — was once the tallest building in the world. Interiors are by Thierry Despont, who worked on the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, the makeover of the Ritz Paris and the Carlyle hotel here in New York. There’s also a lounge, an entertainment area, a wine cellar and tasting room, a gym and a 50-foot lap pool. Building amenities include a residential lobby with a coffered restored ceiling and repurposes from Frank W. Woolworth’s private office. The listing broker is Sotheby’s Joshua Judge.
