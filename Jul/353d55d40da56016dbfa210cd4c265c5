Prince Harry’s pals from England’s prestigious Eton College said he was “f- -king nuts” for dating Meghan Markle after she berated them for their “jokes about sexism, feminism and transgender people,” a new book claims. The Duke of Sussex invited Markle, then his girlfriend, to meet his friends during a shooting weekend at the royal family’s Sandringham country estate in 2016 for “endless banter, jokes — and a lot of drinking,” according to “Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War between the Windsors,” excerpts of which were obtained by the Sun. The group at Sandringham included 16 of Harry’s pals, as well as their wives and girlfriends. But Markle did not enjoy the comedy among the friends, according to the book, written by British journalist Tom Bower. “Without hesitation, Meghan challenged every guest whose conversation contravened her values,” the book claims. “According to Harry’s friends, again and again she reprimanded them about the slightest inappropriate nuance. Nobody was ­exempt.” Harry apparently “had not anticipated ­Meghan’s reaction.” The pals concluded that Markle was a “dampener on the party” and that Harry “must be f- -king nuts” for dating her. “She lacked any sense of humor,” the book reads. “Driving home after Sunday lunch, the texts pinged between the cars: ‘OMG, what about HER?’ ” This wasn’t the only time Meghan would clash with Harry’s friends. On a 2017 trip to Jamaica for the marriage of Harry’s childhood pal Tom “Skippy” Inskip, friends thought the former “Suits” star behaved “princessy.” During the three-day bash in Montego Bay, Markle, who arrived via private jet from Toronto, “refused to engage with Harry’s friends.” Instead, she made ”remarks about the food.”
