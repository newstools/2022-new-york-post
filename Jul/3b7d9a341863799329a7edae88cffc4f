Derek Chauvin, the former Minnesota police officer who killed George Floyd in 2020, was sentenced Thursday to 21 years in federal prison for violating his civil rights. Federal Judge Paul Magnuson blasted the disgraced ex-cop from the bench before handing down the steep sentence, which will run concurrently with the more than 22 years Chauvin is already serving on state convictions of murder and manslaughter. “I really don’t know why you did what you did,” the judge told Chauvin. “To put your knee on a person’s neck until they expired is simply wrong. … Your conduct is wrong and it is offensive.” Because of federal parole policies, Chauvin will likely serve more time behind bars than if he served only his sentence imposed by the judge in his state case. The ex-cop will also be transferred from Minnesota’s only maximum security state prison to federal prison because of the conviction. Magnuson also chided Chauvin for shattering the lives of three fellow police officers who were on scene when he killed Floyd – and who have each been convicted of federal crimes. “You absolutely destroyed the lives of three young officers by taking command of the scene,” the judge said. Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck after forcing him onto the ground outside of a convenience store in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Floyd screamed for his life and for his mother as the cop suffocated him to death by forcing his knee on the back of his neck. The killing, which was captured on bystander video, touched off a wave of racial justice protests and rioting across the globe. Chauvin was convicted in state court after a trial in April 2021. Judge Peter Cahill sentenced him to 22 1/2 years in state prison following the conviction. With Post wires
