The volunteer fire chief of a small New Jersey town was killed Monday in a motorcycle crash in South Brunswick. Helmetta Volunteer Fire Department Chief Christopher Acs, 47, was riding his motorcycle northbound on Georges Road when he was struck by a 2019 Honda Odyssey at around 3:20 p.m., police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene, My Central New Jersey reported. Acs’ death devastated the tight-knit communities of Helmetta, where he lived with his wife and two children. “Hearts are heavy in Helmetta as our community mourns the passing of our current Helmetta Fire Department Chief, Chris Acs,” Helmetta Mayor Chris Slavicek said in a statement on Facebook. “Appreciation is bestowed upon his selfless dedication to our community and for his service to others.” Acs was a 28-year veteran of the Helmetta Fire Department and also served as a deputy warden with the New Jersey State Forest Fire Service. “He was a devoted, dedicated member who worked tirelessly on the apparatus and the building throughout the years,” the Helmetta Fire Department said in a statement announcing Acs’ death. “His efforts on behalf of the Borough of Helmetta will be sorely missed.” Friends and family of Acs have started a GoFundMe to raise money for the family he leaves behind — his wife Laura; 15-year-old daughter Sophia, who is in high school and 11-year-old son Ethan, who is in middle school. “Chris was very giving of his time and talents and would often help friends and family without the need for thanks or acknowledgment,” organizer and close family friend Aimee Linke wrote in the GoFundMe page description. “Now it’s time to call upon his village – of friends, family, colleagues, and firefighters to help support his family.” “Taken way too soon from us just days after his 47th Birthday, his kind-hearted nature, quiet smile and ability to tinker with and fix anything will be deeply missed,” Linke wrote.
