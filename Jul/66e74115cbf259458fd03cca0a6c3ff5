Welcome back to the second (and last day) of our version of the Super Bowl: Amazon Prime Day 2022. The retailer’s two-day event, which started yesterday, July 12 and ends tonight, July 13, at midnight, is filled with incredible savings on waitlist-inducing items from some of its best-selling products, backyard-ready outdoor patio furniture and more. If you’re new to our Prime Day coverage, we’re giving you the 411 every few minutes to ensure you’re spending your money wisely, receiving alerts for almost-gone items and reading our favorite deals. Yesterday’s live blog provided incredible deals (some may even still be available today, so make sure to check it out), but Day 2 is filled with all the fresh finds we can’t wait to buy ourselves. So, it’s time to get to shopping. Now’s crunch time — find the best last-chance items of Amazon Prime Day before they go back to regular pricing. Please check retailer websites for any price and inventory changes that may have changed since our individual blog posts.
