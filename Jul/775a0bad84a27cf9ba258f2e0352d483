A woman who remarried her ex and is happy being a “bonus mom” to the child he had while they weren’t together has the trolls in a frenzy. Georgia Lawrence shares her family life on TikTok. She explained that, after she and her husband divorced, he had a daughter with someone else. In a video in which she and a young girl — presumably the daughter he had with someone else — smile, dance and twirl, she relays the comments people have sent her that include “You have no self respect if you go back to an ex.” In another video, Lawrence says the daughter is loved just as much as her biological kids and calls herself her “bonus mom.” She credits this daughter as to why the pair didn’t work out the first time, because it was “fate” that his daughter would be born. But this hasn’t stopped comments from rolling in about both her as an individual and her relationship — despite her and her husband being remarried for three years now. Some common responses revolve around her husband’s daughter with people telling Georgia, “That’s not your kid” and “Where’s the real mom?” Lawrence claps back by mentioning that biology doesn’t have any involvement in loving a kid, and you earn the title of “mom” instead of just being given it. The video has more than 60,000 views and very few trolls in the comments. Most of them showed support for Lawrence and told her to just keep doing her thing. “People are pathetic! You enjoy your life and good for you, your husband and kids!” one person said. “That baby is so lucky to have twice the love! Her biological mom and her bonus mom,” said another. A few people even felt they could relate to her story. “My husband remarried me after I left and had another child.. we have 2 older children! It works,” another comment read.
