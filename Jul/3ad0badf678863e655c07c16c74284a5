Two siblings have been charged with the murder of a woman in her New Jersey home one day after a fight over a $100 debt, according to newly obtained court documents. Travis Leiby, 34, and Brittany Murdza, 32, are accused in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old Starquasia Harris during a home invasion in Trenton on January 29, 2020, according to NJ.com. Leiby and Murdza allegedly targeted Harris after the murdered woman and a relative of the suspects got into a fight over $100 the day before, documents obtained by the outlet said. The siblings had been visiting their relative’s home when they learned of the fight. Witnesses claimed seeing the two leave the relative’s house and return shortly after. A man matching Leiby’s description was seen entering Harris’ home and firing a gun, documents said. Leiby and Murdza claimed they were on the street just before the murder but had driven away before shots were fired. The pair, who describe themselves as siblings as Murdza’s mother and Leiby’s father were in a long-term relationship, were arrested in July 2020 and charged with murder, burglary and firearm charges, the outlet reported. They are both originally from Trenton, but had been living in Philadelphia at the time of the killing. The two are each currently in custody at county jails awaiting court appearances at Mercer County Superior Court.
