Ivana Trump’s funeral at a historic Manhattan church on Wednesday was a glamorous final tribute to the 1980s style icon — complete with extravagant rose arrangements and a blown-up copy of her Vanity Fair magazine cover. Roughly 100 mourners gathered inside St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church on the Upper East Side to bid farewell to the businesswoman and ex-wife of former President Donald Trump who died last week at 73. Two large gold-framed images of Ivana were placed next to her casket, including her 1992 Vanity Fair cover with the words “Ivana Be A Star” emblazoned across it. Hillary Clinton’s name was also featured on the 1992 cover — but had been removed from the version on display during Ivana’s memorial. The second framed photo also appeared to be an old magazine cover featuring the headline “Better than ever … Ivana Trump.” The century-old cathedral was also adorned with hundreds of red roses and candles for the opulent service. The invitation-only funeral had been billed as a “Celebration of Life” — and the invite featured a photo of Ivana hitting the slopes. Donald Trump and his three eldest children he shared with Ivana — Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric — were all in attendance. The former president’s wife Melania, their son Barron and Trump’s other daughter Tiffany were also among the mourners. Ivana, who died after a fall in her home, was remembered as “a force of nature” and “the embodiment of the American dream.”
