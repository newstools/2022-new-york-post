Four years after signing off of “Big Brother” by adding her embattled husband’s last name to her own, host Julie Chen Moonves finally explained why she chose to reference her controversial partner. Chen Moonves’ husband, Les Moonves, stepped down as the CEO of CBS in 2018 following allegations of workplace misconduct and sexual harassment. Another victim alleged that he tried to silence her by offering her a job at the network. The couple married in 2004, but Chen Moonves told Deadline that she originally chose to keep her maiden name while referring to herself on the show “because I thought it could be seen as an unfair advantage. It was a powerful, popular name to have. And I had made my own career prior to knowing him. So I wanted to keep that.” But her “spur of the moment” decision to adjust her moniker came from wanting to defend her husband’s name. “I was, like, toying with it and I remember my heart racing while I thought, ‘Am I gonna do it?’ It just became a moment. I think he was just like, ‘What happened?’ ” Chen Moonves said, remembering her husband’s reaction to her abrupt change, which she made in the Sept. 13, 2018 episode. “And then when his name was getting dragged through the mud, I thought, ‘This is the time to make my stand and to let the world know who I am,’ ” she continued. “And it was a sign of support for my husband. I know him. And he is a good man.” Chen Moonves has hosted “Big Brother” since 2000, and Season 23 kicks off Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.
